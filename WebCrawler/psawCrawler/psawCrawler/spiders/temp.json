Thank you all for the content you provide: the articles and releases you post, the reports you file, the upvotes you dish out, the comments you downvote only because they're off-topic (pls), the all-caps exclamations, the passionate discussions, the translations you fake with Google Translate hoping the mods wont notice but we totally do, the love you share, the memes you shitpost, and so much more. Through the celebrations and the hardships, this community does a genuinely exceptional job of coming together and supporting each other over the shared love of this ~~fanatic obsession~~ genre we all know and love. \n\nAs always, if you have any questions, comments, or insults, we're always just a modmail away. We love the feedback and really love seeing the way this sub changes and evolves over time. 2017 was there year of \"Features\" on r/kpop: from artist spotlights, to the Jukebox, to Top 10 Tuesdays, to Two Week Laters, to Throwback Thursdays, to all the others I'm missing. Thank you to those donating that time and effort to putting that type of content together; we want to emphasize that it really is appreciated and the sub is a much better place because of it. \n\nIt is truly a pleasure to get to serve this community each and every day. To those of you new to the subreddit this year: welcome! To those of you who have been here since the beginning: welcome back! We're excited to see what 2018 has in store and can't wait to share those wonderful moments with you all. \n\nThank you, all. Happy 2018!\n\n\\- The Modteam \n",

      "What/who would be your song, album, and artist of the year if it was 100% based on your personal preference?\n\nThought it'd be interesting to see everyone's picks. (Plus I'm hoping to find some hidden gems I missed throughout the year.)\n\nI tried my best to only include each artist once so there was some more variety.\n\nFor me:\n\n**[Song - SEVENTEEN's Change Up/Kim Lip's Eclipse]** *I couldn't pick between the two!*\n\n**[Album - DAY6's Sunrise]** *Had the hardest time deciding this category because I thought there were so many amazing albums this year.*\n\n**[Artist - BTS]** *This one was between either BTS or IU for me because I think she absolutely owned this year. But I think the growth I've seen from BTS and what they've done/achieved for not only themselves this year, but for Kpop as a whole, they definitely deserve this spot. This coming from a non-Army. Really looking forward to what they do next.*\n\n**Honorable mentions:**\n\n**Songs:**\n\n* Seo In Guk - BeBe\n\n* Brave Girls - Rollin'\n\n* Hyuna - BABE\n\n* CLC - Call My Name\n\n* Laboum - Hwi Hwi\n\n* Loona - Sweet Crazy Love\n\n* Astro - Crazy Sexy Cool\n\n* Red Velvet - Peek-A-Boo\n\n* KARD - Into You\n\n* Melomance - Gift\n\n**Albums:**\n\n* NCT 127 - Limitless\n\n* JJ Project - Verse 2\n\n* Bobby - Love And Fall\n\n* MONSTA X - The Clan part 2.5\n\n* Royal Pirates - Hasta la Vista\n\n* Bolbbalgan4 - Red Diary page 1\n\n**Artists:**\n\n* Everything IU this year, especially 밤편지 (Through the Night) & 이런 엔딩 (Ending Scene). That Palette album was a masterpiece.\n\n* Red Velvet  *Releasing bops left and right.*\n\n* MONSTA X  *Both their albums this year were amazing.*\n\nEdit: formatting",

      "Which group do you think the most friendliest among K-Pop Groups and their members? Like how they interact with other groups, or had a close relationship with one or more members in that group because they were friends before their respective debuts. Maybe they got known each other while promoting at the same time.\n\nI would like to pick GFriend as the friendliest group, because of their beagle-like personality, everyone can be their friend (Buddy reference).  I will first list the groups/members that have connection with GFriend then I'll proceed with individual members (if there are group members that I haven't mentioned, sorry for that):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**GFriend**\n\nTwice - they are considered to be rivals by most kpop followers but they are actually **friends** [(GFriend performed Like Ooh-Ahh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Os5wuyPEks), [(Twice performed Me Gustas Tu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAM_swBFUSM), [(Both performed Gee)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kva3820DDw). They were guested twice together on Weekly Idol (2015 Christmas Special & 5th Anniversary) and there are more...\n\nMamamoo - GFriend is the innocent version of them because of their beagle-like personality. [GFriend invading Mamamoo's waiting room on VLive broadcast](http://www.vlive.tv/video/6354). They were both guested on the [7th season of Showtime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0ViB7lSiBGYRwXYQY2qoQ). They were both guested on [Weekly Idol Summer Vacation Special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3sHWGoe-L4).\n\nHeechul - Heechul ~~is just a GFriend trash/~~have a deep connection to GFriend when Yerin starred to his music video.\n\nBTS - both CEO of their companies are best friends. I just take this with a grain of salt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sowon** (DSP Media trainee before joining Source Music)\n\nFriends with Pristin's Nayoung & Apink's Namjoo. Has in touch with KARD members.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Yerin** (Fantagio trainee before joining Source Music)\n\nHave a close relationship with Heechul until now since she was starred on M&D's [I Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6lH6g1Z97E) as Heechul's girlfriend.

She also has a connection with Block B's Park Kyung because of their collaboration [Inferiority Complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL2E1JDw2cA).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Yuju** (LEON trainee before joining Source Music)\n\nYuju have a really close relationship with Dia's Chaeyeon.

BUT after I joined I became crazy interested in various girl groups. (common case for many)\n\n* I have lived in US for couple of years, so while I can write/read English, I might make some mistakes. ~~[Deal with it](http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Owl-Deal-With-It.gif)~~ and would be happy to fix any typo or grammar mistakes if you point them out.\n\n* My personal favorite groups are Gfriend (Yerin esp) and Lovelyz (Kei esp). Recently liking Dreamcatcher (Jiu esp)and Oh My Girl(Yooa esp) too. Getting into soloists like Sunmi, Chungha and Sohee too! And I have been doing some Vlive subs too! (mostly Dreamcatcher though my friends in Owl Sub [twitter link](https://twitter.com/OwlSubs)  [vlive link](http://subtitle.vlive.tv/team/Team161)  )\n\n* Most liked to listen songs are Rough(Gfriend) Now We (Lovelyz) Fly High (Dreamcatcher) \n\n***\n**How we Korean soliders react to K-pop**\n***\n\n* Mostly through TV (has internet-cable) that is in each room(dormitory?), we usually watch Music shows such as Music Bank/Show Champion/M Countdown and variety shows. Rewatching good live performances and shows with girl singers in them is common.\n\n* A lot listen to K-pop with MP3 (which is allowed as long as in Air Force if it does not have any wireless connection) and using computer service (we can use it after 'work time' is over for free, though it is limited to 2 hours at once)\n\n* Some buy music from legal sources but many just pirate it. Very few buy physical album.\n\n* Not much of merch bought, but some do buy posters and calendars. (I was responsible for bringing a lot of Maxim posters -often sexy kpop idols- around base.)\n\n* Most do not take part in official fandom(s), and are light fans of multifandom. Males tend to be like that.\n\n* Want to specify we have to serve our service in 20s, and most choose to go early to get it done with. So 'creepy old man perving on young girls' stereotype is off. (Heck a lot of times we are cheering 'We love you noona!')\n\n***\n**The popularity rank among soliders** I made from general opinion - Will add more\n\n\n(Inactive/disbanded groups (ex: After School, BEG, 2NE1) are not in the list to keep it from getting too messy), and it is likely that they are interest about such groups in military when there are so many attractive active girls. (Yes this includes legendary groups like ex-trinity gg SNSD, Wonder Girls, Kara too)\n\n***\n**Nation's GG**\n***\n\n**Twice**\n\n- The unmatched girl group of present days. Or as some like to say, the Nation's Girl Group.\n\n- 'Debate' over who is best member is common. Most rooting for Sana/Momo/Tzuyu.\n\n- People do know they are not that talented in terms of singing or dancing, but they are very effective with doing enough to follow/copy and like.\n\n***\n**Elite Four**\n***\n\n**Red Velvet**\n\n- Had been out and in of S rank depending on the last song.\n\n- But their company, SM is rich and pushing them hard with power of money well since Red Room.\n\n\n**Gfriend**\n\n- Pure/cute concept on stage, but very beagle-like (outward, comedic, playful etc). The contrast is very charming to a lot of people.\n\n- Is considered 'rival' of Twice often. Mostly due to contrasting images. (Gfriend having Korean lyrics mostly, 80/90s feeling Vs Twice being Western slangs, modern feeling)\n\n\n**Blackpink**\n\n- Company and selling power is S rank worthy but fandom is too weak yet. Mostly thanks to YG not showing them anywhere.\n\n\n**Mamamooo**\n\n- Liked widely with only few haters. Their talented singing ability and quirky personalities made even those usually uninterested in girlgroups like them.\n\n\n***\n**Veterans Still Strong**\n***\n\n**Apink**\n\n- Good songs+Known Well+ Strong Fandom. Even if they are weaker then they used to be, still tough for 7 year old group\n\n- Members' variety and drama appearance most get praises and keeps the public liking them too.\n\n\n**Girl's Day**\n\n- Had being out of game too long, but is still widely known and selling well with recent return.\n\n- Hyeri is still a CF queen too.\n\n**EXID**\n\n- Really popular thanks to truly strong sexy concept, but this also makes them target of some haters.\n\n- Sells well and is known well. But fandom size is small compared to their popularity with public.\n\n- Lack of Solji voice is taking toll though, hope she could comeback soon.\n\n\n**AOA**\n\n- Seolhyun is all over the country with all kind of advertisements.\n\n- Not sure what Choa's department means for the group, she was such iconic voice and was reponsible for keeping fans entertained.\n\n***\n**Gatekeeper between 'popular' and 'not really'**\n***\n\n**Lovelyz**\n\n- Nicknamed 'The Gatekeeper' for not being strong enough to be solidly on A rank but is far stronger compared to B ranks.\n\n- Album sells quite well now thanks to getting a win to get a public attention.\n\n- Fandom has lots of 30+ and older fans with strong loyalty, so they are good at buying stuff but weak when it comes to votes and such.\n\n\n***\n**Just a bit more for 1st win and recognization..**\n***\n\n\n**Oh My Girl**\n\n\n- Many agree they have potential to be A or even S rank, with right push.\n\n- Seems to be casually liked by many, including other fandoms(because a lot of idols like OMG, their fans give attention to OMG), but doesnt really translate to strong fandom.\n\n- YooA is one of variety chip idol, shown a lot in various shows and make public interested in her and her group.\n\n- Coloring Book had mixed receptions. JinE unable to comeback and long hiatus killed momentum a bit sadly.\n\n\n**Cosmic Girls**\n\n- Cheng Xiao being variety chip and Yeung Jung addition boost them some much needed popularity boost.\n\n- Mixed feelings and opinions losing Secret and I Wish 'spacy' concept and going for more Cheerleader-vibe Happy and Kiss Me though.\n\n\n**Pristin**\n\n- Had a solid start, properly carried produce 101 hype with some TV variety appearances and mini concerts.\n\n- Nayoung and Kyulkyung very popular, both to male and female.\n\n- But title songs had very mixed receptions.\n\n***\n**Couple good push from being big**\n***\n\n**Laboum**\n\n- Solbin carried the team hard and is selling well. Quite popular among soldiers because they often come do military-related events. They came to our base too!\n\n- Unfortunately sajaegi incident + Wolhee dating scandal/leaving have taken toll to the group.\n\n\n**Weki Meki**\n\n- Yoojung+Doyeon being very popular duo helps team a lot.\n\n- But questionable title song/concept has mixed opinions.\n\n\n**Gugudan**\n\n- Again, Post IOI members, Sejoung and Mina's popularity carrying group hard.\n\n- Weird concepts has been hit or miss.\n\n\n**Nine Muses**\n\n- Being sexy noona makes them very liked with military.\n\n- Kyungri is popular after hilarious appearances at God of Music 2\n\n- Unfortunately after God of Music 2 hype, nothing really to carry that hype.\n\n\n**April**\n\n- Chakyung addition (CIVA hype!) + April Story was good. (but was not successful enough)\n\n- Unfortunately DSP is bad with giving them good titles public would love.\n\n\n***\n**Niche Queens**\n***\n\n\n**Dreamcatcher**\n\n- Unique concept reminding of some anime with rare rock sound that can be hard to find. Fills niche uncovered.\n\n- Going for niche concept has grown them popularity with people who will like them quickly, but can be holding back from being more publicly popular. (In other words, weebs quickly love them, others not much)\n\n**Loona / Girl of the Month**\n\n- Multi concept of talented girls debuting with solo release is a unique way has caught attention of some who were looking for new things.\n\n- Unfortunately, the company's attempt on different promotions like bus stop advertisement is not effective.\n\n\n***\n**Out of Nugudom. Barely**\n***\n\n\n**CLC**\n\n- They are relatively unpopular among soldiers but they are more of girlcrush, and sell quite well outside, thanks to female fans.\n\n- Sudden concept changes back and forth hurts fandom staying royal.\n\n\n**Sonamoo**\n\n- Very talented and beautiful members surprise a lot of people that they are unknown.\n\n- D-ANA appearance from IDOT helped her and group's popularity well.\n\n- Eujin is carrying atm with Unit no.1\n\n- Possibly the group with worst name ever. Imo. (Yes I have strong feelings about this.)\n\n- ex: Pinetree has been associated with old guys' royalty to their king/boss for a while in Korea.\nNot really something that connects with young, sexy girls.\n\n\n**Dia**\n\n- Barely surviving only thanks to Chae-yeon, whose face can be easily seen with many ads.\n\n\n**Momoland**\n\n- JooE the meme-ad queen. But what else?\n\n\n**Brave Girls**\n\n- Liked a lot among military for being powerful sexy noonas, but failing to grab public attention.\n\n**Stellar**\n\n- They grabbed our attention with Marionette being super sexy.\n\n- Then messy management with member change killed most of hype.\n\n\n***\n\n**Short summary of boy groups ~~tolerated~~ liked in military**\n\n***\n\nBigBang used to be undisputable no.1 bg among males, but Top's controversy has dropped the public likness quite significantly... (the point that he isn't going to do standard service being biggest)\n\nOlder groups who tend to focus a lot on vocal + hilarious on variety are often casually liked by guys too from what I have seen. (Ex Highlight, B1A4, BtoB, Infinite)\n\nThere was some casual fans of Seventeen with their ‘fun’ songs like Aju Nice, but that interest was largely gone with Don’t Wanna Cry which felt more mature and less fun.\n\nI did couple of guys appreciating Exo and WannaOne, but more of casual praise in passing then anything from fan.\n\n\n***\n**Some random stuff you guys are probably interested in.**\n***\n\n- Pd101 was considered ridiculous at first, but soon enough most were crazy about it, some doing fanwars about who is better girl. But we did not give a care about ~~bois version~~ season 2.\n\n- Unit and Mixnine haven't gotten that much interest yet, and it seems public has gotten tired of such survival shows, but those who did watch it seemed to prefer latter.\n\n- One of officers I am close with mentioned Nayoung (pre-IOI, now Pristin member) was popular in his town as something of 'Sleeping Beauty' - the attractive, popular girl who slept through every class except for PE and lunch break.\n\n- Not really related to Kpop, but someone joked about two rappers in High School Rap (Hiphop competition for high schoolers from Mnet) were gay when they started showing some bromance, and others watching took it...quite maturely well. 'I am glad homos are can stand up now' 'Brave of them to show up.' 'Kind of others for not judging' etc.  \n\n- I asked some comrades (prob wrong word choice but I am discharged now, whatever) about their views on gay after that. Most common answer was 'As long as they are not after my ass, I don't give a shit about someone being gay.' and 'Guess more gays means more chance for me to get a girl'\n\n***\n**Stuffs some of you have asked me.**\n***\n\n>Do people care about Nate/Ilbe comments and posts?\n\nWhile they are popular sites, they are considered something like to how 4chan is viewed. People don't really care about what these sites say unless it goes viral over other SNS.\n\n\n>How do you gauge how popular a group is? / How did you made this list of popularity order?\n\nThere are several ways to try to gauge a group's popularity. All of them controversial or lacking in some ways but one can try adding it all up and give an attempt.\n\n*Album sales - Physical*\n\nThis often shows the power of fandom, because it is usually hardcore fans who buy albums, a lot of them buying more than one for supporting their fav. That and fansign lottery, which is huge motivation. \n\nThere are soft 'cut' which is the least of amount of album you have to be sure to get into a group's fansign, which changes upon the group's popularity and quality of album. \n\n(Boy groups tend to have high album sale thanks to strong fandom, which often get competitive with each other)\n\n*Stream/download - Digital*\n\nThis often shows the power of light fan (public appeal), because a lot of people use streaming service to listen to music, so people who aren't invested enough to buy album and do other core fan stuff, are likely to stream and download their songs.\n\n(Girl groups tend to have chart high in such ranks because they easier to be generally liked by public.)\n\n*Variety appearance - TV*\n\nSomething that I personally think is overshadowed by i-fandom. A good variety appearance can solidify good number of core fans and introduce the group/member shown to public, which can be huge popularity boost.\n\nAnd also when they are on more popular shows (ex Knowing Bros, Infinite Challenge), it often also means they have gotten popular enough for such shows to try putting them on as guests.\n\n\n*Advertisement - Various*\n\nWhen groups/members get plastered over tv/internet/shops/streets for commercials, you know they got popular enough for advertising companies try using them.\n\n*Concert - Tickets*\n\nBeing able to plan out and sell out concerts is proof of having enough dedicated fandom.\n\n>Will you do most popular member list?\n\nI tried making this after some request, found it hard if not impossible to make and has given up on this.\n\n\n>Can you teach me Korean?\n\n>Can you translate this for me?\n\nNo. I won’t. /r/korean has lots of helpful people and guides, head over there if you want help.\n\n[I did make a *very* seldom updated Korean often slang list though!](https://www.reddit.com/r/OwlOfJune/comments/6gcd4b/kpop_term_list_wip/?st=jbxji6x8&sh=e3d328d5)\n\n>Can I take this and post it elsewhere?\n\nSure, just leave my Reddict nickname and send me a link.\n\nI know Koreaboo has taken my older post, while I don’t mind it, would prefer they do notify me.\n\nThrough reddit or email owlofjune@daum.net would be nice. I do have twitter https://twitter.com/owlofjune , though mostly abandoned is option to send re-post links.\n\n\n\n>YOU HAVE PUT *MY FAV* NOT AS NATION’S GG?

He's been off doing solo stuff in China and hasn't been with EXO for a while (most of 2017???). I've been told it's regarding ROK-China relations souring because of THAAD. But I don't know if this makes sense because Seventeen's Chinese members (Jun and Minghao) haven't really had any massive issues with... anything?\n\n I don't know if this makes sense, but I guess my question is, is Lay being away from EXO actually about tricky international politics? Or is it something like (I'm purely guessing) Lay probably wants to leave like the other Chinese members did, but SM doesn't want the lawsuit or drama so they let him do what he wants under their management?",

        "body": "**Song:  [Twice's Knock Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A2t_tAjMz8).**  The song is interesting because it's like two songs in the same package.  The most recognizable one is the high bpm banger that is easily their most Western-friendly title track.  That song is fun, colorful, and energetic like you would expect from Twice.  The second is a darker, sadder song that is kind of buried beneath the first.  It first comes in around a minute into Knock Knock, marked by a haunting three note instrumental that continues to be heard on and off until the end of the song.  The different songs align with the lyrics and MV's story in that the girls are both hopeful and frustrated with their situation:  on one hand they could end up happily ever after (fun song) or in a bad place (sad song).  As Knock Knock and it's MV ends, we end up seeing which one wins out.  *Hon. Mentions:  [CLC - I Like It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ2u7pIyV9I), [Twice - Heart Shaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRzxEiBLQCA), [Yves (LOONA) - New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIDe-yTxda0).*\n\n**Album:  [Dreamcatcher's Prequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slLETkWs3Tk).**  Usually kpop albums might only have one or two b-sides that I even remotely like, but Prequel is one of the few albums this year where I liked every song.  Also, not only did I like every song, but I had all of them on repeat for a long time due to how good they were.  *Hon. Mentions:  [Nine Muses: Love City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLGxLWyYDEY), [CLC - FREE*SM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmkGTSGHYHo).*\n\n**Artist: Twice.**  They busted their asses and gave me so much content this year that giving the award to any other act would be criminal.  *Hon. Mentions:  BTS, LOONA.*\n\n**Music Video:  [N.Flying's The Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUYzVohEAyE).**  I knew right away that this was probably going to be my MVOTY.  It has atmosphere, comedy, story, and a fun twist of an ending.  The music is great too, and both elements mesh well together.  The Real and [One More Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoOEry-Yc4) were the only MVs this year that made me genuinely laugh.  *Hon.

For the album category I'll link my favorite non-title track from each album.\n\n**Song - [NCT 127's Limitless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmUn7V6uuZM)**\nThis song blew me away from the day it was released. The beat is killer, and the production sounds so full in a way that's really appealing to me. It's a great song to listen to with headphones. And Johnny's one line! It's so good! I'm literally unable to skip this if it comes on shuffle, so it has to be the song of the year.for me. \n\n**Album - [GOT7's Flight Log: Arrival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ1t7CwfvEc)**\nI feel like no one else will pick this and that most people preferred 7 for 7, and that's okay. I LOVE Never Ever and there's only one song on the whole album that I didn't love. It has so much relisten value for me, and it's just... fun. Love it. \n\n**Artist - [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vJFn10XLQM)**\nThis will surprise no one. They forced their way into my ultimate bias group spot at the beginning of the year and I'm glad they did. I really just appreciate the variety of things they've managed to release and accomplish this year: so many collabs, solo work, a solid repackage and good mini, a huge international tour, USA media appearances... it's all impressive and they've put so much care and hard work into it. \n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n**Song**\n\n* [NCT 127 - Cherry Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkuHLzMMTZM)\n\n* [Super Junior - Black Suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvqB6JsRbsc)\n\n* [Monsta X - Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Zedh_5DDM)\n\n* [Suran feat.

SM seriously knows how to deliver both quality and quantity. Cohesive, dynamic, flawless albums - except KKB is a small miss for me :( However, I am utterly swept away by Universe\n\nHonorable mention to Epik High's We've Done Something Wonderful, Taemin's MOVE\n\n**Artist - BTS** \n\nThey dragged me into kpop through the BBMA's (thanks baes) - and while I've loved the joy of exploring new artists in the genre; for everything they've created and achieved this year, ultimately makes them the full package as artists.

Excludes OSTs.)\n\n* **WINNER - Really Really**\n* Yoon Jong Shin - Like It\n* Heize - You, Clouds, Rain\n* Sunmi - Gashina\n* Red Velvet - Red Flavor\n\n\n**Hon. Mention:** Due to quality of the song: Last Goodbye, HyukOh's Tomboy, Missing You (BTOB), Yesterday (Block B). Due to replay value - AIIYL, The Black Skirts' Who Do You Love. Impact - We Are, Nayana.\n\n**Winner:** WINNER lol. Its a bit biased honestly. It was between WINNER and Yoon Jong Shin based on highest sales for idol/non-idol + songs I have genuinely loved - WINNER won because I felt it has had more impact for the whole year. Could've been Gashina if it were released a bit early on in the year, RV's in a similar position - RF felt more like a Summer Hit than a SOTY because of this - same goes for Heize's and AKMU's songs - they felt more seasonal than year round hits.\n\n**ArOTY Nominations:** (Completely Unbiased. Purely based on how much I've heard about them this year.)\n\n* IU\n* **TWICE**\n* Bolbbalgan4\n* Heize\n* BTS\n\n**Hon. Mention:** WINNER, RV, HIGHLIGHT, N'uest for me.\n\n**Winner:** Twice. They had more comebacks this year than my. favs have had in their entire career. RIP. But all the nominations in this particular category are *really* solid. All of them killed it this year. IU and BTS follow. IU's sales while great are actually beaten by Bolbbalgan4 this year so it'd be unfair to them had she won. BTS and TWICE both did great but if BTS'd won it'd be unfair to TWICE who have worked their ass off more than anyone this year.\n\n**Album:** (Not based on sales - based on albums I listened to the most this year + Overall quality of the album.)\n\n* IU - Palette\n* GD - Kwon Ji Yong\n* PSY - 4 x 2 = 8\n* HyukOh - 23\n* Bolbbalgan4 - Red Diary/Red Planet\n* **Epik High - WDSW**\n\n**Hon. Mention:** Zion.T's 'OO'\n\n**Winner:** ~~GD's Kwon Ji Yong. I've talked about this before a million times but I think this is the most serious album GD's given us. From start to finish feels like a well thought out way to summarize Kwon Ji Yong's life.~~ Love GD but WDSW is perfect beyond imagination.

Can’t really choose one apart from another, only know that my ears have been enjoying all 3 albums since their release \n\nArtist - IU \n\nIs this even a question? 12million downloads (if I’m wrong, correct me please), 600+ million streams, PAKs for TTN, Can’t love you anymore, Palette, Autumn Morning, Epik High’s collab.

I can't even describe why I love it so much. I especially love the chorus. One of my most played songs of the year. Other honorable mentions are GD's BULLSHIT and Taemin's Thirsty.\n\n**Album - The War: The Power Of Music**\n\nEver since it came out, I've listened to it almost everyday. Is that just my being a fan? Maybe, but I love it. The repackage just made it even better. I loved KoKoBop, and that was my least favorite song. Honestly, the only other albums that stood a chance against this one for me is 'Universe' and 'Perfect Velvet'. Those are the only other two albums that I loved in their entirety too.\n\n**Artist - IU**\n\nSay what you want, IU has had an amazing year. sure, many people would pick other artists, but I just feel like she's had the best year of the lot. She was unstoppable in 2017 and I can't want to see what 2018 has in store for her. Honorable mentions are BTS for obvious reasons, Wanna One because they've just had a massive boom that I honestly didn't expect and they've rocked it and TWICE, because they, too, have been unstoppable.",

The sibling duo wins it for me again though, their songs are just so fun to listen to. \n\n**[Artist of the Year: DAY6]**\n\nThis was the easiest choice for me. About two fantastic songs every month for the whole year?! I really hope JYPE continues the Every6 promotional schedule, because it was incredible.\n\n**[Song of the Year: WINNER - \"Love Me Love Me\"]**\n \nI know WINNER's \"Really Really\" did amazing on the charts, but this was hands down my favorite song of the year. I didn't get to post in the \"favorite songs of the year\" thread earlier, so I'll include some other of my favorites here:\n\n\n* [Millic, Club Eskimo - \"Igloo\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MZD0L-MJDs) (Also really liked his [Fanxy Child song, \"Paradise\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fex-Fz3t2g))\n\n* [G-Dragon - \"Middle Fingers Up\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iU0vwvcaG0)\n\n* [DAY6 - \"I Need Somebody\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87a47NhL8VM) (also really really loved \"You Were Beautiful\" and \"How Can I Say\")\n\n* [BLACKPINK - \"As If It's Your Last\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq-qlqbjYA)\n\n* [AKMU - \"You Know Me\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWw6VUw_er8)\n\n* [Code Kunst, Lee Hi - \"X\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl9LYUUrVAQ)\n\n* [Loco - \"A.O.M.G.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OpFWqjMGWY)\n\n* [offonoff, Dean - \"gold\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgeijHtv0ic)\n\n* [Epik High, The Quiett, Mino, SimonD - \"No Thanxxx\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrDjdsfrrRM)\n\n* [Dreamcatcher - \"Sleep-Walking\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_GcbZlDnns)\n\nThere's a good amount I wish I could include (SMTM/ZionT/Sunmi/Zico/Bobby/One/Sechskies/etc.), but I tried to limit myself to ten different artists' songs. 2017 was a great year, music wise.",

But anyway. Avoiding overlap between categories, those would be my five nominees; and I'd go with Clap because it's a feel good banger, plus the performances of it are fantastic. \n\n**Album**\n\n* Seohyun - Don't Say No\n* Triple H - 199X\n* MAMAMOO - Purple\n* BTS - Love Yourself: Her\n* G.Soul - Circles\n\nHere I'd go with MAMAMOO - Purple. It's quirky, fun, 100% MMM. Bonus points for Moonbyul solo. I await their comeback anxiously. \n\n**Artist**\n\n* EXO \n* LOONA \n* NCT-127\n* EXID\n* Dreamcatcher\n\nFor this one I'd go with EXO, a predictable choice maybe but everything they've released this year has been great, between The War, Universe, and EXO-CBX's work. Although on a more personal level LOONA is my artist of the year, with how they've come to define my identity as a kpop stan, and how I've fallen in love with their project.",

Everything about the feeling of this song is just insane, and Taemin brings it out oozing sexiness. Amazing song.\n\n\n**Album: *Red Velvet - Perfect Velvet*.** I haven't listened to a lot of full albums this year, but Red Velvet's latest album just blew me away. There's not a single song on there that I ever have any intention of skipping (which is so so rare for me) and I'm in love with the new interpretation of their Velvet side.This album actually really made me fall for RV again after I'd kind of dropped off in early 2016 so I adore it for that too.\n\n\n**Artist: *EXO*.** This may be a little controversial, but EXO is definitely artist of the year in my eyes. From becoming a quadruple million seller and out performing with their full album *The War* better than ever, and having a decent run in the public downloads and charts with *KoKoBop* EXO have been working almost non-stop for the last half of this year. They were working on 2 separate albums and 3 MVs at the same time (*KKB, Power, Electric Kiss*) and all whilst also preparing for a new concert tour. They toured in North America, and by all accounts did an amazing job.  EXO-CBX had a great Japanese debut, and *Universe* is definitely their best winter album to date. The start of their ElyXiOn tour which showed a whole new side to the showmanship of EXO, and finally some new variety show appearances (KB was hilarious)! All while one of their members is in China unable to participate with the group because of politics, and as netizens tear them apart for simple things like having V-Lives and talking with their fans. It was a tough year in some ways,but they fought through it and came out on top. This year will be even better.",

They seem to be the second K-pop act at that show/series ever, following Psy..?  \n\nHowever, I haven't heard of BTS at all in a \"gone viral\" manner or otherwise, and I figured that a more well-known group like Girls' Generation (❤) would appear on the show first before a relatively newer (and lesser-known worldwide?) group like BTS..\n\nBut in any case, BTS did a great job with their \"DNA\" performance (the \"human mesh\" choreography looked especially neat to me 😂👍); I was looking forward to seeing their second performance (which appears to contain the song named \"Mic Drop\", based on what I have read) once I heard about it coming up, but apparently, thanks to local ABC affiliate scheduling, I never saw BTS's second NYRE performance live.. (😭).\n\nProps to the NYRE crew for giving BTS (and by extension, the K-pop genre) primetime exposure in the United States of America, though; it's nice to have more avenues/chances of discovering good-sounding foreign music..  \"DNA\" by BTS was actually one of the catchier songs of the night for me (at least it was higher-energy than the performance after it, Khalid's \"Location\" >_>) and made for great music discovery..!\n\nI'm kind of shocked that the BTS performance was apparently recorded about ~1-1.5 months ago, though..  I could understand pre-recorded footage from the past few days/1 week or so, but a month+ seems excessive, especially when the appeal of NYRE seems to be the \"live\" aspect and/or the musicians/singers physically being at the performance sites.. :<. I think that I recall 5th Harmony's performance from 2016-2017 NYRE being similarly pre-recorded a while in advance (like 1-2+ weeks prior), so I guess that the practice isn't totally unexpected and probably has been like that for a while..",

He goes out of his ways to mention quirky/interesting things he remembers about certain idols on the show so that they don't feel too burdened - and you can see the idols being thankful when he does stuff like this. I've also seen him talking 1 on 1 to BLACKPINK's Jennie in the background during their KB episode in all smiles - he just seems really amiable. It was also nice that he kept mentioning Jisoo on Knowing Bros. only after meeting her once during their Inkigayo MC week.\n\n**Other Mentions:**\n\n* Fuckng Seungri is friends with everyone - he's the Gatsby version of Heechul. He also goes out of his ways to make friends - whether you agree to it or not. Seungri will befriend you and act like he's known you for years lmao. Year-end shows are his fav. things because he can e-x-p-o-s-e all the shy ones in the industry - like he did to Seohyun and Sehun in 2 consecutive years and then followed it with BTS next year.\n* Hyuna, Sunmi and Heize, though shy and seniors in the industry are always warm and friendly towards juniors and want to get close to them.

Her and Taeyeon seem extremely close these days as well. And ofc she's really friendly with all of soshi as well as all her other label mates. For boy groups I always knew her and N were still quite friendly from their music core MC days but she was also seen being really friendly with Seventeen's Dino too. She even seemed quite friendly with Jessi from a couple times they promoted together. \n\nOh yeah and addition to celebrities she seems to also just have a lot of friends in industry which allows for things like: doing a informal photoshoot at her photographer friend's house, and somehow landing a producing and lyricist role on the album of one of her indie artist friends. She seems to have a very attractive easy going personality. Very impressive for someone so young.",

Nayeon is close with Seulgi. Overall, Twice know all the Red Velvet dances, and they said they wished to have a meal with the Red Velvet members in the future.  \n  \n- **Gfriend** : Sana is really close to Eunha, and Dahyun is really close to SinB since Weekly idol. Dahyun even stayed with Gfriend at the end of a show while Twice already joined the backstage, she was literally glued with SinB because they couldn't see each other for a while. Nayeon is close with Yerin aswell.  \n  \n- **Pristin** : Dahyun is really close with Kyulkyung, probably thanks to Somi introducing them IOI.  \n  \n- **WJSN** : I don't think Twice and WJSN are that close, but Jungyeon knows Bona enough to hug her when they see each other. Also Tzuyu could talk with the chinese members of WJSN during ISAC.  \n \n- **Wanna One** : During P101, Twice showed a lot of support for Daehwi since he used to be a JYPE trainee. So we didn't get much interactions between both groups, but Twice-Daehwi must be friends at some degree. \n  \n- **Fromis_9** : Jiwon and Chaeyoung used to be JYPE trainees. And Jiwon was in Sixteen along with Twice, they're really good friends, and they kinda teared up seeing each other after so much time during Idol School.  \n  \n- **JYP Artists** : there aren't that much public interactions between the girls and other artists from JYPE (probably to avoid any scandals), but some members are probably close with GOT7. Also, Twice in general is still really close to Sunmi, even tho she left JYPE. (She knows them enough to backhug the members playfully, and Twice often offers to Sunmi to tag along with them when she's alone at the shows ending etc). Yeeun wrote Only You for Twice. Hyerim composed Look At Me for Twice. Jihyo has a cute brother-sister relationship with the 2PM members since they know each other since she's 8-9 years old.  \n  \n- **Monsta X** : Dahyun and Jooheon are friends, and used to do performances together because they went to the same church. Their interactions are really minimal, but Jooheon isn't that shy and doesn't hesitate to offer Dahyun a simple highfive when they come across each other.",

He also befriended Sleepy during Law of the Jungle and they seem to keep in touch regularly (Sleepy is the one who suggested RM to BigHit).  \n\n**Suga** is the most intriguing to me. He has these really unexpected friendships that make us wonder \"How?\". He is close to Zhoumi (has the code to his apartment), Heechul (Heechul sent a wreath to his parents' restaurant opening), Tablo (Tablo has posted some of their chats on twitter), Suran, Monsta X Kihyun (Suga sent Monsta X a wreath for their latest showcase), Kim Shin Young (was also at the [WINGS tour final](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcjsf8Gg56W/), thanked Suga for inviting her, has also talked about them on her [radio show](https://www.soompi.com/2017/07/23/kim-shin-young-explains-bts-left-great-impression/)) and I'm probably forgetting more. He's not really too open about his private friendships so it's always a trip to hear about them from the other side.  \n\n**J-Hope** has his dance academy friends (B.A.P. Zelo, EXID Hyelin, Bigstar  Sunghak), and surprisingly SuJu Ryeowook (J-Hope and his sister attended his musical, and Ryeowook attended the HYYH Epilogue concert). He's also spent time with Ravi.  \n\n**Jimin** has the Taemin/Kai/Sungwoon/Timoteo crew. And Eunkwang.  \n\n**V**... this could take awhile lol. He seems to be the most social and outgoing member. He has his friends he met in bathrooms (Moonbok in high school, Sungjae, Park Kyung), Kim Minjae (watch their Celebrity Bromance episodes, so cute), his Hwarang hyungs (SHINee Minho, Park Seojoon, Park Hyungsik, Do Jihan), Park Bogum (they've gone on [vacation together](https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/853958596194848768), Bogum was also at the [final WINGS tour](https://twitter.com/Soulmate__0613/status/939456596240867328) fanboying with an [ARMY bomb](https://youtu.be/BMjz8BJdmrY?t=54s) and screaming at V lol), Ha Jiwon (they've posted pics eating [brunch together](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZLx9mrn1Fv/), she also went to the [WINGS tour final show](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bci2A3IHhgx/), etc). Seojoon and Hyungsik were with V for his[ birthday](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdX6iTch18Z/) a few days ago, and were also at the WINGS tour ([here's a tweet from after the show with Hyungsik, Seojoon, Bogum, Ha Jiwon and SNSD Yoona](https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/940152036082860034) who I guess is another addition to his circle of friends, truly a successful fanboy since the first album he bought was SNSD Gee). I'm probably forgetting a ton of people but this is already getting long.  \n\n**Jungkook** is a very shy kid, but he has started to make some friends lately, as part of the 97-line group (GOT7 BamBam and Yugyeom, Seventeen Mingyu, DK, and The8, and NCT Jaehyun). Hongbin also mentioned playing Overwatch with Jungkook, Suga and V.",

Just looking at MoonMoon, it took influential celebrities promoting him back up to charts, and then getting recognition by light public listening to top of the charts.).

LOONA\n\nI'm trying to be a little \"fairer\", in the sense of putting down groups that have released lots of high quality songs and have a large discography over my personal favourites. That said, I do have a few questions regarding the rules. Thanks in advance for answering them! \n\n> The Top Tens of 2017 will be limited to Korean language music and music made by Korean artists, Japanese/Chinese/English releases by Korean artists will be eligible.\n\nCould I clarify if this means any song, as long as its made by a Korean artist in 2017, is eligible, even if its not in Korean? Because the way the sentence is structured seems (at least to me, or my terrible comprehension) that non-Korean language music would be ineligible.\n\n> LOONA and the rule: Solo and Subunit songs are eligible IF they appear on one of the full group albums\n\nJust to clarify, this rule would be relaxed if LOONA is chosen, given that I don't think LOONA has a full group album yet right?\n\nPS: I really^really^really^really^really^really^really hope OMG and FTIsland get selected",

Sherlock has always been my favorite SHINee song but seeing it performed live _really_ solidified it as my favorite SHINee track. Feel very blessed to have seen them.\n* EXO'rdium: Never understood why people got so worked up about Kai until seeing him live! He really has such an energy that I never noticed until I saw him perform with my own two eyes in front of me. He's really energetic and charismatic on stage. Also, I'm never going to forget how Chanyeol and D.O. played around with an owl mask LOL, that was so funny. It was a lot of stress pre-concert and a lot of interesting stuff before then, but once inside it was a fun time!\n* Korea Times Music Festival: so good! I mainly went for Tiffany but I also really liked APink's and VICTON's performances! Tiffany performing City of Stars though, aghhhhhh. It was so good!\n* Bumsan Milk Bar fanmeet with Sunny! I feel incredibly lucky to have gotten to go to that mini fanmeet she held and to see one of my favorite members from my ult group in person! It really was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I know she's around in L.A. now but to meet Sunny and interact with her was so amazing. And she gave everyone a hand-signed card and a rose! She was so sweet. I probably looked like an idiot when it was my turn to greet her and receive a card from her but I'm honestly super glad I got to go to that, it's easily one of my favorite things to happen in 2017.\n\nHere's to more fun experiences for me and everyone else in 2018!",

I bought those tickets as a birthday present from my sister. \n\nI decided Taemin would be my “bias” because Press Your Number was beautiful and I teased my sister by saying I didn’t care for the other members. \n\nThen I saw them perform and *holy shit* they were amazing. Taemin was as incredible as ever, Onew’s vocals were like warm caramel, Minho looked like a true god, and Key’s charm brightened the stage. But the true stunner for me was Jonghyun. He completely owned the stage and I couldn’t keep my eyes off of him. \n\nKeep in mind I didn’t know any SHINee members other than Taemin and I remember yelling in my sister’s ear asking about him. \n\nWhen I got home, I immediately searched SHINee (and Jonghyun) videos and binge watched them for hours. It was also the impetus for me to get more deeply into Kpop. \n\nAfter what happened, I thank god that I bought my sister those tickets. Sometimes I regret it; perhaps it wouldn’t have hurt so much if I hadn’t fallen so deeply for their (and *his*) charm at that concert. \n\nBut you know, I think SHINee is worth it.",

He was trying to read out what my shirt said (it basically was nonsense English letters since I had just bought it in Seoul). I realized he was talking to me and explained it to him and he started laughing, and Hakyeon (N) next to him was smirking the whole time (also staring at my chest lol). Thank you nonsense Seoul shirt for giving me a moment of conversation with Ken!!\n\nAlso, I didn't see any celebs, but I went to Cube's 20 Space cafe and it was glorious! They were playing BTOB, Pentagon, and CLC MVs projected onto the wall and it was just really cool to be there in that moment.",

In soundcheck it was so chaotic and vicious, so me and my two friend just stood to the back a bit and watched form afar, which im glad we did because v walked down the stage isle and gave us a wave! the concert was really good too, just hk and mainland army are so vicious hhhh also i didnt get acknowledged by my ultimate bias Namjoon but thats okay, always a reason to go again ;-) they were so great ahhh\n* Sep - A really big month for me! I signed up for a chance to have a dance lesson with Minzy, and i was random selected!! With the minzy of 2ne1! there were 20 of us but it was so unreal! Then I also was accepted to do her flashmob with her, i was in the front 2 rows to rights from her it still feel like a dream!! then they gave all performers 2 free tickets to go see her and myteens joint concert! I didnt know myteen well apart from listennting to their album beforehand but the concert was really great! and they gave everyone free hightouch too! really cool experience wow i felt so blessed\n* Sep - Nov - one of the most stresfull months of my life. I was scouted by FNC entertainemnt through the minzy thing and they asked me to sumbit a email application for their global audition as they were stopping by HK. My dance video actually got accepted!! and they invited me to the private audition! they gave me like 2 days warning which kinda sucked, so i wasent that confident and ended up not singing which ruined my chances lol but it was such a good opportunity which i thought i'd never get. Im still confused why they chose me because im not Asian, but i guess ill never find out lol\n* Dec - my boyfriend became a Pledis trainee. wow. hes leaving to Korea this summer and i still cant believe it\n    i think thats it. sorry for the atrocious spelling and multiple explanation marks it was a busy year\n(plus i regret not going to see SHINee so much :-( i was tempted but i was like 'eh ill see them next time....:-( sucks man, also same thing with EXO, it was one of their last concert as a 9, so much regrettt)",

SW was the first kpop concert I've always wanted to experience since getting into it in 2010, and to have experienced it in a small way after so many years made me so happy! And also in light of recent events, it almost felt like it was meant to happen...amazing night nonetheless.\n\n-Day6 Live and Meet in Austin! - oh boy, I was totally gunning for P1 in this but ended up getting only P2. I still got to meet the boys though! It was an interesting experience lining up since morning with fellow MyDays, and the 2 hour concert honestly slipped by so fast I didn't realize it was all done! I didn't know it was possible to fall for a group anymore but Day6 did that. Jae was right all this while y'all, they KILL it live. I so regret not being able to attend any of their concerts in KR after that :/ I could turn this into a mini fanacc but I'll spare you the details hehe",

It was everything and I’m so grateful I went to see them. \n\nBTS Wings tour in Anaheim. This was also really fun. They put on a hell of a show. \n\nKARD fanmeet in Houston. This was super cool because the venue was so small, which made it feel super intimate. I don’t love the whole fanmeet thing, I much prefer actual concerts, but this was really fun. \n\nSMTOWN in Hong Kong. This was everything I wanted and more. Only complaint: f(x), SNSD, and BoA were all absent. But this was my first time seeing EXO and NCT and they were all so damn good. NCT 127 blew it out of the water. And EXO was really good. I wish they could’ve had longer sets. Luna was incredibly good (no surprise there). RV was really good and I was really excited to see them perform their recent stuff. This was my last time seeing SHINee and they killed it, as always.\n\nTaeyeon in Seoul. I really wanted to see Jonghyun’s solo concerts in early December because I love his solo stuff (much more than Taeyeon’s, but I love her too), but I couldn’t make it work with my schedule. So much regret for not saying fuck it and going. Anyway, because I couldn’t go to Jonghyun’s concerts and Taeyeon’s concerts lined up perfectly with my winter break, I decided to go see Taeyeon. I did it through the SM global package, so I got to go to SMTOWN Coex Artium, which was really interesting, especially since this was only days after Jonghyun died. The amount of love for him all over the building was astounding and made me really happy. The actual concert itself was so good. Taeyeon is an amazing performer and even though I don’t love all her music, she held my attention for the full concert. No regrets, it was so good.",
