The foods tested in the FDA’s recent analysis were collected from the Total , which monitors levels of nutrients and contaminants in foods consumed in the U.S. from the agency’s most recent analysis of 94 samples of a variety of food products collected in FY2020 from the TDS found only one sample of cod to have detectable levels of two types of PFAS – perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). The FDA has determined that the PFAS levels found in the cod sample do not present a human health concern. “The FDA’s work in this space is critically important to advance science and fill knowledge gaps about these chemicals and their occurrence in food. We’re committed to using all tools available to help ensure the food we consume is safe and doesn’t risk anyone’s health,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. When there are detectable levels of a chemical contaminant, including PFAS, in food, the FDA conducts a safety assessment using the best available current science to evaluate whether the levels present a possible human health concern. The FDA’s approach considers a number of factors, including whether there is an established action level or tolerance, how much of the specific food people typically eat, the level of the contaminant detected in that food and the toxicity of the specific contaminant(s). As part of the FDA’s ongoing effort to use the to assess the safety of exposure to PFAS from foods, the agency monitors the scientific literature and available toxicological reference values, which are compared to the estimated dietary exposure to determine the potential health concern. We update the toxicological reference values we use in our evaluations as warranted. “The U.S. food supply is among the safest in the world, and the available scientific evidence does not support avoiding particular foods because of concerns regarding PFAS exposure,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “Since we began testing foods from the general food supply for PFAS in 2019, only four samples out of the nearly 300 tested have had detectable levels of PFAS and none have been determined to be at levels of concern for human health. The FDA remains committed to sharing further updates as our work in this important space progresses.” The foods tested in the FDA’s recent analysis represent a range of foods that are in the general food supply and are chosen to be representative of the major components of the average U.S. diet, based on national food consumption survey data. The samples were not specifically collected from areas of known environmental PFAS contamination. The agency tested the samples as part of our broader effort to better understand the occurrence of PFAS in foods, determine if targeted sampling assignments are necessary to better understand occurrence in certain food categories and help inform the overall agency’s approach to future surveillance efforts. The results released today are similar to results found in our previous analyses, which showed most TDS samples do not have detectable levels of PFAS, with the exception of the cod sample in this testing and from previous testing, two tilapia and one ground turkey sample. To better understand occurrence of PFAS in seafood, we are conducting a targeted survey of the most commonly consumed seafood in the U.S., including both cod and tilapia. The results from this survey will be used to determine if additional sampling, with greater numbers of samples of seafood, is needed."},

To date a total of four batches of Janssen drug substance that were manufactured at the Emergent facility have been authorized. The FDA conducted a thorough review of facility records and the results of quality testing performed by the manufacturer. Based on this review and considering the current COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA has concluded that these batches are suitable for use. While the FDA is not yet ready to include the Emergent BioSolutions plant in the Janssen EUA as an authorized manufacturing facility, the agency continues to work through issues there with Janssen and Emergent BioSolutions management. On June 30, the FDA issued an updated Letter to stating that the FDA no longer authorizes use of non-NIOSH-approved or decontaminated disposable respirators. The FDA has revoked the Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for non-NIOSH-approved disposable respirators (revocation effective July 6, 2021) and the EUAs for decontamination and bioburden reduction systems (revocation effective June 30, 2021). As of the effective date of the , these devices are no longer authorized for use by health care personnel in health care settings. These actions are in follow-up to the May 27, 2021, letter in which the FDA recommended a transition away from non-NIOSH-approved disposable respirators as well as from reusing decontaminated or bioburden-reduced disposable respirators. Testing updates: As of today, 393 tests and sample collection devices are authorized by the FDA under emergency use authorizations (EUAs). These include 281 molecular tests and sample collection devices, 84 antibody and other immune response tests and 28 antigen tests. There are 52 molecular authorizations and one antibody authorization that can be used with home-collected samples.

Today’s actions are consistent with the . They are also consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) recently published to protect health care workers, which requires health care employers to provide NIOSH-approved or FDA-authorized respirators for workers potentially exposed to COVID-19. All manufacturers of decontamination and bioburden reduction systems have requested, and the FDA has proceeded with, the revocation of their EUAs, effective June 30, 2021. Since the beginning of the pandemic, NIOSH has approved more than 875 respirator models or configurations, with some of these manufactured by approximately 20 new, domestic NIOSH-approval holders. In addition, as of today, there are more than 6,400 total respirator models or configurations on the NIOSH-certified equipment list which have met the NIOSH-approved EUA criteria and thus are FDA-authorized. These include: Today’s EUA revocations announcement for all non-NIOSH approved disposable FFRs follows earlier actions to limit authorization of FDA has also withdrawn two related decontamination and bioburden reduction guidance documents: The FDA recommends health care personnel transition from extended use of disposable respirators to single-use for single-patient interactions as appropriate.

{"title": "FDA Approves Component of Treatment Regimen for Most Common Childhood Cancer", "date": "June 30, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Rylaze (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn) as a component of a chemotherapy regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma in adult and pediatric patients who are allergic to the E. coli-derived asparaginase products used most commonly for treatment. The only other FDA-approved drug for such patients with allergic reactions has been in global shortage for years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs in approximately 5,700 patients annually, about half of whom are children. It is the most common type of childhood cancer. One component of the chemotherapy regimen is an enzyme called asparaginase that kills cancer cells by depriving them of substances needed to survive. An estimated 20% of patients are allergic to the standard E. coli-derived asparaginase and need an alternative their bodies can tolerate. Rylaze’s efficacy was evaluated in a study of 102 patients who either had a hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginases or experienced silent inactivation. The main measurement was whether patients achieved and maintained a certain level of asparaginase activity. The study found that the recommended dosage would provide the target level of asparaginase activity in 94% of patients. The most common side effects of Rylaze include hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatic toxicity, blood clots, hemorrhage and liver toxicity. This review was conducted under , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners. For this review, FDA collaborated with Health Canada, where the application review is pending. Rylaze received designations for this indication. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need. Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Rylaze to Jazz Pharmaceuticals."},
{"title": "FDA Releases Cyclospora Prevention, Response and Research Action Plan", "date": "July 01, 2021", "contents": " As part of our ongoing efforts to combat foodborne illness and aligned with our New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative, today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released the . Modeled after our Leafy Greens Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) Action Plan, the plan focuses on improving prevention, enhancing response activities and filling knowledge gaps in order to help prevent Cyclospora contamination of foods and to help prepare for responding to future outbreaks. Cyclosporiasis is a foodborne intestinal illness caused by Cyclospora cayetanensis. The most common symptoms of cyclosporiasis are diarrhea, weight loss, nausea and fatigue. Cyclospora is historically associated with imported produce or travel outside the U.S.; however, we have also detected Cyclospora in domestically produced foods in recent years. The FDA first documented Cyclospora in domestically grown produce (cilantro) in 2018 as part of an ongoing of fresh herbs. The testing was done as part of a surveillance sampling, and the cilantro sample was not linked to any illnesses or outbreaks. Not long after, domestically grown produce was again associated with an linked to a salad mix. During the FDA’s investigations into this outbreak, Cyclospora was also detected in an unused package of the salad containing domestically grown produce. The availability of for Cyclospora developed at the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition played an important role in helping the FDA identify these positive samples of Cyclospora in the cilantro and in the salad mix. The number of reported cases of this foodborne illness has been rising in recent years, in part because of better diagnostic and detection methods. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been roughly 6,000 domestically acquired cases of Cyclospora over the last three years. The number of reported cases typically rises during the spring and summer, usually in May, June and July. Rising case numbers and the emergence of Cyclospora contamination in domestically grown produce prompted the FDA to create the Cyclospora Task Force in 2019. The task force is comprised of multidisciplinary experts across the FDA and CDC, with the goal of reducing the public health burden of foodborne illness caused by Cyclospora in produce. The task force formulated the action plan announced today, which will serve as a strategic guide to improve prevention, enhance response activities and fill knowledge gaps about the presence of Cyclospora in or on foods. In the area of prevention, the new action plan highlights how we’re addressing this food safety issue through the development and delivery of prevention-focused education materials and outreach to stakeholders. We’re also working with industry to encourage the development of rapid test kits to specifically detect Cyclospora to better facilitate industry testing and root cause analysis activities. In addition, we plan to collaborate with industry to look for ways to more effectively control Cyclospora in the environment and on farms. In the area of response, the plan is focused on expanding laboratory capacity across the FDA, state, foreign partners and academia to sample and test for Cyclospora, providing greater capacity to investigate during outbreak events. The FDA is also developing a new investigational tool to help guide assessments of farms potentially implicated in a Cyclospora outbreak to determine potential sources and routes of contamination. Given the emerging nature of Cyclospora contamination in domestic produce, a large number of action items in this plan are aimed at addressing knowledge gaps. In this area, the FDA intends to work with CDC to better understand the case distribution of cyclosporiasis across the U.S. and to advance genotyping methods in clinical, food and environmental samples that will allow us to genetically link clinical cases to food products and environments identified by traceback during an outbreak. As part of this plan, the FDA also intends to work with industry and academia to better understand the prevalence of Cyclospora in agricultural water and to encourage data sharing to help stakeholders identify trends associated with Cyclospora contamination. Our action plan underscores the importance of collaboration across industry, academia, state, federal and foreign government partners, and other stakeholders to reduce the risks and public health burden caused by foodborne Cyclospora. We’ll continue updating this plan as actions are completed and new actions are identified. While the U.S. has one of the safest food supplies in the world, we are focused on making it better. The FDA is focused on working with all stakeholders to achieve the goals identified in this Cyclospora Prevention, Response and Research action plan."},

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Drug for Treatment of COVID-19", "date": "June 24, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an for the drug Actemra (tocilizumab) for the treatment of hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Actemra is not authorized for use in outpatients with COVID-19. In clinical trials of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, Actemra in addition to the routine care patients receive for treatment of COVID-19, which included corticosteroid therapy, was shown to reduce the risk of death through 28 days of follow-up and decrease the amount of time patients remained hospitalized. The risk of patients being placed on ventilators or death through 28 days of follow-up was also decreased. Actemra is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by blocking the interleukin-6 receptor. In the case of COVID-19 infection, the immune system can become hyperactive, which may result in worsening of disease. Actemra does not directly target SARS-COV-2. Actemra is a prescription medication given by intravenous infusion that is FDA-approved for multiple inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Under today’s EUA, the FDA is authorizing the emergency use of Actemra for the treatment of certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Actemra is not approved as a treatment for COVID-19. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that Actemra may be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized population. And, when used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits of Actemra outweigh the known and potential risks for the drug. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to Actemra for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age or older) who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. The data supporting this EUA for Actemra are based on four clinical trials. These included one randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial [Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY)] and three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (EMPACTA, COVACTA and REMDACTA). While all four clinical trials contribute to the FDA’s understanding of Actemra for the treatment of COVID-19, the most important scientific evidence on the potential benefit of Actemra for its authorized use came from the RECOVERY and EMPACTA trials. In the RECOVERY trial, 4,116 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to receive either Actemra in addition to usual care (2,022 patients) or usual care alone (2,094 patients). The primary endpoint evaluated death through 28 days of follow-up, and the results of the primary analysis were statistically significant. The probabilities of death by day 28 were estimated to be 30.7% for patients receiving Actemra and 34.9% for patients receiving usual care alone. The median time to hospital discharge was 19 days for patients receiving Actemra and more than 28 days for patients receiving usual care alone. In the EMPACTA trial, 389 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to receive Actemra (249 patients) or placebo (128 patients). The primary endpoint evaluated the need for mechanical ventilation or death through 28 days of follow-up. For patients receiving Actemra, there was an observed reduction in progression to mechanical ventilation or death compared to patients who received placebo, with the primary analysis results being statistically significant. The proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation or died by day 28 was estimated to be 12.0% for patients receiving Actemra and 19.3% for patients receiving placebo. In the COVACTA trial, 452 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to receive Actemra (294 patients) or placebo (144 patients). The primary endpoint was clinical status through 28 days of follow-up assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale. While there was no statistically significant difference observed in clinical status on the 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 between treatment groups, the COVACTA trial contributed to the assessment of the safety for Actemra when used for the treatment of COVID-19. In the REMDACTA trial, 649 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to receive Actemra in combination with remdesivir (430 patients) or placebo in combination with remdesivir (210 patients). The primary endpoint was time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” through 28 days of follow-up. Additionally, while there were no statistically significant differences observed between treatment groups with respect to time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” through 28 days of follow-up, the REMDACTA trial contributed to the assessment of the safety for Actemra when used for the treatment of COVID-19. Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using Actemra in treating COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to . These fact sheets include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Common side effects of Actemra observed in the COVID-19 trials include constipation, anxiety, diarrhea, insomnia, hypertension and nausea. The EUA was issued to Genentech Inc."},

For each vaccine, the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) has been revised to include a warning about myocarditis and pericarditis and the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers has been revised to include information about myocarditis and pericarditis. This update follows an extensive review of information and the discussion by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday. The data presented at this meeting reinforced the FDA’s decision to revise the fact sheets and further informed the specific revisions. The warning in the Fact Sheets for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccines notes that reports of adverse events suggest increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly following the second dose and with onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination. Additionally, the Fact Sheets for Recipients and Caregivers for these vaccines note that vaccine recipients should seek medical attention right away if they have chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination. The FDA and CDC are monitoring the reports, collecting more information, and will follow-up to assess longer-term outcomes over several months. Today, the FDA a supplement to the 2015 safety communication on reprocessed flexible bronchoscopes, reminding health care facilities to follow manufacturer instructions for reprocessing and device maintenance, and providing a new recommendation for health care providers on single-use bronchoscopes. The goal of the recommendations is to reduce potential infection transmission between patients. This communication also includes updated information on medical device adverse event reports. The FDA reached a milestone of approving 1,000 original and supplemental generic drug applications to help in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research prioritized the review of generic drug applications for potential treatments and supportive therapies for patients with COVID-19, such as antibiotics, sedatives used in ventilated patients, anticoagulants, and pulmonary medications. Reaching this milestone during the COVID-19 pandemic further supports the FDA’s everyday mission of improving access to safe, high-quality treatment options, which can result in more competition in the market and more affordable medicines for Americans.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use in Adolescents in Another Important Action in Fight Against Pandemic", "date": "May 10, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age. The FDA amended the EUA originally issued on Dec. 11, 2020 for administration in individuals 16 years of age and older. “The FDA’s expansion of the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “Today’s action allows for a younger population to be protected from COVID-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic. Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations.” From March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021, approximately 1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years of age have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Children and adolescents generally have a milder COVID-19 disease course as compared to adults. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart, the same dosage and dosing regimen for 16 years of age and older. The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria to amend the EUA, and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in this population. “Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our evaluation and decision-making process, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that the available data meet our rigorous standards to support the emergency use of this vaccine in the adolescent population 12 years of age and older.” The FDA has updated the with information to reflect the use of the vaccine in the adolescent population, including the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The EUA amendment for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The issuance of an EUA is not an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance or to protect public health or safety. The available safety data to support the EUA in adolescents down to 12 years of age, include 2,260 participants ages 12 through 15 years old enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the United States. Of these, 1,131 adolescent participants received the vaccine and 1,129 received a saline placebo. More than half of the participants were followed for safety for at least two months following the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects in the adolescent clinical trial participants, which typically lasted 1-3 days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, chills, muscle pain, fever and joint pain. With the exception of pain at the injection site, more adolescents reported these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. The side effects in adolescents were consistent with those reported in clinical trial participants 16 years of age and older. It is important to note that as a general matter, while some individuals experience side effects following any vaccination, not every individual’s experience will be the same and some people may not experience side effects. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should not be given to anyone with a known history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis—to any component of the vaccine. Since its authorization for emergency use, rare severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in some recipients. The effectiveness data to support the EUA in adolescents down to 12 years of age is based on immunogenicity and an analysis of COVID-19 cases. The immune response to the vaccine in 190 participants, 12 through 15 years of age, was compared to the immune response of 170 participants, 16 through 25 years of age. In this analysis, the immune response of adolescents was non-inferior to (at least as good as) the immune response of the older participants. An analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring among participants, 12 through 15 years of age, seven days after the second dose was also conducted. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, no cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,005 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 978 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19. At this time, there are limited data to address whether the vaccine can prevent transmission of the virus from person to person. In addition, at this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection. As part of the original EUA request, Pfizer Inc. submitted a plan to continue monitoring the safety of the vaccine as it is used under EUA. This plan has been updated to include the newly authorized adolescent population, and includes longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials, as well as other activities aimed at monitoring the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death."},

In particular, our inspection, surveillance and compliance activities were significantly impacted,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “The FDA fully understands the importance of getting back to a more consistent state of inspectional capacity. This plan provides the public with a transparent picture of both the successes and challenges we’ve faced in these areas over the past year, as well as our plan moving forward. We want to assure the American public that we have used a variety of tools to oversee the regulated industry and ensure that Americans continue to have access to safe food and high-quality FDA-regulated products.” In March 2020, the FDA that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections, while continuing mission critical inspections when possible. Beginning the week of July 20, 2020, the FDA began to work toward resuming prioritized domestic inspections using its . The report outlines inspections that the agency was unable to complete during the past year due to travel restrictions or inability to ensure the safety of our workforce or the workforces the agency regulates. The report also outlines the number of mission-critical inspections the agency completed during that time, such as inspections of facilities for which there was a drug shortage, inspections needed for the approval of novel drugs or drugs related to the potential treatment of COVID-19, support of pre-market and pre-license applications and response to foodborne disease outbreaks or other food safety risks such as undeclared allergens. Among other things, the report highlights: Additionally, the report outlines the FDA’s continued successful use of alternative tools and approaches where inspections were or are not currently feasible, including remote interactive evaluations (e.g., remote livestreaming video of operations, teleconferences or screen sharing), record requests and leveraging information from trusted regulatory partners. For example, over 1,300 record requests have been made to human and animal drug and biologic drug manufacturers that have led to a high level of regulatory decision actions. The report further outlines the ongoing steps the agency is taking in order to resume standard operational levels of inspection activities, including how it intends to prioritize domestic and foreign inspections that were not performed during the pandemic. The plan highlights a variety of possible scenarios given the continued uncertainty of the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic. Inspections considered critical to the FDA’s mission will remain the primary focus. When planning routine surveillance inspections, the agency will prioritize higher-risk establishments. Therefore, a longer interval between inspections will occur for the less high-risk facilities as the FDA adjusts to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that postponed inspections will be prioritized based on risk and conducted over a longer period of time, ultimately increasing the amount of time between inspections of certain lower-risk facilities. The agency will also soon begin a multi-year modernization effort to further transform our data enterprise platforms and cross-program interoperability infrastructure to better support innovation related to its regulatory oversight role, including remote approaches. This modernization effort will include a review of inspectional approaches using next-generation assessment technologies and improvements. The FDA is also establishing an agency-wide FDA Inspectional Affairs Council that will plan and coordinate inspectional activities. The agency intends to share more information on these efforts as this work progresses. The FDA will continue to leverage and maximize every available tool and resource to meet its inspectional responsibilities, while achieving optimal public health outcomes. From March 2020 through March 2021, the FDA conducted a total of 821 mission-critical inspections, including 29 in foreign countries. Additionally, the agency conducted a total of 777 prioritized domestic inspections since resumption of that work in July 2020. Of the more than 13,500 applications for medical product approval or authorization received since March 2020, an estimated 68 applications have been delayed due to the inability to conduct inspections — and a majority of those are not deemed mission critical."},

{"title": "FDA Approves Immunotherapy for Endometrial Cancer with Specific Biomarker", "date": "April 22, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Jemperli (dostarlimab) for treating patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and whose cancers have a specific genetic feature known as dMMR (which contain abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell), as determined by an FDA-approved test. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States and its prevalence is increasing. Approximately 75% of endometrial cancers are diagnosed at an early stage and are typically curable with surgery. However, women with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer have limited therapeutic options following front-line standard treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapeutic regimen. Approximately 25% to 30% of patients with advanced endometrial cancer have dMMR tumors. Jemperli works by targeting the cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1 (proteins found on the body’s immune cells and some cancer cells). Jemperli helps the body’s immune system in its fight against cancer cells by blocking this pathway. The safety and efficacy of Jemperli was studied in a single-arm, multi-cohort clinical trial. Of the 71 patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer who received Jemperli in the trial, 42.3% had a complete response (disappearance of tumor) or a partial response (shrinkage of tumor) to treatment with Jemperli. For 93% of responders, the response lasted for six months or more. Common side effects of Jemperli include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anemia and constipation. Jemperli can cause serious conditions known as immune-mediated side effects, including inflammation of healthy organs such as the lungs (pneumonitis), colon (colitis), liver (hepatitis), endocrine glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis). Patients who experience severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions should stop taking Jemperli. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Jemperli because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The safety and effectiveness of Jemperli in pediatric patients are not known. Jemperli received designation and designation for this indication. Priority Review designation directs overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Jemperli was approved for this new indication using the pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials may be required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Jemperli and the sponsor is currently conducting these trials in additional patients with dMMR endometrial tumors.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of Device to Facilitate Muscle Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients", "date": "April 23, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new device indicated for use in patients 18 and older undergoing stroke rehabilitation to facilitate muscle re-education and for maintaining or increasing range of motion. The Neurolutions IpsiHand Upper Extremity Rehabilitation System (IpsiHand System) is a Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) device that assists in rehabilitation for stroke patients with upper extremity—or hand, wrist and arm—disability. A stroke occurs when normal blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Brain cells obtain oxygen and nutrients from regular blood circulation, so when there is a blockage of blood flow to the brain caused by a clot (an ischemic stroke) or excessive bleeding in the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel (a hemorrhagic stroke), the brain cells can die from a lack of blood and oxygen. Although stroke is a brain disease, it can affect the entire body and sometimes causes long-term disability such as complete paralysis of one side of the body (hemiplegia) or one-sided weakness (hemiparesis) of the body. Stroke survivors may have problems with the simplest of daily activities, including speaking, walking, dressing, eating and using the bathroom. According to the , someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds. About 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. The IpsiHand System uses non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes instead of using an implanted electrode or other invasive feature to record brain activity. The EEG data is then wirelessly conveyed to a tablet for analysis of the intended muscle movement (intended motor function) and a signal is sent to a wireless electronic hand brace, which in turn moves the patient’s hand. The device aims to help stroke patients improve grasping. The device is prescription-only and may be used as part of rehabilitation therapy. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the IpsiHand System device through clinical data submitted by the company, including an unblinded study of 40 patients over a 12-week trial. All participants demonstrated motor function improvement with the device over the trial. Adverse events reported included minor fatigue and discomfort and temporary skin redness. The IpsiHand System device should not be used by patients with severe spasticity or rigid contractures in the wrist and/or fingers that would prevent the electronic hand brace from being properly fit or positioned for use or those with skull defects due to craniotomy or craniectomy. The IpsiHand System device was granted designation, which is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The FDA reviewed the IpsiHand System device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Neurolutions IpsiHand Upper Extremity Rehabilitation System to Neurolutions, Inc.

During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The two agencies have determined the following: CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed. “Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner. “Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.” Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision. Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the , reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2. On April 13, the FDA and CDC that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination. The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines. Reports of adverse events following vaccination can be made to the Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States. The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk. Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine."},
{"title": "FDA Launches Challenge to Spur Development of Affordable Traceability Tools as Part of Broader Food Safety Efforts", "date": "June 01, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched a challenge to spur the development of affordable, tech-enabled traceability tools to help protect people and animals from contaminated foods by enabling the rapid identification of their sources and helping remove them from the marketplace as quickly as possible. advances a goal set forth in the , released in July 2020, to encourage the development of creative financial models for low- to no-cost traceability solutions that would enable food producers of all sizes to participate in a scalable, cost-effective way. Tech-enabled traceability is one of the foundational core elements of the New Era initiative. However, affordability can be a barrier to the adoption of tech-enabled traceability systems, especially for smaller companies. “Too many Americans suffer from foodborne illnesses every year. Making the food supply more digitally enabled and food more traceable will speed the response to outbreaks and deepen our understanding of what causes them and how to prevent them from happening again,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “One of the FDA’s highest priorities is protecting consumers from foodborne illnesses. We hope to find new, innovative ways to encourage firms of all sizes to voluntarily adopt tracing technologies that can help our nation modernize the way we work together to determine possible sources of foodborne illnesses as quickly as possible to keep Americans safe.” Through this challenge, the agency is asking food technology solution providers, public health advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators across the human and animal food supply chain to present food traceability solutions that utilize economic models that are affordable, with costs that are proportional to the benefits received and can scale to encourage widespread adoption. “Having digital information easily accessible is a key priority of the FDA’s New Era of Smarter Food Safety. Through this initiative, we are committed to helping ensure that even small companies can use and benefit from new tracing technologies,” said Frank Yiannas, deputy FDA commissioner for food policy and response. “Digitizing data at no- or low-cost through the use of creative financial models allows the entire food system to get smarter together.” The challenge invites submissions for tech-enabled solutions that address the traceability needs and challenges unique to one or more segments of the human and animal food supply chain: To provide maximum flexibility, participants may offer solutions that are based on new or innovative models that are affordable for smaller enterprises. However, the solutions can also be based on existing or new scalable and cost-effective hardware, software or data analytics platforms. The FDA will accept submissions from June 1 through July 30 and intends to announce up to 12 winners at the end of the challenge. A panel of judges from the federal government with experience in the fields of technology, public health or the food industry will select the winners based on how well solutions meet specific traceability challenges and demonstrate innovation, usability, affordability, scalability and interoperability. No cash prizes will be awarded, but the winners will have the opportunity to present their work publicly in a webinar planned for September and their videos will be posted for public viewing. The challenge is being overseen by the FDA’s Office of Food Policy and Response and administered by as part of the .

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of Diagnostic Aid for Autism Spectrum Disorder ", "date": "June 02, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a device to help diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid is a machine learning-based software intended to help health care providers diagnose ASD in children 18 months through 5 years of age who exhibit potential symptoms of the disorder. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ASD as a “developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges” and . Because ASD symptoms can vary greatly, the disorder may be difficult to diagnose. While ASD may be detected as early as 18 months old, many children are not diagnosed until later in childhood, which can delay treatment and early intervention. The average age of diagnosis for ASD is 4.3 years. Some delays in diagnosis are due to the need for children to be referred to specialists with expertise in ASD. The Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid is a software as a medical device that uses a machine learning algorithm to receive input from parents or caregivers, video analysts and health care providers to assist physicians evaluate a patient at risk of ASD. The device consists of three main components: a mobile app for caregivers and parents to answer questions about behavior problems and to upload videos of their child; a video analysis portal that allows manufacturer-trained and certified specialists to view and analyze uploaded videos of patients; and a health care provider portal that is intended for a health care provider to enter answers to pre-loaded questions about behavior problems, track the information provided by parents or caregivers and review a report of the results. After processing the information provided by parents, caregivers and healthcare providers, the ASD Diagnosis Aid reports a positive or negative diagnosis if there is sufficient information for its algorithm to make a diagnosis. If there is insufficient information to render a “Positive for ASD” or “Negative for ASD” result to help determine a diagnosis, the ASD Diagnosis Aid will report that no result can be generated. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid in a study of 425 patients aged 18 months through 5 years in 14 different clinical care sites, with an average age of 2.8 years. The study compared the assessments made by the device directly against the assessments made by a panel of clinical experts who used the current standard ASD diagnostic process. The device provided a “Positive for ASD” or “Negative for ASD” result to aid in making a diagnosis in 32% of patients. For those with a “Positive for ASD” or “Negative for ASD” result, the device results matched the panel’s conclusions for 81% of patients who tested positive for ASD by the device and 98% of patients who tested negative for ASD by the device. In addition, the device made an accurate ASD determination in 98.4% of patients with the condition and in 78.9% of patients without the condition. The risks associated with the use of the device include misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of ASD, based on a false positive result (observed in 15 out of 303 study subjects without ASD), a false negative result (observed in one out of 122 study subjects with ASD) or when no result was generated. Both misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis can result in delayed treatment of ASD and delivery of treatment not appropriate for ASD. The FDA reviewed the Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid through the , a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of ASD for patients 18 months through 5 years of age who are at risk of developmental delay based on concerns of a parent, caregiver, or health care provider. The device is not indicated for use as a stand-alone diagnostic device but as an adjunct to the diagnostic process. The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Cognoa, Inc."},

Medtronic is stopping the distribution and sale of the HVAD System and has issued an requesting physicians to stop new implants of the device. This action comes after the company received over 100 complaints involving delay or failure to restart of the HVAD pump, including reports of 14 patient deaths and 13 cases where an explant was necessary. According to Medtronic, there are approximately 2,000 patients in the U.S. implanted with the device and 4,000 worldwide. The FDA is advising health care providers to follow the instructions provided in the Medtronic Notification Letter, including stopping new implants of the Medtronic HVAD System; using an alternative, such as the Abbott ; and advising patients who have the HVAD System to continue normal use of device components and to contact the company for replacement items, such as controllers, batteries, AC/DC adapters and carrying case. In addition, Medtronic’s Notification Letter states that providers should inform patients that elective device explant is not recommended, and decisions about removing the HVAD pump should be made on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration of the patient’s clinical condition and surgical risks. The Medtronic HVAD System was first approved for commercial use in the U.S. in November 2012. It is currently approved as a bridge to heart transplantation in patients who are at risk of death from end-stage left ventricular heart failure, for heart tissue recovery and as destination therapy in patients for whom a heart transplant is not planned. At the time of approval, the HVAD System was compared to another commercially approved left ventricular assist device, and it was determined that the data supported that the probable benefits of the HVAD System outweighed the probable risks. The device is used to treat patients with end-stage heart failure who have not responded to medical management, and the approved HVAD System labeling includes a list of all possible risks associated with the device. Medtronic’s decision to stop the sale and distribution of the HVAD follows the company’s of a subset of the HVAD pumps in December 2020. The FDA will continue to monitor adverse events associated with the HVAD System and keep health care providers and the public informed as new or additional information becomes available.

Ashley, J.D., Director of the Office of Compliance for FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is finalizing two guidance documents and making available two draft guidance documents to help ensure that prescription drugs are identified and traced properly as they move through the supply chain. These guidance documents lay out the FDA’s recommendations for how to comply with applicable DSCSA requirements, including those for enhanced drug distribution security at the package level that go into effect in November 2023. As part of the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers are required to put a product identifier on drug packages. This includes the product national drug code (NDC), serial number, lot number and expiration date on each package and homogenous case of product, in human- and machine-readable form. The machine-readable form is generally a two-dimensional data matrix barcode. Industry questions are clarified in the final guidance, Additionally, the final guidance is intended to aid certain trading partners in identifying a suspect product and specific scenarios that could significantly increase the risk of a suspect product entering the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. The guidance also describes how trading partners should notify the FDA of illegitimate product and sets forth a process for terminating notifications of illegitimate product in consultation with the FDA. In addition, this guidance describes when manufacturers should notify the FDA of a high risk that a product is illegitimate. This guidance responds to comments from stakeholders to clarify certain points and finalizes the remaining draft portion of the otherwise final guidance for industry, Drug Supply Chain Security Act Implementation: Identification of Suspect Product and Notification issued in December 2016. The revised draft guidance, , lays out the FDA’s current understanding of terms used to define “suspect” and “illegitimate” products. These include “counterfeit,” “diverted,” “stolen,” “fraudulent transaction” and “unfit for distribution.” In response to comments received from stakeholders, this draft guidance revises the March 2018 draft guidance. The new draft guidance, , is intended to assist supply chain stakeholders, particularly trading partners, with requirements for enhanced drug distribution security at the package level that go into effect on November 27, 2023.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Drug Treatment for Chronic Weight Management, First Since 2014", "date": "June 04, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy (semaglutide) injection (2.4 mg once weekly) for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related condition (such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol), for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. This under-the-skin injection is the first approved drug for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight since 2014. The drug is indicated for chronic weight management in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 or greater who have at least one weight-related ailment or in patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Approximately 70% of American adults have obesity or overweight. Having obesity or overweight is a serious health issue associated with some leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, and is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Losing 5% to 10% of body weight through diet and exercise has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in adult patients with obesity or overweight. Wegovy works by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that targets areas of the brain that regulate appetite and food intake. The medication dose must be increased gradually over 16 to 20 weeks to 2.4 mg once weekly to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Wegovy should not be used in combination with other semaglutide-containing products, other GLP-1 receptor agonists, or other products intended for weight loss, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal products. Wegovy has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Wegovy’s safety and efficacy were studied in four 68-week trials. Three were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (including 16 weeks of dose increases) and one was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial in which patients receiving Wegovy either continued with the treatment or switched to a placebo. More than 2,600 patients received Wegovy for up to 68 weeks in these four studies and more than 1,500 patients received placebo. The largest placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults without diabetes. The average age at the start of the trial was 46 years and 74% of patients were female. The average body weight was 231 pounds (105 kg) and average BMI was 38 kg/m2. Individuals who received Wegovy lost an average of 12.4% of their initial body weight compared to individuals who received placebo. Another trial enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes. The average age was 55 years and 51% were female. The average body weight was 220 pounds (100 kg) and average BMI was 36 kg/m2. In this trial, individuals who received Wegovy lost 6.2% of their initial body weight compared to those who received placebo. The most common side effects of Wegovy include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal (stomach) pain, headache, fatigue, dyspepsia (indigestion), dizziness, abdominal distension, eructation (belching), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in patients with type 2 diabetes, flatulence (gas buildup), gastroenteritis (an intestinal infection) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (a type of digestive disorder). The prescribing information for Wegovy contains a boxed warning to inform healthcare professionals and patients about the potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. Wegovy should not be used in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with a rare condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Wegovy should not be used in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to semaglutide or any of the other components of Wegovy. Patients should stop Wegovy immediately and seek medical help if a severe allergic reaction is suspected. Wegovy also contains warnings for inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), gallbladder problems (including gallstones), low blood sugar, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy (damage to the eye's retina), increased heart rate and suicidal behavior or thinking. Patients should discuss with their healthcare professional if they have symptoms of pancreatitis or gallstones. If Wegovy is used with insulin or a substance that causes insulin secretion, patients should speak to their health care provider about potentially lowering the dose of insulin or the insulin-inducing drug to reduce the risk of low blood sugar. Healthcare providers should monitor patients with kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy and depression or suicidal behaviors or thoughts. The FDA granted the approval to Novo Nordisk. Semaglutide 1 mg injection (Ozempic) was first approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in 2017."},

The agency is announcing today that it is authorizing for use, under the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, two batches of vaccine drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore. Before making this decision, the FDA conducted a of facility records and the results of quality testing performed by the manufacturer. Based on this review and considering the current COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA concluded these batches are suitable for use. While the FDA is not yet ready to include the Emergent BioSolutions plant in the Janssen EUA as an authorized manufacturing facility, the agency continues to work through issues there with Janssen and Emergent BioSolutions management. The FDA’s decision to include these two batches of vaccine drug substance in the EUA for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine means that Janssen vaccine made with this drug substance can be used in the U.S. or exported to other countries. A condition on any export of these batches, or of vaccine manufactured from these batches, is that Janssen and Emergent agree that the FDA may share relevant information about the manufacture of the batches under an appropriate confidentiality agreement, with the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the vaccine may be used. The FDA has also revised the letter of authorization for the Janssen vaccine to help facilitate potential export to other countries. Under the revised letter of authorization, the distribution and administration of exported vaccines must comply with the laws of the recipient countries. The FDA has determined several other batches are not suitable for use, but additional batches are still under review and the agency will keep the public informed as those reviews are completed.

{"title": "FDA In Brief: FDA Issues Draft Guidance on Remanufacturing and Discussion Paper Seeking Feedback on Cybersecurity Servicing of Medical Devices", "date": "June 17, 2021", "contents": " The following quote is attributed to William Maisel, M.D., director of the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality in FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Additional Information: Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a draft guidance entitled to help clarify whether activities performed on devices are likely remanufacturing. This draft guidance also includes recommendations for information that should be included in labeling to help assure the continued quality, safety and effectiveness of devices that are intended to be serviced over their useful life. The FDA considered objective evidence and information learned from the agency’s activities discussed in this draft guidance, including a 2016 public workshop and docket for public comment and a 2018 FDA-authored white paper, public docket and public workshop on the topic. The FDA will begin accepting comments from the public on the draft guidance on June 18, 2021, and will be holding a webinar in the weeks following issuance of the draft guidance to allow industry to learn more about the draft guidance and ask questions of FDA subject matter experts on this topic. The FDA is also issuing a outlining cybersecurity challenges and opportunities associated with the servicing of medical devices. Stakeholders are invited to submit comments on the issues raised in the document to help address the challenges related to medical device servicing in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks for patients. The discussion paper highlights the need for stakeholders to collaborate to develop strategies and other approaches that may enable servicers to play a key role in preventing and mitigating device vulnerabilities while maintaining device safety and effectiveness. The paper specifically discusses known challenges such as ensuring that only authorized parties have access to devices and related systems, as well as legacy devices containing operating systems and third-party software components that may no longer be supported and are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. The paper then discusses potential opportunities where these product life cycle challenges may be mitigated, for example, by implementing and deploying validated software in a timely manner in response to emerging cybersecurity vulnerabilities to keep a product within acceptable performance specifications."},
{"title": "FDA Approves StrataGraft for the Treatment of Adults with Thermal Burns", "date": "June 15, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved StrataGraft for the treatment of adult patients with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements (remaining deep skin layers) for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (also referred to as deep partial thickness burns). Thermal burns are typically caused by direct contact with an external heat source such as steam, scalding water, hot surfaces or fire. “Serious burns can be an incredibly difficult injury to treat and can adversely affect more than just the skin. The goal of burn management is to help the patient return to the highest level of functionality and independence possible, while improving the overall quality of life,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “This approval provides health care professionals a novel way to treat burn wounds.” For many deep burns, treatment frequently involves the removal of the damaged, burned skin and replacement with a skin graft. Skin grafts are often the patient’s own healthy skin taken from their body and moved to the burned area to help it heal. This procedure, called an autograft, leaves a new wound where the healthy skin was removed. StrataGraft is produced from two kinds of human skin cells (keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts) grown together to make a bi-layered construct (a cellularized scaffold). StrataGraft is for topical application, placed onto the burn by a healthcare provider. Over time, the patient’s skin cells should grow to replace the skin cells lost as a result of the burn. Treatment with StrataGraft can help avoid or decrease the amount of healthy skin that is needed for grafting. The effectiveness and safety of StrataGraft are based on two randomized clinical studies involving a total of 101 adult patients with deep partial thickness thermal burns. In both studies, two deep partial-thickness burn wounds of comparable area and depth on each patient were identified and randomized to receive either a single topical application of StrataGraft or autograft. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the percentage of StrataGraft treatment sites that achieved a complete wound closure, and the significantly decreased need for autografts at the StrataGraft treatment sites. Common side effects reported by patients who received StrataGraft in clinical studies were pruritus (itching), blisters, hypertrophic scar, and impaired healing (stalled healing process) at the treatment site. Overall, the safety profile of StrataGraft regarding wound related events, included erythema (redness), swelling, local warmth and wound site infections, was similar to that of autografting in these studies. There were no reports of rejection of StrataGraft in the clinical studies. The FDA granted StrataGraft regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT), Priority Review and Orphan Drug designations for this indication. StrataGraft was developed in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Since the human keratinocyte cells were grown with mouse cells during initial stages of product development, StrataGraft is formally considered to be a xenotransplantation product (involving tissues or cells belonging to different species). Mouse cells are no longer used in the final manufacturing process. Due to StrataGraft containing cells from human donors and animal-derived materials, and because animal cells were used in early stages of product development, there is a risk of transmission of infectious diseases or agents although at this time transmission of infectious diseases or agents by StrataGraft has not been reported. The FDA granted approval to Stratatech, a Mallinckrodt company."},

{"title": "FDA Takes Action For Failure to Submit Required Clinical Trial Results Information to ClinicalTrials.Gov", "date": "April 28, 2021", "contents": " Being transparent about the results of completed clinical trials enables important advances in the development of medical products and helps ensure a safe, effective and efficient clinical research enterprise. Across all types of medical product trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration works with responsible parties to encourage compliance with the requirements to submit registration and summary results information to the data bank, managed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Library of Medicine. Sponsors of clinical trials may represent a variety of organizations, including academic institutions, hospitals, private companies and government research organizations, or could be individual researchers. Federal law requires that responsible parties, typically trial sponsors, register applicable clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov within 21 days after the first human subject is enrolled and submit certain summary results information for those trials, generally no later than one year after the study’s completion date unless a deadline extension is obtained. The FDA makes determinations about whether responsible parties are complying with legal requirements for submitting information to ClinicalTrials.gov for applicable clinical trials. These statutory and regulatory requirements are intended to provide greater transparency regarding clinical trials, ultimately allowing the broader scientific community to build on the information submitted. The submission to and posting of clinical trial information on ClinicalTrials.gov honors volunteers who participate in research to advance medical science and enhances public trust by creating a transparent and robust public record of clinical trials and information about their results. When these legal requirements are not met, the FDA has the authority to take enforcement action. The agency has previously outlined its to identifying whether responsible parties have failed to submit required registration and/or summary results information to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank for applicable clinical trials studying drug products, biological products and device products. Although many responsible parties comply with the law without FDA action, the agency has sent Pre-Notices of Noncompliance (more than 40 to date) to encourage voluntary compliance with the ClinicalTrials.gov requirements. The FDA has determined that a responsible party who received a Pre-Notice of Noncompliance has not complied with its legal reporting obligations. Accordingly, today, the FDA issued its first (Acceleron) for failing to submit required summary results information to ClinicalTrials.gov. The company’s evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the drug dalantercept in combination with axitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The Notice of Noncompliance gives Acceleron 30 days to submit the required summary results information. The FDA is authorized to seek civil money penalties for Acceleron’s violation, including additional civil money penalties if Acceleron fails to submit the required information within the 30-day period. The Notice of Noncompliance has also been posted to the FDA’s website and information about the noncompliance will be posted on the study record on ClinicalTrials.gov by NIH. NIH will continue to update the ClinicalTrials.gov records for applicable clinical trials that are the subject of a Notice of Noncompliance with information regarding whether the noncompliance has been corrected and the amount of civil money penalties assessed, if any. The FDA takes its role in enforcing the ClinicalTrials.gov registration and results information submission requirements extremely seriously and we will continue to encourage voluntary compliance with these requirements. When necessary, the FDA will take appropriate actions to help ensure that required information is available on ClinicalTrials.gov as required by law and for the benefit of clinical trial participants and public health."},
{"title": "La FDA se compromete a tomar medidas basadas en la evidencia dirigidas a salvar vidas y prevenir futuras generaciones de fumadores ", "date": "April 29, 2021", "contents": " Hoy, la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los EE.UU. (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) anunció que se compromete a avanzar en el desarrollo de dos normas para productos del tabaco y reducir significativamente las enfermedades y muertes causadas por el uso de productos del tabaco de combustión, la principal causa de muertes evitables en los EE.UU. La FDA está trabajando para emitir propuestas de normas para productos de tabaco el próximo año que prohibirán el mentol como un sabor característico en los cigarrillos, y prohibirán todos los sabores característicos (incluido el mentol) en los cigarrillos. La autoridad para adoptar normas para productos es una de las herramientas para la regulación del tabaco más poderosas que el Congreso le ha dado a la agencia. Esta decisión se basa en datos científicos claros y en pruebas que demuestran el carácter adictivo y perjudicial de estos productos, y se basa en importantes medidas anteriores que prohibieron otros cigarrillos con sabores en 2009. La agencia está tomando medidas urgentes para reducir la adicción al tabaquismo y evitar muertes. Existen pruebas sólidas de que la prohibición del mentol ayudará a las personas a dejar de fumar. Los estudios demuestran que el mentol aumenta la atracción al tabaco y facilita la progresión para ser un fumador regular, especialmente entre los jóvenes y los adultos jóvenes. El mentol oculta los sabores desagradables y la dureza de los productos del tabaco, lo que hace que sea más fácil empezar a consumirlos. Los productos del tabaco con mentol también pueden ser más adictivos y más difíciles de dejar al potenciar los efectos de la nicotina. Un (en inglés) sugiere que la prohibición de los cigarrillos mentolados en los EE.UU. llevaría a que 923,000 fumadores más dejaran de fumar, entre ellos 230,000 afroamericanos, en los primeros 13 a 17 meses tras la entrada en vigor de la prohibición. Un anterior estimó que se evitarían unas 633,000 muertes, entre ellas unas 237,000 de afroamericanos. Si se implementan estas normas, la autoridad de la FDA de cualquier prohibición de los cigarrillos mentolados y de todos los cigarros con sabores sólo se dirigirá a los fabricantes, distribuidores, mayoristas, importadores y minoristas. La FDA no puede y no hará cumplir la prohibición contra la posesión o el uso de cigarrillos mentolados o de cualquier producto del tabaco por parte de los consumidores individuales. La FDA trabajará para asegurarse de que ningún producto del tabaco ilegal llegue al mercado. Estas medidas son una oportunidad importante para lograr beneficios significativos en materia de salud pública y avanzar hacia la equidad en la salud. La FDA está trabajando rápidamente en estas dos cuestiones, y el siguiente paso será la publicación de las normas propuestas en el Registro Federal, dando así la oportunidad de recibir comentarios del público. La agencia también reconoce la importancia de garantizar un acceso amplio y equitativo a todas las herramientas y recursos que pueden ayudar a los fumadores actualmente adictos que quieren dejar de fumar, incluidos los que fuman cigarrillos mentolados y que se verían afectados por estas medidas de salud pública. La FDA trabajará con sus socios de otras agencias federales para asegurarse de que quienes intentan dejar de fumar cuentan con el apoyo necesario. Los fumadores interesados en dejar de fumar hoy deben visitar en español o llamar al 1-800-QUIT-NOW para informarse sobre los servicios para dejar de fumar disponibles en su estado. La FDA también sigue enfocada en su supervisión reglamentaria de los cigarrillos electrónicos y otros sistemas electrónicos de suministro de nicotina (ENDS, por sus siglas en inglés). El Centro de Productos del Tabaco recientemente (en inglés) de su trabajo en curso para llevar a cabo la revisión previa a la comercialización de los ENDS y otras aplicaciones de productos del tabaco, y ha emitido cartas de advertencia a los fabricantes de productos ENDS y a los minoristas que siguen vendiendo productos que están en el mercado ilegalmente. La FDA también ha realizado una importante inversión en una campaña multimedia de educación pública sobre los cigarrillos electrónicos. La campaña está dirigida a casi 10.7 millones de jóvenes de entre 12 y 17 años que han usado alguna vez cigarrillos electrónicos o están dispuestos a probarlos, y destaca la información sobre los riesgos potenciales del uso de los cigarrillos electrónicos. Hoy, la FDA aceptó una petición ciudadana que solicitaba que la agencia siguiera adelante con la elaboración de normas para prohibir el mentol en los cigarrillos, afirmando su compromiso de proponer dicha norma de producto. La Ley de Control del Tabaco (TCA, por sus siglas en inglés) de 2009 no incluyó el mentol en su prohibición de los sabores característicos en los cigarrillos, dejando a los cigarrillos mentolados como los únicos cigarrillos de combustión con sabor que aún se comercializan en los EE. UU. La ley encargó a la FDA que siguiera estudiando la cuestión del mentol en los cigarrillos. Desde entonces, la FDA ha solicitado la , tal y como exige el TCA,  y ha seguido demostrando su interés mediante la publicación de una (en inglés), la realización de una (en inglés), y el apoyo a esfuerzos de investigación más amplios; todo ello con el fin de comprender mejor las diferencias entre los cigarrillos mentolados y no mentolados, y el impacto del mentol en la salud de la población. Se calcula que en los EE.UU. hay casi 18.6 millones de fumadores actuales de cigarrillos mentolados. Pero el uso de cigarrillos mentolados entre los fumadores no es uniforme: de todos los fumadores afroamericanos, casi el 85% fuma cigarrillos mentolados, en comparación con el 30% de los fumadores de raza blanca que fuman mentolados. Además, entre los jóvenes, de 2011 a 2018, se observaron descensos en el uso de cigarrillos mentolados entre los jóvenes de raza blanca no hispanos, pero no entre los jóvenes afroamericanos no hispanos o los jóvenes hispanos. Después de la prohibición legal de 2009 de los sabores en los cigarrillos que no sean mentolados, el uso de los cigarrillos con sabores aumentó dramáticamente, lo que sugiere que los objetivos de salud pública de la prohibición de los cigarrillos con sabores pudieron haber sido perjudicados por la continua disponibilidad de estos cigarrillos con sabor. Los cigarrillos y cigarritos con sabores producidos en masa son productos del tabaco de combustión que pueden parecerse mucho a los cigarrillos, plantean muchos de los mismos problemas de salud pública y son desproporcionadamente populares entre los jóvenes y otras poblaciones. En 2020, los estudiantes de secundaria afroamericanos no hispanos declararon haber fumado cigarrillos en los últimos 30 días a niveles dos veces superiores a los de sus homólogos de raza blanca. Casi el 74% de los jóvenes de 12 a 17 años que consumen cigarrillos dicen que los fuman porque vienen en sabores que les gustan. Entre los jóvenes que han probado alguna vez un cigarro, el 68% de los usuarios de cigarritos y el 56% de los usuarios de cigarrillos con filtro afirman que su primer cigarro fue un producto con sabor. Además, en 2020, cada día más jóvenes probaron un cigarro en lugar de un cigarrillo."},
{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of First Device that Uses Artificial Intelligence to Help Detect Potential Signs of Colon Cancer", "date": "April 09, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of the GI Genius, the first device that uses artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning to assist clinicians in detecting lesions (such as polyps or suspected tumors) in the colon in real time during a colonoscopy. According to the National Institutes of Health, colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Colorectal cancer usually starts from polyps or other precancerous growths in the rectum or the colon (large intestine). As part of a colorectal cancer screening and surveillance plan, clinicians perform colonoscopies to detect changes or abnormalities in the lining of the colon and rectum. A colonoscopy involves threading an endoscope (thin, flexible tube with a camera at the end), through the rectum and throughout the entire length of the colon, allowing a clinician to see signs of cancer or precancerous lesions. The GI Genius is composed of hardware and software designed to highlight portions of the colon where the device detects a potential lesion. The software uses artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to identify regions of interest. During a colonoscopy, the GI Genius system generates markers, which look like green squares and are accompanied by a short, low-volume sound, and superimposes them on the video from the endoscope camera when it identifies a potential lesion. These signs signal to the clinician that further assessment may be needed, such as a closer visual inspection, tissue sampling, testing or removal, or ablation of (burning) the lesion. The GI Genius is designed to be compatible with many FDA-cleared standard video endoscopy systems. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the GI Genius through a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study in Italy with 700 subjects 40-80 years old who were undergoing a colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, surveillance, positive results from a previous fecal immunochemical (fecal occult blood) test for blood in the stool or gastrointestinal symptoms of possible colorectal cancer. The primary analyses from the study were based on a sub-population of 263 patients who were being screened or surveilled every 3 years or more. Study subjects underwent either white light standard colonoscopy with the GI Genius (136 patients) or standard white light colonoscopy alone (127 patients). The primary endpoint of the study compared how often colonoscopy plus GI Genius identified a patient with at least one lab-confirmed adenoma (precancerous tumor) or carcinoma (cancerous tumor) to how often standard colonoscopy made the same identifications. In the study, colonoscopy plus GI Genius was able to identify lab-confirmed adenomas or carcinomas in 55.1% of patients compared to identifying them in 42.0% of patients with standard colonoscopy, an observed difference of 13%. While use of this device led to more biopsies being performed, there were no adverse events reported with the additional biopsies, such as perforations, infections or bleeding. However, there was a slight increase in the number of lesions biopsied that were not adenomas. The GI Genius is not intended to characterize or classify a lesion, nor to replace lab sampling as a means of diagnosis. The device does not provide any diagnostic assessments of colorectal polyp pathology, nor does it suggest to the clinician how to manage suspicious polyps. GI Genius only identifies regions of the colon within the endoscope’s field of view where a colorectal polyp might be located, allowing for a more extended examination in real time during colonoscopy. It is up to the clinician to decide whether the identified region actually contains a suspected lesion, and how the lesion should be managed and processed per standard clinical practice and guidelines. The FDA reviewed the GI Genius through the , a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no legally marketed predicate device to which the device can claim substantial equivalence.

The agency approved Amondys 45 based on an increase in dystrophin (a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact) production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with the therapy. This is the first FDA-approved targeted treatment for patients with this type of mutation. Approximately 8% of patients with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of . DMD is caused by mutations in the that results in an absence of dystrophin, a protein found in muscle fiber. The first symptoms are usually seen between three and five years of age and worsen over time. DMD occurs in approximately one out of every 3,600 male infants worldwide; in rare cases, it can affect females. Amondys 45 was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 43 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous Amondys 45 (30 mg/kg) or placebo. All patients were male, between 7 and 20 years of age, and had a genetically confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. In the study, patients who received Amondys 45 showed a significantly greater increase in dystrophin protein levels from baseline to week 48 of treatment compared to those who received placebo. The FDA has concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 45 skipping. A clinical benefit of the drug, including improved motor function, has not been established. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease, and the lack of available therapy. The most common side effects observed in DMD patients treated with Amondys 45 were upper respiratory tract infections, cough, fever, headache, joint pain and throat pain. Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the Amondys 45 clinical studies, kidney toxicity was observed in the nonclinical studies. Kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking Amondys 45. Amondys 45 was approved using the pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Amondys 45, and the sponsor is currently conducting an ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Amondys 45 in ambulatory DMD patients. The FDA granted this application designations. Amondys 45 also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues Policies to Guide Medical Product Developers Addressing Virus Variants", "date": "February 22, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued guidances for medical product developers, specifically covering vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics products, to address the emergence and potential future emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. “The FDA is committed to identifying efficient ways to modify medical products that either are in the pipeline or have been authorized for emergency use to address emerging variants,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “We know the country is eager to return to a new normal and the emergence of the virus variants raises new concerns about the performance of these products. By issuing these guidances, we want the American public to know that we are using every tool in our toolbox to fight this pandemic, including pivoting as the virus adapts. We need to arm health care providers with the best available diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to fight this virus. We remain committed to getting these life-saving products to the frontlines.” The FDA has anticipated the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and has already been prepared to address changes in the virus, informed by the agency’s experience with evolving infectious diseases, such as influenza and HIV. While the FDA has already been communicating with individual medical product sponsors to provide information and scientific advice as they evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on their products, in the spirit of transparency and to continue to encourage public input on this important topic, the agency published this suite of guidances. As with any evolving situation, the FDA will be continuously monitoring the situation and updating its plans as more information becomes available. The agency is committed to communicating with the public as the FDA determines the best paths forward. The FDA urges Americans to continue to get tested, get their vaccines to prevent COVID-19 and follow important health measures—wash your hands, wear a mask and maintain social distance. The FDA updated its October 2020 guidance, , to provide recommendations to vaccine developers, including those who have already received emergency use authorization (EUA) for their COVID-19 vaccines and are seeking to amend their EUA to address new variants. At this time, available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, if there is an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) in the U.S. that are moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it may be necessary to tailor the vaccines to the variant(s). The updated guidance outlines the FDA’s scientific recommendations for modifications to authorized vaccines. For example, the FDA expects that manufacturing information will remain generally the same for an authorized vaccine and a modified vaccine candidate from the same manufacturer. For clinical data, the guidance recommends that a determination of effectiveness be supported by data from clinical immunogenicity studies, which would compare a recipient’s immune response to virus variants induced by the modified vaccine against the immune response to the authorized vaccine. Manufacturers are also encouraged to study the modified vaccine in both naïve (non-vaccinated) individuals and in individuals previously vaccinated with the authorized vaccine. Additionally, the guidance outlines the FDA’s recommendations for assessments of safety to support an EUA for a modified vaccine. Finally, the guidance states that further discussions will be necessary to decide whether in the future, modified COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized without the need for clinical studies. The FDA issued a new guidance for test developers, . The guidance provides information on evaluating the potential impact of emerging and future viral genetic mutations, which may be the basis of viral variants, on COVID-19 tests, including design considerations and ongoing monitoring. The FDA has already issued a safety alert to caution that the presence of viral genetic mutations in a patient sample can potentially change the performance of a diagnostic test. The FDA identified a few tests that are known to be impacted by emerging viral mutations, though at this time the impact does not appear to be significant. The clinical impact of viral genetic mutations on a test’s performance is influenced by various factors, such as the sequence of the variant, the design of test (for example, molecular tests designed to detect multiple SARS-CoV-2 genetic targets are less susceptible to the effects of genetic variation than tests designed to detect a single genetic target), and the prevalence of the variant in the patient population. The guidance describes the FDA’s activities to better understand the public health impact of new virus variants and the impact on test performance, such as monitoring publicly available genomic databases for emerging SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutations and monitoring the potential effects of genetic variation on molecular tests that have been issued an EUA. The guidance also provides recommendations to test developers, such as considering the potential for future viral genetic mutations when designing their test, and conducting their own routine monitoring to evaluate the potential impact of new and emerging viral genetic mutations, which may be the basis of viral variants, on the performance for molecular, antigen and serology SARS-CoV-2 tests. To address the impact of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of monoclonal antibody products targeting the virus, the FDA has issued a new guidance, . FDA has also revised a second guidance covering drugs and biological products more broadly for COVID-19, The new guidance provides recommendations for developers of SARS-CoV-2-targeting monoclonal antibodies during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses, like SARS-CoV-2. The FDA is aware that some of the monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized are less active against some of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged. This guidance provides recommendations on efficient approaches to the generation of non-clinical, clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls data that could potentially support an EUA for monoclonal antibody products that may be effective against emerging variants. The revised guidance covering drugs and biological products more broadly, originally published in May 2020, describes the FDA’s current recommendations regarding phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials for drugs and biological products under development to treat or prevent COVID-19, including the patient population, trial design, efficacy endpoints, safety considerations and the statistical considerations for such trials and more. Today, this guidance was updated to address the evolving landscape of COVID-19 drug development, including the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the availability of authorized COVID-19 vaccines. With these guidances, the FDA is encouraging developers of drugs or biological products targeting SARS-CoV-2 to continuously monitor genomic databases for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluate phenotypically any specific variants in the product target that are becoming prevalent or could potentially impact its activity.

{"title": "FDA Approves Drug to Reduce Bone Marrow Suppression Caused by Chemotherapy", "date": "February 12, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Cosela (trilaciclib) as the first therapy in its class to reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression in adults receiving certain types of chemotherapy for extensive-stage (when the cancer has spread beyond the lungs) small cell lung cancer. Cosela may help protect bone marrow cells from damage caused by chemotherapy by inhibiting cyclin- dependent kinase 4/6, a type of enzyme. Chemotherapy drugs are designed to kill cancer cells but can damage normal tissues as well. The bone marrow is particularly susceptible to chemotherapy damage. The bone marrow makes red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (small fragments in the blood) that transport oxygen, fight infection, and stop bleeding. When damaged, the bone marrow produces fewer of these cells, leading to fatigue, increased risk of infection, and bleeding, among other problems. Cosela may help protect the normal bone marrow cells from the harmful effects of chemotherapy. The effectiveness of Cosela was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Combined, these studies randomly assigned 245 patients to receive either an infusion of Cosela in their veins or a placebo before chemotherapy. The studies then compared the two groups for the proportion of patients with severe neutropenia (a very low count of white blood cells called neutrophils) and the duration of severe neutropenia in the first cycle of chemotherapy. In all three studies, patients who received Cosela had a lower chance of having severe neutropenia compared to patients who received a placebo. Among those who had severe neutropenia, patients who received Cosela, on average, had it for a shorter time than patients who received a placebo. The most common side effects of Cosela include fatigue; low levels of calcium, potassium and phosphate; increased levels of an enzyme called aspartate aminotransferase; headache; and infection in the lungs (pneumonia). Patients should also be advised about injection site reactions, acute drug hypersensitivity, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (lung tissue inflammation) and embryo-fetal toxicity. Cosela received FDA designations for the indication noted above. The FDA granted the approval of Cosela to G1 Therapeutics, Inc.

{"title": "FDA Approves First in the World, First-of-Its-Kind Implant for the Treatment of Rare Bone Disease as a Humanitarian Use Device", "date": "February 17, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Patient Specific Talus Spacer 3D-printed talus implant for humanitarian use. The Patient Specific Talus Spacer is the first in the world and first-of-its-kind implant to replace the talus—the bone in the ankle joint that connects the leg and the foot—for the treatment of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the ankle joint, a serious and progressive condition that causes the death of bone tissue stemming from a lack of blood supply to the area. The implant provides a joint-sparing alternative to other surgical interventions commonly used in late-stage AVN that may disable motion of the ankle joint. AVN is often caused by a sudden injury—such as a broken bone or a dislocated joint—or sustained damage to the tissue that develops over time, and it occurs when there is a lack of blood supply to bone tissue, causing it to become necrotic, meaning it dies. When the bones of a joint are affected, such as in the case of the ankle, the cartilage that keeps the bones from rubbing together can deteriorate, causing arthritis and pain. Late-stage AVN of the ankle may result in the talus bone partially or fully collapsing. Current available treatments include fusing the joints in the foot and ankle together—a procedure which helps to alleviate pain caused by AVN but eliminates motion in the joint—or below-the-knee amputation. The Patient Specific Talus Spacer is a 3D printed implant that can be used in talus replacement surgery. The talus spacer is made for each patient individually, modeled from computed tomography (CT) imaging, and is fitted to a patient’s specific anatomy. During the replacement surgery, the patient’s talus bone is removed and replaced with the implant, which is made from cobalt chromium alloy. While fusion may become necessary in the future should the condition worsen, talus replacement surgery with the Patient Specific Talus Spacer is intended to be a joint-sparing procedure, as it allows the patient to retain motion in the ankle joint. The FDA reviewed data for the Patient Specific Talus Spacer through the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) process. A (HUD) is a device that is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. Data supporting the safety and probable benefit of the Patient Specific Talus Spacer include results from 31 patients and 32 talus replacement surgeries (one patient had operations on both ankles) with the implant. At three years post-operation, the average reported pain decreased from “moderate to severe” prior to surgery to “mild” post-surgery, and average range of motion in the ankle joint also improved. These measures were assessed using standard subjective scoring systems for pain and functionality. By the three-year mark, out of 32 cases, there were three reported additional surgeries. The most common reported adverse events were pain and scar tissue at the surgery site. The FDA granted the HDE approval of the Patient Specific Talus Spacer to Additive Orthopaedics, LLC. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "COVID-19 Update: USDA, FDA Underscore Current Epidemiologic and Scientific Information Indicating No Transmission of COVID-19 Through Food or Food Packaging ", "date": "February 18, 2021", "contents": " After more than a year since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a global health emergency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to underscore that there is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Our confidence in the safety of the U.S. food supply remains steadfast. Consumers should be reassured that we continue to believe, based on our understanding of currently available reliable scientific information, and supported by overwhelming international scientific consensus, that the foods they eat and food packaging they touch are highly unlikely to spread SARS-CoV-2. It’s particularly important to note that COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread from person to person, unlike foodborne or gastrointestinal viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food. While there are relatively few reports of the virus being detected on food and packaging, most studies focus primarily on the detection of the virus’ genetic fingerprint rather than evidence of transmission of virus resulting in human infection. Given that the number of virus particles that could be theoretically picked up by touching a surface would be very small and the amount needed for infection via oral inhalation would be very high, the chances of infection by touching the surface of food packaging or eating food is considered to be extremely low. The USDA and the FDA are sharing this update based upon the best available information from scientific bodies across the globe, including a continued international consensus that the risk is exceedingly low for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans via food and food packaging. For example, a recent opinion from the , stated: “Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19.” Additional from other countries agree. In addition, considering the more than 100 million cases of COVID-19, we have not seen epidemiological evidence of food or food packaging as the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans. Furthermore, transmission has not been attributed to food products or packaging through national and international surveillance systems. Food business operations continue to produce a steady supply of safe food following current Good Manufacturing Practices and preventive controls, focusing on good hygiene practices and keeping workers safe. Based on the scientific information that continues to be made available over the course of the pandemic, the USDA and FDA continue to be confident in the safety of the food available to American consumers and exported to international customers.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of Novel Device to Help Protect Athletes’ Brains During Head Impacts", "date": "February 26, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new device intended to be worn around the neck of athletes aged 13 years and older during sports activities to aid in the protection of the brain from the effects associated with repetitive sub-concussive head impacts. The non-invasive device, called Q-Collar, is a C-shaped collar that applies compressive force to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce movement of the brain within the cranial space which may occur during head impacts. The device may reduce the occurrence of specific changes in the brain that are associated with brain injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be caused by a forceful bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body, or from an object that pierces the skull and enters the brain. Not all blows or jolts to the head result in a TBI. According to the , from 2006 to 2014, the number of TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths increased by 53%. Blunt trauma accidents, or accidents that involve being struck by or against an object, particularly sports-related injuries, are a major cause of TBI. The notes that anywhere from 1.6 million to 3.8 million sports- and recreation-related TBIs are estimated to occur in the United States annually. When worn around the neck during sports activities, the Q-Collar provides compressive force to the internal jugular veins, which in turn increases the blood volume in the skull’s blood vessels. Typically, when people experience blunt trauma accidents, the brain moves unrestrained in the skull, which is known as a “slosh.” The Q-Collar’s increase in blood volume in those blood vessels creates a tighter fit of the brain inside the skull and reduces the “slosh” movement. By reducing the movement of the brain within the cranial space, the Q-Collar may aid in the protection of the brain from the effects of head impacts. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Q-Collar through several studies, including a prospective, longitudinal study in the United States with 284 subjects 13 years or older who were participants on a high school football team. During the sports season, 139 athletes wore the Q-Collar and 145 athletes did not. All participants also wore an accelerometer device that measured every impact to the head sustained during play. Each athlete underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan pre-season and post-season. These MRI scans were used to generate Diffusion Tensor Imaging (a specialized MRI image) of the brain that allowed researchers to compare structural changes in the participants’ brain, after a season of play. Significant changes were found in deeper tissues of the brain involved in the transmission of electrical nerve signals (white matter regions) in 106 of the 145 (73%) participants in the no-Collar group, while no significant changes in these regions were found in 107 of the 139 (77%) of the group who wore the Q Collar. These differences appear to indicate protection of the brain associated with device use. No significant adverse events were associated with device use. The Q-Collar does not replace, and should be worn with, other protective sports equipment associated with specific sports activities, such as helmets and shoulder pads. Wearers of the device should not depend on the device to protect them from all harmful effects of head impacts. Users should take steps to avoid direct impact to the head and neck. Data do not demonstrate that the device can prevent concussion or serious head injury. The Q-Collar should not be used if an individual has not been medically cleared to play contact sports. The Q-Collar has not been tested and should not be used on athletes with the following conditions: The device can be worn for up to four hours at a time and should be replaced after two years of active use or upon the product’s expiration date listed on the package, whichever comes first. The Q-Collar is intended for over-the-counter use and will be distributed directly to consumers. However, a medical professional should be consulted if a user is unsure whether the Q-Collar is right for him or her. The FDA reviewed the device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.

Patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A experience severe and rapidly progressive neurologic damage including intractable seizures, feeding difficulties and muscle weakness from the accumulation of toxic sulfite metabolites in the central nervous system. Most patients die in early childhood from infections. Before today’s approval, the only treatment options included supportive care and therapies directed towards the complications arising from the disease. Patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A cannot produce a substance known as cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Nulibry is an intravenous medication that replaces the missing cPMP. The effectiveness of Nulibry for the treatment of Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A was demonstrated in 13 treated patients compared to 18 matched, untreated patients. The patients treated with Nulibry had a survival rate of 84% at three years, compared to 55% for the untreated patients. The most common side effects included complications related to the intravenous line, fever, respiratory infections, vomiting, gastroenteritis and diarrhea. Phototoxicity (injury to the skin and eyes from certain types of light, such as sunlight) was seen in animals, so patients treated with Nulibry should avoid exposure to sunlight and wear sunscreen, protective clothing, and sunglasses when exposed to the sun.

The alternative temperature for transportation and storage will help ease the burden of procuring ultra-low cold storage equipment for vaccination sites and should help to get vaccine to more sites,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Pfizer Inc. submitted data to the FDA to demonstrate that their COVID-19 vaccine remains stable after storage of the undiluted vials for up to two weeks at standard freezer temperature. The alternative temperature for storage of frozen vials is not applicable to the storage of thawed vials before dilution (which can be held in the refrigerator for up to 5 days), or on the storage of thawed vials after dilution (which can be held at refrigerator temperature or room temperature for use within 6 hours). The updated are intended to help frontline workers understand the new alternative transportation and storage temperatures. The Fact Sheets are available on the FDA website.

Additionally, the FDA issued several Warning Letters to certain firms offering unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized thermal imaging systems for sale. Thermal imaging systems intended to measure a person’s surface skin temperature are regulated as devices by the FDA. Thermal imaging systems detect infrared light emitted from a person’s skin and convert that information into a temperature reading. The FDA is aware that thermal imaging systems can be used as a way to detect temperature as part of a larger approach to COVID-19 risk management, such as in combination with mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing, to provide initial temperature assessments or triage individuals for elevated temperatures in public areas such as airports, grocery stores, offices and schools.  When designed and used correctly, thermal imaging systems have been shown to accurately measure someone’s surface skin temperature. Improper use of thermal imaging systems may lead to inaccurate body temperature measurements which can present potentially serious public health risks.  Such risks may include, but are not limited to, the device incorrectly detecting a normal human body temperature when a person has an elevated temperature and incorrectly assessing a person to have an elevated body temperature when they do not. These risks are more likely to be present where thermal imaging systems scan multiple individuals simultaneously. To help mitigate these risks, the FDA is providing important recommendations in the safety communication to consumers, health care providers and other users about the proper and improper use of these systems. The FDA is also aware that some firms are marketing unapproved, uncleared and unauthorized thermal imaging devices intended to measure human body temperature, including measuring multiple individuals’ temperatures simultaneously, and has issued Warning Letters to .The FDA’s position is that Warning Letters are issued only for violations of regulatory significance.

{"title": "FDA Announces New Actions Aimed at Further Reducing Toxic Elements in Food for Babies, Young Children ", "date": "March 05, 2021", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration takes exposure to toxic elements, such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead, in the food supply extremely seriously, especially when it comes to protecting the health and safety of the youngest and most vulnerable in the population. That is why today, we are announcing new actions aimed at further preventing or reducing chemical hazards that may be present in foods for babies and young children. First, today we issued a reminding manufacturers of these types of foods of their existing responsibilities related to these efforts. Secondly, the agency is announcing that we’ll soon be putting into action a plan aimed at reducing toxic elements in foods for babies and young children to levels as low as is reasonably achievable. As parents and caregivers ourselves, we recognize and understand concerns about toxic elements and how they could impact the health of children. We share the public’s concerns for the health of America’s children, and want to reassure parents and caregivers that at the levels we have found through , children are not at an immediate health risk from exposure to toxic elements in foods. The FDA routinely monitors levels of toxic elements in food, and if we find that they pose a health risk, the FDA takes steps to remove those foods from the market. Research has shown that reducing exposure to toxic elements is important to minimizing any potential long-term effects on the developing brains of infants and children. A report released last month by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform’s Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy also highlighted important questions on what more can be done to reduce toxic elements in baby food. The FDA issued a letter to manufacturers of foods for babies and young children covered by the preventive control provisions of the , as well as persons covered under other rules requiring a hazard analysis. The letter reminds them of their existing responsibility to consider risks from chemical hazards, including toxic elements, when conducting a hazard analysis, including for products for babies and young children. The preventive control provisions require industry to implement controls to significantly minimize or prevent any identified chemical hazards requiring a control. For example, some manufacturers may conduct verification activities like testing the final product. Ultimately, we want consumers to be reassured that manufacturers of foods for babies and young children have a legal responsibility under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure the safety of their products. To build on our ongoing work with regulated industry in this area, we intend to address the following areas: Our new activities will further efforts that the agency has continued to take in this area, including our work in 2020 to for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal. We’ll be working to develop additional action levels, finalize our on reducing inorganic arsenic in apple juice and publish a draft guidance that will establish action levels for lead in juices. These activities, along with an increase in sampling and reporting, will help continue to drive down levels of toxic elements in foods. It’s important to understand that toxic elements are present in the environment, including in our air, water and soil, and therefore are unavoidable in the general food supply. This is why another part of our plan is to ramp up availability of consumer information and resources that underscore how the key to a healthy diet including for infants and young children is variety. For example, the FDA has about the importance of feeding infants a variety of grain-based infant cereals. Rice cereal fortified with iron is a good source of nutrients for infants, but it shouldn’t be the only source and does not need to be the first one. The FDA does not recommend throwing out packaged foods for babies and young children or eliminating certain foods from children’s diets. The agency recommends that parents and caregivers speak with a pediatrician about a diet that includes a variety of age-appropriate healthy food in order to get needed nutrients. While not directly related, it’s also important to remind parents and caregivers not to make their own infant formula, as this has in infants that have suffered severe illness due to nutrient deficiencies and microbial foodborne illness. We’ll continue working with key stakeholders to develop messaging to provide important tips for parents and caregivers on developing varied and nutritious meal plans for babies and young children. Engaging stakeholders and our federal partners on issues such as developing and setting standards will help to identify impactful solutions for reducing toxic elements in foods commonly consumed by babies and young children. As such, we’ll also soon be announcing a public workshop to discuss the science surrounding levels of exposure that result in developmental impacts, and the foods that may contribute to those exposures, to identify solutions to protect our youngest consumers. The FDA is committed to reducing exposure to toxic elements in foods to the greatest extent feasible and to further advance progress in this area. We look forward to providing additional updates in the near future.

The T-Detect COVID Test is a next generation sequencing based (NGS) test to aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. The test analyzes DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequences from T cells (white blood cells) to aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A positive test result indicates recent or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, while a negative test result indicates that a patient is unlikely to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Negative results do not preclude acute or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. All results from the test should be used in combination with a clinical examination, patient medical history and other findings. The T-Detect COVID Test should not be used to diagnose current SARS-CoV-2 infection. A T cell response may be detected in blood several days after initial infection; however, it is unknown how long the T cell immune response remains following infection and what level of protection may be provided by the presence of a T cell immune response. The T-Detect COVID test will be a useful tool to help determine if a person previously had COVID-19. This is especially important for people who may have exhibited symptoms previously or believe they have been exposed but have not tested positive for COVID-19 using a molecular or antigen diagnostic test. The test is indicated for use by qualified healthcare professionals on samples from individuals who are 15 days or more post-symptom onset.

The authorized use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions. In a clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 at high risk for disease progression, a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together significantly reduced COVID-19-related hospitalization and death during 29 days of follow-up compared to placebo. The safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy for use in the treatment of COVID-19 continue to be evaluated. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. Treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab has not been studied in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab bind to different but overlapping sites on the spike protein of the virus. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together may be effective in treating certain patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. When used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits of these antibodies outweigh the known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the authorized population. The data supporting this EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab are based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 1,035 non-hospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms who were at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. Of these patients, 518 received a single infusion of bamlanivimab 2,800 milligrams and etesevimab 2,800 milligrams together, and 517 received placebo. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 related hospitalizations or death by any cause during 29 days of follow-up.  Hospitalization or death occurred in 36 (7%) patients who received placebo compared to 11 (2%) patients treated with bamlanivimab 2,800 milligrams and etesevimab 2,800 milligrams administered together, a 70% reduction. All 10 deaths (2%) deaths occurred in the placebo group. Thus, all-cause death was significantly lower in the bamlanivimab 2,800-milligram and etesevimab 2,800-milligram group than the placebo group. The authorized dosage of 700 milligrams bamlanivimab and 1400 milligrams etesevimab administered together is based on analyses of available preclinical, clinical, and virologic data, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, which, in totality, support that the authorized dosage is expected to have a similar clinical and virologic effect to 2,800 milligrams bamlanivimab and 2,800 milligrams etesevimab administered together. On Nov. 9, 2020, the FDA issued an for a single infusion of 700 mg bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and certain pediatric patients. While bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together resulted in a lower risk of resistant viruses developing during treatment compared with bamlanivimab administered alone, both treatments are expected to benefit patients at high risk of disease progression. At present, both 700 milligrams bamlanivimab alone as well as 700 milligrams bamlanivimab and 1,400 milligrams etesevimab administered together will be available under an EUA. Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in treating COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to . These fact sheets include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Serious and unexpected adverse events including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and infusion-related reactions have been observed with bamlanivimab with and without coadministration of etesevimab. In addition, clinical worsening following bamlanivimab administration has been reported, although it is not known if these events were related to bamlanivimab use or were due to progression of COVID-19. Possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together include nausea, dizziness, pruritus, and rash. The EUA was issued to Eli Lilly and Co.

The provides animal owners, veterinarians, researchers and the public with information on clinical field studies that are being investigated for the use of ACTPs in veterinary patients. We are offering this webpage as a resource because we’ve heard from veterinarians and pet owners who are eager to take part in clinical studies and avail their patients and pets of the potential that veterinary regenerative medicine may offer. Connecting interested pet owners and their veterinary teams with relevant clinical studies also helps sponsors in generating data toward potential FDA approval. Generally, the FDA regulates ACTPs as animal drugs if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease (e.g., osteoarthritis and tendon injuries in animals) in animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body (e.g., improving animal fertility) of animals. The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine provides regulatory oversight of clinical field studies for ACTPs, provides veterinary medical researchers with information to address scientific challenges and provides guidance on the regulatory process for their products. We also offer the to certain sponsors of ACTPs, which helps facilitate advancements in the development of innovative animal products by encouraging development and research, and supporting an efficient and predictable pathway to approval for these products. Clinical field study information on the webpage includes study name, species, condition, product type, recruitment period, study period, country or state and phone number and/or email address of the sponsor. Clinical field studies evaluating ACTPs are listed on the webpage when the sponsor has provided specific information to the FDA about the study and the sponsor consents to having their study information listed on the webpage. At the time of listing, the information is intended to disclose clinical field studies in support of product development and FDA approval. Participation is voluntary in clinical field studies for investigational ACTPs, and sponsors must voluntarily consent to having the FDA list their study information on the webpage. The studies listed on the webpage are investigational, and the ACTPs are not FDA-approved. This means the safety and effectiveness of the ACTP is not yet determined. The webpage will be updated with new clinical studies on a quarterly basis, and we expect the list of studies to grow. We welcome the opportunity to continue working with ACTP sponsors to discuss innovative approaches in developing treatments needed to support safe and effective animal therapies. Our ultimate objective is to obtain interpretable data from well-conducted, well-designed scientific studies. We look forward to working with individuals, universities and drug companies who develop this information and to gain a fuller understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with ACTPs. As scientists continue to research new and innovative therapies for animal health using animal cells and tissue, we encourage sponsors to develop the data needed to seek potential FDA-approval for their ACTPs. At the same time, we remain committed to taking action as necessary to protect public health against companies that illegally market ACTPs.

This week, the FDA added a new frequently asked question (FAQ), “Can the FDA help me get a COVID-19 vaccine,” to our . The answer is no. The FDA’s authority includes authorizing or approving COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States. The FDA is not responsible for vaccine distribution. Go to the to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. If you are contacted directly by someone who says they are from the FDA about a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, it is a scam. The FDA has added content to the question-and-answer appendix in its guidance titled “ .” The updated guidance includes a new question-and-answer regarding whether FDA considers receipt of medical products authorized under an emergency use authorization for use in clinical care, such as a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, or a monoclonal antibody to treat COVID-19, to be receipt of “investigational” medical products. This information may be relevant when sponsors are considering eligibility criteria that exclude patients from enrolling in clinical trials if they have received certain medical products. On Jan. 27, the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug application for , indicated for the treatment of edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease. Common side effects of furosemide injection include hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypotension (low blood pressure), and dizziness. This drug is included in the FDA’s Drug Shortage Database. The FDA recognizes the increased demand for certain products during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and we remain deeply committed to facilitating access to medical products to help address critical needs of the American public. The FDA updated the immediately in effect guidance: . The policy remains unchanged from the initial publication of this guidance; however, this update provides a minor clarification for one of the labeling recommendations.  Specifically, the revised guidance recommends that the labeling for devices modified as descried in the guidance include, in addition to other elements, a prominent and clear statement for users that results generated by the device are adjunctive (supporting) and should not be solely or primarily relied upon to diagnose or treat COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. As part of the FDA’s effort to protect consumers, the agency issued warning letters jointly with the Federal Trade Commission to , for selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims. The FDA placed all alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico on a to help prevent entry of violative and potentially dangerous products from entering the U.S. until the agency is able to review the product’s safety.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Continues Important Work to Support Medical Product Development to Address New Virus Variants", "date": "February 04, 2021", "contents": " As the public health agency responsible for regulating medical products, we must ensure that health care providers have the most up-to-date diagnostics, treatments and vaccines in their toolbox to fight this pandemic. We understand the need to adapt and pivot to support modification or development of these lifesaving tools as new variants of coronavirus are identified. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has anticipated the possible emergence of coronavirus variants. The FDA continues to monitor the identified and emerging variants circulating globally, as well as their detection in the U.S. We have been actively assessing the impact of new strains on authorized products and continue to work with medical product sponsors and our international partners to evaluate the impact that each variant may have on effectiveness or utility of authorized medical products. Our agency has had experience with evolving infectious diseases. Influenza vaccines and diagnostics are often modified each year to address the predicted predominant strains circulating globally. The agency has created and used regulatory processes that facilitate these updates. We will utilize our experience with influenza to help inform a path forward if SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge against which currently authorized vaccines are not sufficiently effective. Similarly, the FDA also has vast experience with HIV developing resistance to antiviral drugs and will follow regulatory pathways to quickly enable new antiviral drug development for resistant virus. We have already been communicating with individual medical product sponsors to provide information as they evaluate the impact of COVID-19 variants on their products. And as part of our commitment to a public and transparent process, the FDA is developing guidances for diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine developers to help guide ongoing medical product development. For therapeutics, particularly virus-targeting monoclonal antibodies, we are considering approaches to help expedite drug development in this key area, including discussing appropriate regulatory flexibilities. We are aware that some of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized or are under development are less effective against some of the COVID-19 variants that have emerged, and we are working with drug developers to accelerate the evaluation of new antibodies that could be effective against mutations. Relying on our growing experience with this class of drugs, our teams are discussing approaches to the generation and evaluation of pre-clinical, clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and controls data. For diagnostics, we have been monitoring for new mutations, identifying and working with developers of tests whose performance may be adversely impacted by them, and communicating with the public when helpful information becomes . At this time, we believe the risk that the currently known mutations will impact overall testing accuracy of molecular tests is low. Moving forward, we are considering expanding the role of in silico monitoring by sponsors prior to and following authorization to assess for mutations that impact the performance of the test, test designs to minimize the impact of new mutations and ways to label authorized products to be transparent about what we know the test can detect. For authorized vaccines, our teams are currently deliberating and discussing the types of data needed to support changes in the composition of the vaccine, either through altering the existing vaccine or through the addition of new vaccine component(s), including how sponsors could demonstrate immune response to new variants through streamlined clinical programs that still gather the crucial data the FDA needs to demonstrate effectiveness, but can be executed quickly to gather this data. To be clear, while we continue to develop an understanding of and address any impact of variants on FDA-regulated products, at this time, available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We believe these guidances will demonstrate our flexibility to work with individual sponsors to support their modification or development of products to fight COVID-19. The FDA’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an all-hands-on-deck effort to enable the agency to simultaneously address multiple public health needs. With emergence of multiple variants and their potential impact on the performance and efficacy of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, it is critical that the FDA is transparent about its thinking in this space so that all parties know they are receiving consistent advice and other individuals have insight into the agency’s decision-making process. In addition to these guidances, the FDA is undertaking scenario planning to prepare us to anticipate and address impacts to products and supply chains as quickly as possible, no matter what path the pandemic takes in the next months. As we continue this process, we are committed to sharing this information with the public when it is ready. We are committed to identifying efficient processes for authorized products that may need to be modified, based on information on emerging variants. We do not believe there will be the need to start at square one with any of these products—we recognize we are in a pandemic and we need to arm health care providers with the most appropriate tools to fight this pandemic on the frontlines. We do not want to create obstacles to getting these tools to the frontlines. As with any evolving situation, we will be continuously monitoring the situation and updating our plans as more information becomes available. We are committed to communicating with you as we continue to determine the best paths forward. We urge Americans to continue to get tested, get their vaccines and follow important health measures—wash your hands, wear a mask and maintain social distance.

The FDA intends to make background materials available to the public, including the meeting agenda and committee roster, no later than two business days prior to the meeting. In general, advisory committees include a chair, members with scientific and public health expertise, and a consumer and industry representative. Additional members with specific expertise may be added for individual meetings as needed. The members of the VRBPAC are independent, scientific and public health experts from around the country who provide advice to the agency, which may include advice on the safety and effectiveness data submitted in the EUA request. However, final decisions on whether to authorize the vaccine for emergency use are made by the FDA. In terms of timing for convening the VRBPAC meeting following the submission of the EUA request, this amount of time will allow the FDA to thoroughly evaluate the data and information submitted in the EUA request before the meeting and to be prepared for a robust public discussion with the advisory committee members. While the FDA cannot predict how long its ongoing evaluation of the data and manufacturing information will take following the VRBPAC meeting to make a decision on the request for an EUA, the agency will review the request as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the discussion by the advisory committee, while still doing so in a thorough and science-based manner. The FDA intends to issue a Federal Register notice as soon as possible with details of the meeting, which will include information about a public docket for comments.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of Novel Device to Reduce Snoring and Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients 18 Years and Older", "date": "February 05, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new prescription only device intended to reduce snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea. Unlike devices used while patients sleep, this is the first device used while awake that is intended to improve tongue muscle function, which in time can help prevent the tongue from collapsing backwards and obstructing the airway during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep-disordered breathing with potential serious long-term effects. It can occur when the upper airway becomes blocked repeatedly during sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. Untreated OSA can lead to serious complications such as heart attack, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer and cognitive and behavioral disorders. OSA is categorized by the number of apneas (pauses in breathing) plus the number of hypopneas (periods of shallow breathing) that occur, on average, each hour. This number, called the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) measures the severity of OSA. Mild OSA is defined as an AHI score of more than five but less than 15. The device, the eXciteOSA, is a removable tongue muscle stimulation device that delivers neuromuscular stimulation to the tongue in order to reduce snoring and mild sleep apnea for patients who are 18 years or older. The eXciteOSA device works by delivering electrical muscle stimulation through a mouthpiece that sits around the tongue. The eXciteOSA mouthpiece has four electrodes, two located above the tongue and two located below the tongue. The device provides electrical muscle stimulation action in sessions that consist of a series of electrical pulses with rest periods in between. It is used for 20 minutes once a day during a wakeful state, for a period of 6‐weeks, and once a week thereafter. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the eXciteOSA device in 115 patients with snoring, including 48 patients with snoring and mild sleep apnea. All patients used the device for 20 minutes, once a day for 6 weeks, then discontinued use for 2 weeks before they were reassessed. Overall, the percent of time spent snoring at levels louder than 40dB was reduced by more than 20% in 87 out of the 115 patients. In a 48-patient subset with snoring and mild OSA, the average AHI reduced by 48%, from 10.21 to 5.27, in 41 out of 48 patients. The most common adverse events observed were excessive salivation, tongue or tooth discomfort, tongue tingling, dental filling sensitivity, metallic taste, gagging and tight jaw. Patients should receive a comprehensive dental examination prior to use of the device. The eXciteOSA device is contraindicated for patients with pacemakers or implanted pacing leads (electrodes); patients with temporary or permanent implants, dental braces, intraoral metal prosthesis/restorations/appliances or dental jewelry in the mouth; patients who are pregnant or may be pregnant; or patients suffering from ulcerations in or around the mouth. The eXciteOSA device is not intended for patients who have or are suspected of having OSA with an AHI of 15 and higher. The FDA reviewed the device through the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. This means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket notification process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Signifier Medical Technologies, LLC. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Treatment For Adults With Relapsed Or Refractory Large-B-Cell Lymphoma", "date": "February 05, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel), a cell-based gene therapy to treat adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to, or who have relapsed after, at least two other types of systemic treatment. Breyanzi, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, is the third gene therapy approved by the FDA for certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Breyanzi is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers that begin in certain cells of the immune system and can be either fast-growing (aggressive) or slow-growing. Approximately 77,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed in the U.S. each year and DLBCL represents approximately one in three newly diagnosed cases. Each dose of Breyanzi is a customized treatment created using a patient’s own T-cells, a type of white blood cell, to help fight the lymphoma. The patient’s T-cells are collected and genetically modified to include a new gene that facilitates targeting and killing of the lymphoma cells. Once the cells are modified, they are infused back into the patient. The safety and efficacy of Breyanzi were established in a multicenter clinical trial of more than 250 adults with refractory or relapsed large B-cell lymphoma. The complete remission rate after treatment with Breyanzi was 54%. Treatment with Breyanzi has the potential to cause severe side effects. The labeling carries a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a systemic response to the activation and proliferation of CAR T cells, causing high fever and flu-like symptoms and neurologic toxicities. Both CRS and neurological events can be life-threatening. Other side effects include hypersensitivity reactions, serious infections, low blood cell counts and a weakened immune system. Side effects generally appear within the first one to two weeks following treatment, but some side effects may occur later. Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Breyanzi is being approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) which includes elements to assure safe use (ETASU). The FDA is requiring, among other things, that healthcare facilities that dispense Breyanzi be specially certified. As part of that certification, staff involved in the prescribing, dispensing or administering of Breyanzi are required to be trained to recognize and manage the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities. The REMS program specifies that patients be informed of the signs and symptoms of CRS and neurological toxicities following infusion – and of the importance of promptly returning to the treatment site if they develop fever or other adverse reactions after receiving treatment with Breyanzi. To further evaluate the long-term safety, the FDA is also requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-marketing observational study involving patients treated with Breyanzi. The FDA granted Breyanzi designations. The RMAT designation program was created under the 21st Century Cures Act to help facilitate the expeditious development of regenerative medicine therapies intended for serious conditions. Breyanzi is the first regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation to be licensed by the FDA. Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The Breyanzi application was reviewed using a coordinated, cross-agency approach, including both the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. The FDA granted approval of Breyanzi to Juno Therapeutics Inc., a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

{"title": "FDA Grants First Conditional Approval Under Expanded Authority to Control Seizures in Dogs with Idiopathic Epilepsy", "date": "January 14, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the first conditional approval under its expanded authority to KBroVet-CA1 (potassium bromide chewable tablets) to control seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. Idiopathic epilepsy is a type of seizure disorder without a known cause. KBroVet-CA1 works by stabilizing neurons in the central nervous system to reduce the likelihood of having a seizure. Congress granted the FDA a limited expansion of the conditional approval pathway for certain new animal drugs under the 2018 reauthorization of the FDA’s Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) program. Conditional approval allows an animal drug sponsor to legally market its product after demonstrating that the drug is safe and manufactured in accordance with full approval standards, and that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness for use. Prior to this expansion, the FDA’s conditional approval of new animal drugs had been limited to drugs for use in minor species (those other than horses, dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, turkeys, and chickens) or for diseases in the major species that occur infrequently or in limited geographic areas and in only a small number of animals annually. The expanded authority allows for conditional approval of treatment options that are intended to address a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, or an unmet health need, but for which demonstrating effectiveness would require complex or particularly difficult studies. KBro-Vet-CA1 meets the criteria of conditional approval under the expanded authority, as there is currently no animal drug approved and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs, a serious or life-threatening condition that affects approximately 5% of the canine population. The initial conditional approval is valid for one year with the potential for four annual renewals. During this time, the animal drug sponsor must demonstrate that it is actively working toward collecting the remaining effectiveness data needed to achieve full approval. The animal drug sponsor must attain full approval within five years after receiving conditional approval, or it will no longer be in effect. Potassium bromide has been used to control seizure disorders in dogs for an extensive period of time, however, prior to FDA being granted the new authority, no animal drug sponsor had applied for approval. To help establish the safety of potassium bromide and meet the agency’s commitment to reduce, replace and refine the use of animals in research, the FDA took an innovative approach that enabled the company to meet the safety standard for approval without performing prospective animal studies. Instead, the sponsor of KBroVet-CA1 was able to use safety data from a Public Master File that the FDA created after conducting a review of more than 50 years of published literature on the use of potassium bromide in dogs. The FDA published Based on the reviewed articles, the most common adverse drug events associated with potassium bromide were found in the neurologic (including behavioral changes), gastrointestinal (including inflammation of the pancreas), reproductive, endocrine, dermatologic and respiratory systems. Some dogs also had increased thirst and urination. Dogs with decreased kidney function may be at greater risk for bromide intoxication (overdose). The reasonable expectation of effectiveness of KBroVet-CA1 was established in a retrospective study of medical records of 51 client-owned dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy that were treated with only potassium bromide at the same dose for at least 60 days to control their seizures. KBroVet-CA1 is orally administered daily for the control of seizures associated with idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. It is available only by prescription due to the professional veterinary expertise required to diagnose idiopathic epilepsy and to monitor safe use of the product, including treatment of any adverse reactions. It is important for owners of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy to work closely with their veterinarians to monitor clinical signs in order to control potential seizures that may result from bromide intoxication. It is also important to avoid abrupt diet changes in dogs receiving potassium bromide because it could either compromise seizure control or raise safety concerns. Signs of severe bromide intoxication can include depression, behavioral changes, ataxia, hind limb paresis, mydriasis, stupor and coma. The FDA granted conditional approval of KBroVet-CA1 to Pegasus Laboratories Inc.

This is the first set of warning letters being issued to firms who have not submitted premarket applications to the FDA and are continuing to sell or distribute unauthorized ENDS after Sept. 9, 2020. Per court order, applications for premarket review for certain deemed new tobacco products on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016—including e-liquids—were required to be submitted to the FDA by Sept. 9, 2020. For companies that submitted applications by that deadline, the FDA generally intends to continue to defer enforcement for up to one year pending FDA review, unless there is a negative action taken by the FDA on the application. The FDA plans to post a list of products for which the agency has received applications; however, before making such a list available, the FDA is verifying certain information about these products so that publication of a list complies with federal disclosure laws.

Despite the contamination, the defendants combined this juice concentrate with newer lots and distributed the mixture to consumers. This included the distribution of juice for use in school lunch programs. The complaint states that the defendants promised to discontinue using the contaminated juice, but a subsequent inspection by the FDA in 2019 showed the defendants continued to blend the older juice with newer juice for distribution. The consent decree of permanent injunction entered by U.S. District Judge Stanley A. Bastian prohibits Valley Processing, Inc. from receiving, preparing, processing, packing, holding, labeling, and/or distributing FDA-regulated products unless and until it completes corrective actions. The defendants represent in the decree that at the time of the entry of the decree, Valley Processing, Inc. had already ceased its juice processing activities. Under the consent decree, Valley Processing, Inc. must destroy any juice still in its possession. Before processing or distributing any juice or food in the future, the defendants first must notify the FDA in advance, comply with specific remedial measures set forth in the injunction, and permit the FDA to inspect their facilities and procedures. The U.S. Department of Justice filed the complaint on behalf of the FDA.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Generic of Drug Used to Treat Severe Hypoglycemia", "date": "December 28, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic of glucagon for injection USP, 1 mg/vial packaged in an emergency kit, for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia (very low blood sugar), which may occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. The drug is also indicated as a diagnostic aid in the radiologic examination of the stomach, duodenum (the first part of the small intestine beyond the stomach), small bowel and colon when diminished intestinal motility (reduced ability to move) would be advantageous. Severe hypoglycemia occurs when a patient’s blood sugar falls to a level where he or she becomes confused or unconscious, or suffers from other symptoms that require assistance from another person to treat. Typically, severe hypoglycemia occurs in people with diabetes who are using insulin treatment. The generic glucagon for injection is a synthetic version of human glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that causes the liver to quickly increase blood sugar levels. This hormone also slows down movement of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common side effects associated with glucagon for injection are nausea and vomiting, a temporary increase in heart rate, as well as redness and swelling of the injection site. The FDA regularly takes steps to help guide industry through the development process for generic drug products, including complex products such as glucagon. The development of complex products can be more difficult due to their complex active ingredient, formulation, or mode of delivery. As a result, many complex drugs lack generic competition even after patents and exclusivities no longer block generic approval. The FDA maintains a list of without an approved generic to improve transparency and encourage the development and submission of applications for drugs with limited competition. Glucagon is included on this list. The FDA also prioritizes the review of submissions for generic drugs for which there are fewer than three approved generics of the reference listed drug (RLD) and for which there are no blocking patents or exclusivities on the RLD. Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA), individual companies can meet with the FDA as part of its to support the development of such complex generic drug products. The FDA also publishes guidance documents describing the steps the FDA recommends companies take to submit complete applications for generic drug products. The FDA requires sponsors to submit appropriate data and information to demonstrate that complex generic drug products meet the agency’s rigorous approval standards. These standards ensure that quality generic drug products are as safe and effective as their brand name counterparts. Addressing the challenges related to complex generics, and promoting more generic competition to these medicines, is a key part of the , and the agency’s efforts to promote patient access and more affordable medicines. The FDA granted approval of this generic glucagon for injection to Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.

{"title": "FDA Takes Steps to Provide Clarity on Developing New Drug Products in the Age of Individualized Medicine", "date": "January 04, 2021", "contents": " Advances in scientific knowledge and drug development technology have provided an opportunity for new approaches to drug development, including the development of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases. These advances have contributed to an increase in development and approval of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases in recent years. In fact, in the past eight years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved more than twice as many drugs for rare diseases, often referred to as orphan drugs, as in the previous eight years. For genetic diseases, recent approaches to testing and molecular diagnosis have allowed us to pinpoint, in some cases, the exact cause of a patient’s disease. For a patient with a very rare genetic disease, development of a drug product that is tailored to that patient’s specific genetic variant may be possible. This is an important advance in treatment for those with very rare genetic diseases, especially those for which there are no adequate therapies available to treat the disease. Often, these very rare diseases are rapidly progressing, debilitating, and in many cases, can lead to premature death if left untreated. Developing these products – also referred to as “n of 1” therapies by some because they are designed for a patient population of one person – brings a set of challenges and considerations not seen with the typical drug development process. First, as noted above, the disease is often rapidly progressing, requiring prompt medical intervention. Therefore, development needs to proceed very quickly to have a chance at helping the individual. Second, drug discovery and development for these drug products may be carried out by academic investigators, rather than by biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies. These investigators may be less familiar with FDA’s regulations, policies and practices, and less experienced in interacting with the FDA. At this time, development of individualized genetic drug products is most advanced for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) products. Therefore, we are taking the first steps in bringing clarity to this emerging area of individualized drug development by releasing a new on investigational new drug (IND) submissions for individualized ASO drug products. The guidance was developed to advise those developing ASO products on an approach to interacting with, and making regulatory submissions to, the FDA. The guidance addresses the following points: As also discussed in a editorial in October 2019, we are fully aware that this new drug-discovery paradigm raises many ethical and societal issues that will need to be addressed throughout the process. For example, in these situations, the individuals and their families often function more like drug development collaborators than traditional trial participants. Therefore, it is important to discuss with the individual and family members how effectiveness will be measured. It is also important to ensure that the individual and family members understand the parameters for continuing administration of the investigational drug product before emotions influence decisions, and to recognize that some investigational drug products may fail, or worse, lead to unforeseen side effects. The FDA understands that we’ll need to work together with the developers of these drug products to bring them safely to patients, and we are willing to engage as needed to address the challenges. For example, for those developing these drug products, it will be important to further understand the required data and information that must be submitted to the FDA so that clinical testing can begin. The FDA is continuing to consider and further develop policy to address some of these issues. We also are optimistic that development of these individualized drug products may spur gene sequencing that leads to the development of additional individualized drug products for the same disease (though perhaps caused by a different mutation). For this approach to drug development, we need to determine – collectively – how to effectively bring these drug products to all who need them. If we have the scientific ability to develop drug products for these rare diseases, we need to find a way to bring them to patients while ensuring there is the right balance of risk to benefit. This guidance, which provides clarity on the early development and IND submission process, is the FDA’s first step in working with those who are developing these individualized drug products.

{"title": "FDA Takes Key Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine", "date": "December 11, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that  circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Antigen Test as First Over-the-Counter Fully At-Home Diagnostic Test for COVID-19", "date": "December 15, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the first over-the-counter (OTC) fully at-home diagnostic test for COVID-19. The is a rapid, lateral flow antigen test, a type of test that runs a liquid sample along a surface with reactive molecules. The test detects fragments of proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from a nasal swab sample from any individual 2 years of age or older. The announcement today of the first fully at-home OTC COVID-19 diagnostic test follows last month’s of the first prescription COVID-19 test for home use and last week’s announcement of the first non-prescription test system, in which a lab processes the self-collected sample. The FDA has authorized more than 225 diagnostic tests for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, including more than 25 tests that allow for home collection of samples, which are then sent to a lab for testing. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is the first COVID-19 test that can be used completely at home without a prescription. Similar to other antigen tests, a small percentage of positive and negative results from this test may be false. Therefore, for patients without symptoms, positive results should be treated as presumptively positive until confirmed by another test as soon as possible. This is especially true if there are fewer infections in a particular community, as false positive results can be more common when antigen tests are used in populations where there is little COVID-19 (low prevalence). The FDA reminds patients that all tests can experience false negative and false positive results. Individuals with positive results should self-isolate and seek additional care from their health care provider. Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider as negative results do not preclude an individual from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test uses a mid-turbinate nasal swab (sample is collected further back than the usual nasal swab, but not as far back as nasopharyngeal swabs, which are only appropriate for use by a trained health care provider) to detect certain proteins of the virus known as antigens. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test correctly identified 96% of positive samples and 100% of negative samples in individuals with symptoms. In people without symptoms, the test correctly identified 91% of positive samples and 96% of negative samples. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test uses an analyzer that connects with a software application on a smartphone to help users perform the test and interpret results. Results are delivered in as little as 20 minutes to individuals via their smartphone. The mobile application requires individuals to input their zip code and date of birth, with optional fields including name and e-mail address, and reports the results as appropriate to public health authorities to monitor disease prevalence. Ellume expects to produce more than three million tests in January 2021. The FDA continues to work with test developers to expand access to COVID-19 testing and supports further development of COVID-19 tests that can be used completely at home.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Cell-Based Gene Therapy for Adult Patients with Multiple Myeloma", "date": "March 27, 2021", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel), a cell-based gene therapy to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have not responded to, or whose disease has returned after, at least four prior lines (different types) of therapy. Abecma is the first cell-based gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. “The FDA remains committed to advancing novel treatment options for areas of unmet patient need,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “While there is no cure for multiple myeloma, the long-term outlook can vary based on the individual’s age and the stage of the condition at the time of diagnosis. Today’s approval provides a new treatment option for patients who have this uncommon type of cancer.” Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of blood cancer in which abnormal plasma cells build up in the bone marrow and form tumors in many bones of the body. This disease keeps the bone marrow from making enough healthy blood cells, which can result in low blood counts. Myeloma can also damage the bones and the kidneys and weaken the immune system. The exact cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. According to the , myeloma accounted for approximately 1.8% (32,000) of all new cancer cases in the United States in 2020. Abecma is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Each dose of Abecma is a customized treatment created by using a patient’s own T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, to help fight the myeloma. The patient’s T-cells are collected and genetically modified to include a new gene that facilitates targeting and killing myeloma cells. Once the cells are modified, they are infused back into the patient. The safety and efficacy of Abecma were established in a multicenter study of 127 patients with relapsed myeloma (myeloma that returns after completion of treatment) and refractory myeloma (myeloma that does not respond to treatment), who received at least three prior antimyeloma lines of therapy. About 88% of patients in the study group had received four or more prior lines of antimyeloma therapy. Overall, 72% of patients partially or completely responded to the treatment. Of those studied, 28% of patients showed complete response—or disappearance of all signs of multiple myeloma—to Abecma, and 65% of this group remained in complete response to the treatment for at least 12 months. Treatment with Abecma has the potential to cause severe side effects. The carries a boxed warning for, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS), neurologic toxicity, and prolonged cytopenia, all of which can be fatal or life-threatening. CRS and HLH/MAS are systemic responses to the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells causing high fever and flu-like symptoms, and prolonged cytopenia is a drop in the number of a certain blood cell type for an extended period of time. The most common side effects of Abecma include CRS, infections, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and a weakened immune system. Side effects from treatment usually appear within the first one to two weeks after treatment, but some side effects may occur later. Patients with multiple myeloma should consult with their health care professionals to determine whether Abecma is an appropriate treatment for them. Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Abecma is being approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy which includes elements to assure safe use. The FDA is requiring that hospitals and their associated clinics that dispense Abecma be specially certified and staff involved in the prescribing, dispensing or administering of Abecma are trained to recognize and manage CRS and nervous system toxicities and other side effects of Abecma. Also, patients must be informed of the potential serious side effects and of the importance of promptly returning to the treatment site if side effects develop after receiving Abecma. To further evaluate the long-term safety, the FDA is also requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-marketing observational study involving patients treated with Abecma. Abecma was granted designations by the FDA. Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted based on sustained responses observed in patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. Drugs approved under expedited programs, such as Breakthrough Therapy designation, are held to the same approval standards as all other FDA approvals. The FDA granted approval of Abecma to Celgene Corporation, a Bristol Myers Squibb company.

The Tiger Tech COVID Plus Monitor is intended for use by trained personnel to help prevent exposure to and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The device identifies certain biomarkers that may be indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other hypercoagulable conditions (such as sepsis or cancer) or hyper-inflammatory states (such as severe allergic reactions), in asymptomatic individuals over the age of 5. The Tiger Tech COVID Plus Monitor is designed for use following a temperature reading that does not meet criteria for fever in settings where temperature check is being conducted in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local institutional infection prevention and control guidelines. This device is not a substitute for a COVID-19 diagnostic test and is not intended for use in individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. The device is an armband with embedded light sensors and a small computer processor. The armband is wrapped around a person’s bare left arm above the elbow during use. The sensors first obtain pulsatile signals from blood flow over a period of three to five minutes. Once the measurement is completed, the processor extracts some key features of the pulsatile signals, such as pulse rate, and feeds them into a probabilistic machine learning model that has been trained to make predictions on whether the individual is showing certain signals, such as hypercoagulation in blood. Hypercoagulation is known to be a . The result is provided in the form of different colored lights used to indicate if an individual is demonstrating certain biomarkers, or if the result is inconclusive. The clinical performance of the Tiger Tech COVID Plus Monitor was studied in hospital and school settings. The hospital study, which was considered a validation study, enrolled 467 asymptomatic individuals, including 69 confirmed positive cases, and demonstrated that the Tiger Tech COVID Plus Monitor had a positive percent agreement (proportion of the COVID-19 positive individuals identified correctly by the device to possess certain biomarkers) of 98.6% and a negative percent agreement (proportion of the COVID-19 negative individuals identified correctly by the device to not possess certain biomarkers) of 94.5%. The school study, which was considered a confirmatory study, showed similar performance. The Tiger Tech COVID Plus Monitor is not a diagnostic device and must not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. The device is intended for use on individuals without a fever. An individual’s underlying condition may interfere with the COVID-19 related performance of the device and could lead to an incorrect screening result.

{"title": "FDA Approves New indication for Drug to Treat Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity in Pediatric Patients", "date": "March 25, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new indication for Myrbetriq (mirabegron extended-release tablets) and Myrbetriq Granules (mirabegron for extended-release oral suspension) to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages three years and older. Myrbetriq is also indicated for overactive bladder in adult patients. NDO is a dysfunction of the bladder that results from congenital conditions (inherited conditions beginning at or before birth), such as spina bifida, or other disease or injury in the nervous system, such as spinal cord injury. With NDO, there is overactivity of the bladder wall muscle, which normally relaxes to allow storage of urine. The bladder wall muscle overactivity in NDO results in sporadic bladder muscle contraction, which increases pressure in the bladder and decreases the volume of urine the bladder can hold. If NDO is not treated, increased pressure in the bladder can put the upper urinary tract at risk of harm, including possible permanent damage to the kidneys. In addition, spontaneous bladder muscle contractions can lead to unexpected and frequent leakage of urine with symptoms of urinary urgency (immediate need to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than normal) and incontinence (loss of bladder control). The efficacy of Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules for the pediatric NDO indication was established in a study of 86 patients ages 3 to 17 years old. Improvements occurred in patients’ maximum cystometric (bladder) capacity, number of detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contractions, volume of urine held until first detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contraction and number of daily urine leakage episodes after 24 weeks of treatment. The most common side effects with Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules with NDO were urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis (common cold), constipation and headache. Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules may increase blood pressure and may make blood pressure worse in patients with a history of high blood pressure. Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules may cause angioedema, an allergic reaction with swelling of the lips, face, tongue or throat. Patients should promptly discontinue Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules and seek medical attention if angioedema associated with upper airway swelling occurs, as this may be life-threatening. Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules are two different products and they are not substitutable on a milligram-per-milligram basis.

{"title": "FDA Approves First in the World Device to Treat Patients with Congenital Heart Disease", "date": "March 26, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first in the world non-surgical heart valve to treat pediatric and adult patients with a native or surgically-repaired right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), the part of the heart that carries blood out of the right ventricle to the lungs. The device is designed for patients who have severe pulmonary valve regurgitation (blood leaking backward into the right lower chamber of the heart), a condition that often results from congenital heart disease. The device, called the Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) System, is intended to improve blood flow to the lungs in patients with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation without open-heart surgery, which is the current standard of care. The use of the Harmony valve may delay the time before a patient needs additional open-heart surgery. It can also potentially reduce the total number of open-heart surgeries required over an individual’s lifetime. (CHDs) are conditions that are present at birth and can affect the structure of a baby’s heart and the way it works. They are the most common type of birth defect, affecting about 40,000 babies born each year. It is estimated that over two million infants, children, adolescents and adults are living with CHDs in the U.S. Patients with CHDs often require heart procedures early in life to help improve blood flow to the lungs. After having one of these procedures, the patient may or may not have a working pulmonary valve, which could lead to pulmonary regurgitation. Severe pulmonary valve regurgitation may be corrected through open-heart surgery to place a right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit or an artificial valve. During the implantation procedure of a Harmony valve, a thin, hollow tube (catheter) with a collapsed Harmony valve on the end is inserted through a vein in the groin or in the neck and into the right side of the heart, and then into the RVOT where it is placed into position. The valve is then released from the catheter; it expands on its own, and anchors to the RVOT. Once the new valve is in place, it opens and closes like a door to force the blood to flow in the correct direction. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Harmony TPV device through a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study. During the study, physicians implanted the device in a total of 70 patients. All patients were scheduled for follow-up examinations at the start of the study, at implant procedure, discharge, and post implant at one month, six months, and annually through five years. The follow-up has been extended to 10 years as part of the post-approval study. The primary safety endpoint was no procedure- or device-related death within 30 days following the implant, which 100% of patients attained. The primary effectiveness endpoint was percentage of patients with no additional surgical or interventional procedures related to the device and acceptable heart blood flow function at six months. Among patients with evaluable echocardiography data, 89.2% of them achieved the primary effectiveness endpoint. Adverse events observed during the clinical study included irregular or abnormal heart rhythms (23.9%, including 14.1% ventricular tachycardia), leakage around the valve (8.5%, including 1.4% major leakage), minor bleeding (7.0%), narrowing of the pulmonary valve (4.2%), and movement of the implant (4.2%). The Harmony TPV device is contraindicated for patients with an infection in the heart or elsewhere; patients who cannot tolerate blood thinning medicines; or patients who have sensitivity to Nitinol (titanium or nickel). The Harmony TPV device was granted for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. Breakthrough Device Designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of Device to Improve Gait in Multiple Sclerosis Patients  ", "date": "March 26, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new device indicated for use as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild to moderate symptoms from multiple sclerosis (MS). The device is intended to be used by prescription only as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and older. The device, called Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS), is a neuromuscular tongue stimulator that consists of a non-implantable apparatus to generate electrical pulses for stimulation of the trigeminal and facial nerves via the tongue to provide treatment of motor deficits. MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communications between the brain and other parts of the body. According to the , most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40 and the disease occurs more frequently in women than in men. MS is a disease that affects people differently as it causes a variety of symptoms—such as problems with walking and balance—that can interfere with daily activities but can usually be treated or managed. The most common walking problem is unsteady, uncoordinated movements (known as ataxia) due to damage to the areas of the brain that coordinate muscle balance. People with severe ataxia generally benefit from the use of a cane, walker, or other assistive device. Physical therapy can also reduce walking problems. The PoNS device is a portable, non-implantable device which delivers mild neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the dorsal surface of the patient’s tongue. It consists of a controller and a mouthpiece that are connected to each other by a cord. The mouthpiece is held lightly in place by the lips and teeth and the control unit is worn around the neck during a patient’s visit with a therapist. The controller sends signals to the mouthpiece placed on the tongue; receptors on the tongue send millions of neural impulses to the brain through natural pathways. Additionally, the therapist can connect the control unit to a computer and view usage data via software developed specifically for the PoNS device. The usage data gives the therapist information on how to improve a patient’s execution of therapy by identifying potential areas of missed or shortened sessions. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS device through two clinical studies and a retrospective analysis of real-world data (RWD). In the first study, 20 patients with gait deficits due to MS participated in a randomized, double blind controlled trial where 10 patients used the PoNS device and the remaining 10 patients used a sham control device that did not deliver stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) where the clinician scored an index of eight gait tasks. The DGI was assessed for a baseline, at two weeks, six weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks. The results showed that the PoNS group on average achieved improvement in their DGI score of 7.95 at the end of the study, which was statistically significant and clinically significant, while the control group did not. In the second study, the clinicians investigated the effects of the PoNS device with cognitive rehab and physical rehab in 14 patients with MS, who did not know whether they had the PoNS device or the sham control device, in a randomized controlled trial where seven patients used the PoNS device and the other seven used a sham device. Baseline evaluations included sensory organization tasks (SOT) and DGI scores. The PoNS device group showed a statistically significant improvement in SOT scores at 14 weeks compared to the baseline value. Analysis of DGI scores after 14 weeks showed no significant result. The sponsor also provided a retrospective analysis of RWD collected with the PoNS device in MS patients in clinical rehabilitation settings. Patients who agreed to treatment were given 1-hr consultation, provided consent, and given baseline assessments of gait function using Functional Gait Assessment. No serious safety adverse events were reported in the clinical studies or retrospective analysis of RWD. The PoNS device should not be used by patients with penetrating brain injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, oral health problems, chronic infectious diseases, unmanaged hypertension or diabetes, pacemakersand/or a history of seizures. Because the PoNS device delivers electrical stimulation directly to the surface of the tongue, precautions for use are similar to those for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Electrical stimulation should not be used if there is an active or suspected malignant tumor; in areas of recent bleeding or open wounds; or in areas that lack normal sensation. The PoNS device has not been tested on, and thus should not be used by, individuals under the age of 22 or who are pregnant. The PoNS device should not be used if a patient is sensitive to nickel, gold or copper. Patients should use the PoNS device with caution, and electrical stimulation should only be used after seeking professional medical advice. For a full list of warnings and precautions to consider if using the PoNS device, please consult the device labeling. The PoNS device was granted designation, which is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The FDA reviewed the PoNS device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.

{"title": "FDA Approves First-of-its-Kind Intentional Genomic Alteration in Line of Domestic Pigs for Both Human Food, Potential Therapeutic Uses", "date": "December 14, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a first-of-its-kind intentional genomic alteration (IGA) in a line of domestic pigs, referred to as GalSafe pigs, which may be used for food or human therapeutics. This is the first IGA in an animal that the FDA has approved for both human food consumption and as a source for potential therapeutic uses. The IGA in GalSafe pigs is intended to eliminate alpha-gal sugar on the surface of the pigs’ cells. People with Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) may have mild to severe allergic reactions to alpha-gal sugar found in red meat (e.g., beef, pork, and lamb). GalSafe pigs may potentially provide a source of porcine-based materials to produce human medical products that are free of detectable alpha-gal sugar. For example, GalSafe pigs could potentially be used as a source of medical products, such as the blood-thinning drug heparin, free of detectable alpha-gal sugar. Tissues and organs from GalSafe pigs could potentially address the issue of immune rejection in patients receiving , as alpha-gal sugar is believed to be a cause of rejection in patients. As part of its review, the FDA evaluated the safety of the IGA for the animals and people eating meat from them, as well as the product developer’s intention to market the IGA for its ability to eliminate alpha-gal sugar on pigs’ cells. The FDA  determined that food from GalSafe pigs is safe for the general population to eat. The FDA’s review also focused on ensuring the effectiveness of the IGA through the evaluation of data demonstrating that there is no detectable level of alpha-gal sugar across multiple generations of GalSafe pigs. As part of its review, the FDA analyzed the potential impact that the approval of the IGA in GalSafe pigs would have on the U.S. environment and determined it is no greater than from conventional pigs. The conditions under which GalSafe pigs will be kept are far more stringent than those for conventionally farmed pigs. Additionally, no animal safety concerns were noted for GalSafe pigs beyond those that would be expected in well-managed, commercial swine operations. The FDA also assessed the risk of the IGA to promote the emergence or selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of human health concern in or on GalSafe pigs. The FDA concluded that the microbial food safety risk is low and is mitigated by the low number of GalSafe pigs entering the food supply and the ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, among other factors. Because the product developer’s application to the FDA did not include data regarding elimination or prevention of food allergies, the FDA’s review process did not evaluate food safety specific to those with AGS, a recently identified type of food allergy to red meat and other products derived from mammals. In the U.S., the condition most often begins when a Lone Star tick bites someone and transmits alpha-gal sugar into the person's body. In some people, this triggers an immune system reaction that later produces mild to severe allergic reactions to alpha-gal sugar found in red meat. It’s important to note that these pigs have not been evaluated for use as xenotransplantation products for transplantation or implantation into human subjects. Developers of any such human medical products must first submit an application to, and obtain approval from, the FDA before these products can be used in human medicine. The product developer indicated that it initially intends to sell meat from GalSafe pigs by mail order, rather than in supermarkets. The FDA granted approval of the IGA in GalSafe pigs to Revivicor Inc.

The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test is authorized for prescription use at home with self-collected nasal swab samples from individuals ages 15 years or older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset. It is also authorized for use with adult-collected nasal swab samples from individuals ages four years or older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset. The test will be offered in partnership with a telehealth service that will take users step-by-step through the sample collection process and provide assistance in reading and understanding the results. The telehealth provider will also report all test results to the relevant public health authorities in accordance with local, state, and federal requirements. In general, antigen tests are very specific for COVID-19, but are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests. This means that there is a higher chance of false negatives than with many molecular tests. Positive results from antigen tests, while generally highly accurate, may be subject to false positive results especially in areas where there are fewer infections. Individuals with positive results should self-isolate and seek additional care from their health care provider. Negative results do not preclude an individual from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals who test negative may need additional testing, particularly those who continue to experience COVID-like symptoms.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of New Implant to Repair a Torn ACL", "date": "December 16, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted marketing authorization—under the De Novo premarket review pathway—for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) implant, intended to serve as an alternative to ACL reconstruction to treat ACL tears. The device, the Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR) Implant, unlike traditional reconstruction, does not require the use of harvested tendons for ACL repair and is the only currently- available alternative to reconstruction with allograft, autograft or suture-only repair for the treatment of ACL rupture. The ACL, a ligament stretching from the front to the back of the knee, aids in keeping the knee stable. Despite being a very common injury, until today, the only surgical treatment available for torn ACLs has been ACL reconstruction using allograft, autograft or suture-only repair. The BEAR Implant is a resorbable implant—meaning it is absorbed by the body—made from bovine collagen and is secured via suture to bridge the gap between the torn ends of a patient’s ACL. The patient’s own blood is injected into the implant during the surgical implantation procedure with the intent of forming a device-protected clot that enables the body’s healing process. Within about eight weeks of the BEAR Implant surgical procedure, it is absorbed and replaced by the body’s own tissue. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the BEAR Implant in a randomized controlled trial of 100 subjects with complete ACL rupture. In the study, 65 patients received the BEAR Implant and 35 members of the control group received ACL reconstruction with autograft (using their own tendon from another part of the body). Patients received physical therapy and were followed for two years. At the two-year mark, patients who received the BEAR Implant reported an average score of 88.6 and control subjects reported an average score of 84.6 using the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Score, a patient-reported outcome measure (questionnaire) that asks questions about symptoms related to pain and stiffness, sports activity and knee function. The patients also underwent arthrometry, a noninvasive measurement of laxity—or looseness—of the knee joint. Arthrometry measures the difference in laxity between a person’s healthy leg and their injured leg. In arthrometric assessments, measurements below 3 mm (the height of a stack of two pennies) are considered to be normal. At two years, subjects who received the BEAR implant had a laxity that, on average, was greater by 1.7 mm (about the same as the thickness of a penny) in the treated knee than that of the untreated knee. At two years, control subjects had a laxity that, on average, was greater by 1.8 mm in the treated knee than that of the untreated knee. Complications observed in the study consisted of graft or repair failure and the need for additional surgical procedures. The FDA reviewed the BEAR Implant through the , a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The BEAR Implant is indicated for skeletally‐mature patients at least 14 years of age with a complete rupture of the ACL, as confirmed by MRI. Patients must have an ACL stump attached to the tibia to construct the repair. The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Miach Orthopaedics, Inc.

Food loss and waste negatively impact food security, the economy, communities, and the environment. Since the Trump Administration launched the , the collaborative effort has achieved great success. Public-private partnerships, like the , are key to successfully reducing food loss and waste by implementing proven strategies and sharing best practices. In 2020, the Trump Administration welcomed ten new businesses and organizations to the 2030 Champions. Today's renewed three-year agreement will continue to build on these successful partnerships and reiterate our shared commitment to work towards the national goal of reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030. “The United States is getting a handle on its serious food waste problem,” “The three-year renewal of this joint agency agreement will help our country achieve its ambitious goal of cutting food waste by 50 percent by 2030.” “Our nation’s agricultural abundance should be used to nourish those in need, not fill the trash,” “As the world’s population continues to grow and the food systems continue to evolve, now is the time to continue to educate consumers and businesses alike on the need for food waste reduction.” “We’ve seen great strides in food loss and waste reduction since first entering the joint agency formal agreement with our Federal colleagues, and through collaborative efforts with our public and private partners,” “At FDA, we’ve encouraged food manufacturers and retailers to standardize the way quality-based date labels are used on packaged foods and developed to educate consumers. With these continued partnerships and important efforts, we’re on track to see a 50% reduction of food waste by 2030.” As part of the , EPA, USDA, and FDA issued its FY2019-2020 Federal Interagency Strategy in April 2019, which identifies six priority areas on which the agencies will focus their efforts to reduce food loss and waste in the U.S. In May 2020, the Federal Interagency Strategy was updated by listing contributing efforts for each of the strategy's six priority action areas: The agencies also launched partnerships with organizations at the forefront of food loss and waste reduction efforts. In April 2019, the agencies signed an agreement with ReFED, a network of the nation's leading business, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing U.S. food waste. In October 2019, another partnership with the , formalized collaboration on education and outreach efforts with three major sectors of the supply chain: food manufacturing, retail, and restaurant and food service. among USDA, EPA, and FDA to reduce food loss and waste through combined and agency-specific actions.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Treatment for Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Some Progeroid Laminopathies", "date": "November 20, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zokinvy (lonafarnib) capsules to reduce the risk of death due to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and for the treatment of certain processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies in patients one year of age and older. Zokinvy is not approved for use in patients with other progeroid syndromes or laminopathies. “Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies are rare genetic diseases that cause premature aging and death and have a debilitating effect on people’s lives,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc, director of the Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “With today’s approval, Zokinvy is the first FDA-approved medication for these devastating diseases. The FDA will continue to work with stakeholders to advance the development of additional new, effective and safe therapies for these patients.” Patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies experience accelerated cardiovascular disease from the buildup of defective progerin or progerin-like protein in cells. Most patients die before the age of 15 years from heart failure, heart attack or stroke. Before today’s approval, the only treatment options included supportive care and therapies directed towards the complications arising from the disease. Zokinvy, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, is an oral medication that helps prevent the buildup of defective progerin or progerin-like protein. The effectiveness of Zokinvy for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was demonstrated in 62 patients from two single-arm trials that were compared to matched, untreated patients from a separate natural history study. Compared to untreated patients, the lifespan of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients treated with Zokinvy increased by an average of three months through the first three years of treatment and by an average of 2.5 years through the maximum follow-up time of 11 years. Zokinvy’s approval for the treatment of certain processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies that are very rare took into account similarities in the underlying genetic mechanism of disease and other available data. The most common side effects included nausea vomiting, diarrhea, infection, decreased appetite and fatigue. Zokinvy is contraindicated for co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers, as well as midazolam and certain cholesterol-lowering medications. Some patients treated with Zokinvy developed laboratory test abnormalities, such as changes in blood sodium and potassium levels, lowered white blood cell counts and increased liver blood tests. Routine blood laboratory testing should be obtained periodically. Eye toxicity was seen in animals so eye exams are recommended periodically and if there are new visual changes. The FDA granted this application Priority Review designation. Zokinvy received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. In addition, the manufacturer received a . The FDA’s rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program is intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics to prevent and treat rare diseases in children. The FDA granted the approval of Zokinvy to Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.

This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions. In a clinical trial of patients with COVID-19, casirivimab and imdevimab, administered together, were shown to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to placebo. The safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy for use in the treatment of COVID-19 continues to be evaluated. Casirivimab and imdevimab must be administered together by intravenous (IV) infusion. Casirivimab and imdevimab are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. A benefit of casirivimab and imdevimab treatment has not been shown in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as casirivimab and imdevimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. Casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that casirivimab and imdevimab administered together may be effective in treating patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. When used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits of these antibodies outweigh the known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together for the authorized population. The data supporting this EUA for casirivimab and imdevimab are based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 799 non-hospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Of these patients, 266 received a single intravenous infusion of 2,400 milligrams casirivimab and imdevimab (1,200 mg of each), 267 received 8,000 mg casirivimab and imdevimab (4,000 mg of each), and 266 received a placebo, within three days of obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test. The prespecified primary endpoint for the trial was time-weighted average change in viral load from baseline. Viral load reduction in patients treated with casirivimab and imdevimab was larger than in patients treated with placebo at day seven. However, the most important evidence that casirivimab and imdevimab administered together may be effective came from the predefined secondary endpoint of medically attended visits related to COVID-19, particularly hospitalizations and emergency room visits within 28 days after treatment. For patients at high risk for disease progression, hospitalizations and emergency room visits occurred in 3% of casirivimab and imdevimab-treated patients on average compared to 9% in placebo-treated patients. The effects on viral load, reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits were similar in patients receiving either of the two casirivimab and imdevimab doses. Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using casirivimab and imdevimab administered together in treating COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to . These fact sheets include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects of casirivimab and imdevimab include: anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions, fever, chills, hives, itching and flushing.

{"title": "FDA Expands Approval of Influenza Treatment to Post-Exposure Prevention", "date": "November 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the approved indication for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) to include post-exposure prevention of influenza (flu) for patients 12 years of age and older after contact with an individual who has the flu. Xofluza, previously available only in tablet form, is also now available as granules for mixing in water. Xofluza was originally in 2018 for treating uncomplicated flu in patients 12 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by Treating flu patients with antiviral drugs within 48 hours of their becoming sick can reduce symptoms and duration of the illness. An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu. Xofluza’s safety and efficacy for post-flu exposure prevention is supported by one randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which 607 subjects, 12 years of age and older who were exposed to a person with influenza in their household, received either a single dose of Xofluza or a single dose of a placebo. Of these 607 subjects, 303 received Xofluza and 304 received the placebo. The trial’s primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were infected with influenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom from day 1 to day 10. Of those who received Xofluza, 1% of subjects met these criteria, compared to 13% of subjects who received a placebo for the clinical trial. The most common side effects of Xofluza include diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea, sinusitis and headache. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis (allergic reaction), can occur in patients taking Xofluza. Patients should not take Xofluza if they have had a known hypersensitivity reaction to Xofluza.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Drug to Treat Rare Metabolic Disorder ", "date": "November 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Oxlumo (lumasiran) as the first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare genetic disorder. This approval is a cumulation of the work of experts and community members coordinated by the Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation and the Kidney Health Initiative. Primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are caused by excess production of oxalate, a substance consumed in food and also produced by the body. PH1 is the most common and severe type. PH1 affects an estimated one to three individuals per million in North America and Europe and accounts for approximately 80% of PH cases. Patients with PH1 produce far too much oxalate, which can combine with calcium to cause kidney stones and deposits in the kidneys. Patients can experience progressive kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure and the need for dialysis (a treatment that purifies the blood). As kidney function worsens, oxalate can build up and damage other organs, including the heart, bones and eyes. Oxlumo works to decrease oxalate production. It was evaluated in two studies in patients with PH1: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients six years and older and an open-label study in patients younger than six years. Patients ranged in age from four months to 61 years at the first dose. In the first study, 26 patients received a monthly injection of Oxlumo followed by a maintenance dose every three months; 13 patients received placebo injections. The primary endpoint was the amount of oxalate measured in the urine over 24 hours. In the Oxlumo group, patients had, on average, a 65% reduction of oxalate in the urine, compared to an average 12% reduction in the placebo group. By the sixth month of the study, 52% of patients treated with Oxlumo reached a normal 24-hour urinary oxalate level; no patients treated with the placebo did. In the second study, 16 patients younger than six years all received Oxlumo. Using another measure of oxalate in the urine, the study showed, on average, a 71% decrease in urinary oxalate by the sixth month of the study. The most common side effects of Oxlumo include injection site reaction and abdominal pain. Oxlumo received , which provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases.

Under the June 6, 2020 version of this EUA, a respirator was authorized if it met any of three predetermined eligibility criteria. Effective immediately, the reissued EUA no longer includes the three eligibility criteria, meaning the FDA will no longer review requests nor add to the list of authorized respirators–known as Appendix A—of this EUA based on those criteria. The FDA recognizes there is still a shortage of FFRs, and to provide additional capacity as needed, the agency is continuing the emergency use authorization of respirator models that are already included in of this reissued EUA. To further inform the EUAs, the FDA completed a respirator shortage assessment to understand current product availability for both NIOSH-approved N95s and KN95 respirators and use practices for each. The assessment shows that the KN95 respirator models authorized by this EUA meet the demand for these respirators. As part of this assessment, the agency heard directly from health care personnel that the KN95 design has limited adoption in health care settings; from distributors that imported, non-NIOSH-approved product from China is sitting in warehouses unused; and from manufacturers that NIOSH-approved N95 production is increasing. Additionally, CDC/NIOSH continues to issue more N95 approvals. The FDA is reissuing this EUA to authorize only those respirators the FDA had already authorized and that are presently listed in Appendix A. As outlined in the reissued EUA, FDA has removed the previous eligibility criteria and, therefore, no additional respirator models will be added to Appendix A under those criteria. As such, the FDA is no longer reviewing requests submitted based on the June 6, 2020 EUA’s criteria. As a result of this EUA’s reissuance, FDA expects that staff and agency resources that were devoted to reviewing those submissions can instead focus on other critical needs during the COVID-19 public health emergency, including continuing to work with CDC/NIOSH to help facilitate the availability of respiratory protection that meets the applicable standards and demands of health care personnel. The FDA is committed to refining our policies and approaches as appropriate to further facilitate the development and availability of these devices for health care personnel."},

Additionally, this latest partnership embraces the use of new and emerging technologies, leverages food safety programs at SENASICA and COFEPRIS and their work with local industry, and further enhances the collaborations of U.S. and Mexico with other key partners. Historically, the FDA and its regulatory counterparts in Mexico have worked collaboratively due to the high volume of food trade across the border. In 2014, they signed a partnership focused on produce safety. About one-third of all imported food into the U.S. is from Mexico and 60% of all imported produce is from Mexico. As a result, the FDA, SENASICA, and COFEPRIS work closely together on food establishment inspections and responding to foodborne illness outbreaks, as well as developing and implementing plans to enhance food safety in other areas of mutual public health interest. The three agencies have initially structured their food safety partnership to focus on areas of mutual interest related to human food safety, such as: prevention (e.g., Salmonella in papaya and Cyclospora in other produce), outbreak response, regulatory laboratory collaboration (e.g., Whole Genome Sequencing of foodborne bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens), and outreach/training opportunities for industry (e.g., Produce Safety and Preventive Controls for Human Foods). Through this new partnership, the FDA, SENASICA, and COFEPRIS will further strengthen their close collaboration by including all human foods under the FDA’s jurisdiction that is traded between the two countries, in addition to their ongoing work on fresh produce.

We are dedicated to helping ensure the safety of the American public through our work and the safety of all of our staff by continuing to support and strengthen a culture that prioritizes workplace safety. FDA staff across the nation work diligently to help ensure the safety of FDA-regulated products. I’ve seen this same dedication in their shared commitment to protecting each other and prioritizing safety across the agency, including our laboratories across the country. As we work together to build upon our strong safety charge, I’ve recently stood up a new cross-agency working group with support from the FDA’s senior leadership to optimize and further foster a holistic, cohesive, and collaborative safety culture. As part of their charge, the group will review our current organization structure and reporting relationships that support our safety program. This working group will explore best practices and incorporate and leverage the expertise of the existing safety councils within our agency to optimize ongoing efforts. The group will focus broadly on several areas in the safety space to include occupational safety and health, environmental safety, and laboratory safety; and will look to best practices in industry to determine if they can complement our regulatory organization. This effort is meant to strengthen the already robust safety measures that staff and senior leadership have implemented. I look forward to continuing my work with the FDA’s senior leadership to bolster an already strong culture of safety and security within the agency. As part of this broader safety effort, this new working group will also work to support ongoing safety initiatives at the FDA’s laboratories. We are committed to ensuring laboratory safety to protect our personnel and their research. To accomplish this important task, each center and office will continue to work collaboratively with the FDA’s Office of Laboratory Safety (OLS) to safeguard strong laboratory safety and security, and other laboratory-related environmental and occupational safety and health programs. This structure helps to leverage knowledge and experience from different laboratories, centers and offices at the agency to identify areas across the FDA that may benefit from agency-wide safety updates. It also creates a flexible model that can be adapted to reflect the diversity of research programs and potential hazards and risks that may be unique to specific programs or centers. Work carried out by the FDA experts at these laboratories is integral in informing regulatory decision-making and policy development, as well as in supporting efforts to help facilitate the development and availability of innovative, safe and effective medical products and a safe food supply. The FDA’s laboratories house more than 2,500 researchers and analysts, whose work contributes to the development of new approaches, standards, and methods for evaluating the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of the diverse and complex products we regulate. Across the FDA, laboratory facilities help advance the work that we do to support our regulatory mission, from facilitating development of safe and effective medical and veterinary products to helping ensure the safety of the American food supply. Recently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued several recommendations in a report to the FDA surrounding laboratory safety. We plan to use the input from this GAO study, along with the results of a multi-phase effort led by the agency’s Office of Planning and Evaluation, to update the current OLS Strategic Plan, which will further ensure the success of a strong laboratory safety program. Assessing and revising that plan is a key component to assuring continuous improvements and operational efficiency in FDA laboratory safety. The OLS Strategic Plan includes an iterative process to help ensure that laboratory work processes and roles are reviewed, improved and revised as needed to ensure that the agency continues to stand ready to address public health challenges. Throughout the past months, as our agency has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have seen the pivotal role many of our laboratories have played in responding, and I’m committed to ensuring that our laboratories continue to have the full support of FDA leadership to maintain this high level of excellence. Safety and a commitment to scientific excellence remain at the core of the FDA’s mission and guide our work at our scientific research and analytical facilities and across all of our programs.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Treatment for Ebola Virus", "date": "October 14, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn), a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies, as the first FDA-approved treatment for (Ebola virus) infection in adult and pediatric patients. , commonly known as Ebola virus, is one of four species that can cause a potentially fatal human disease. Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, body fluids and tissues of infected people or wild animals, as well as with surfaces and materials, such as bedding and clothing, contaminated with these fluids. Individuals who provide care for people with Ebola virus, including health care workers who do not use correct infection control precautions, are at the highest risk for infection. Inmazeb targets the glycoprotein that is on the surface of Ebola virus. Glycoprotein attaches to the cell receptor and fuses the viral and host cell membranes allowing the virus to enter the cell. The three antibodies that make up Inmazeb can bind to this glycoprotein simultaneously and block attachment and entry of the virus. Inmazeb was evaluated in 382 adult and pediatric patients with confirmed infection in one clinical trial (the PALM trial) and as part of an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an Ebola virus outbreak in 2018-2019. The PALM trial was led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the DRC’s Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale with contributions from several other international organizations and agencies. In the PALM trial, the safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, in which 154 patients received Inmazeb (50 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenously as a single infusion, and 168 patients received an investigational control. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day mortality. The primary analysis population was all patients who were randomized and concurrently eligible to receive either Inmazeb or the investigational control during the same time period of the trial. Of the 154 patients who received Inmazeb, 33.8% died after 28 days, compared to 51% of the 153 patients who received a control. In the expanded access program, an additional 228 patients received Inmazeb. The most common symptoms experienced while receiving Inmazeb included: fever, chills, tachycardia (fast heart rate), tachypnea (fast breathing), and vomiting; however, these are also common symptoms of Ebola virus infection. Patients who receive Inmazeb should avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine due to the treatment’s potential to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Ebola virus infection and possibly reduce the vaccine’s efficacy. Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related events, can occur in patients taking Inmazeb, and treatment should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

{"title": "FDA Warns that Using a Type of Pain and Fever Medication in Second Half of Pregnancy Could Lead to Complications ", "date": "October 15, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today in a that it is requiring labeling changes for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These changes include new labeling to explain that if women take the medications around 20 weeks or later in their pregnancy, the drugs can cause rare but serious kidney problems in the unborn baby, which can lead to low levels of amniotic fluid (the protective cushion surrounding the unborn baby) and the potential for pregnancy-related complications. NSAIDs include medicines such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and celecoxib. People have taken these drugs for decades to treat pain and fever from many medical conditions. There are both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs. The medications work by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the body that cause inflammation. Aspirin also is an NSAID; however, these recommendations do not apply to the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg). Low-dose aspirin may be an important treatment for some women during pregnancy and should be taken under the direction of a health care professional. As noted in the Drug Safety Communication, the warning follows the FDA’s review of the medical literature and cases reported to the agency about low amniotic fluid levels or kidney problems in unborn babies associated with NSAID use during pregnancy. After about 20 weeks of pregnancy, the unborn baby’s kidneys begin producing most of the amniotic fluid, so fetal kidney problems can cause low levels of this fluid. Low levels of amniotic fluid, a condition known as oligohydramnios, may be detected after taking the medicine for days or weeks, but it may be detected as soon as two days after initiation of regular NSAID use. This condition usually goes away if the pregnant woman stops taking the NSAID. For prescription NSAIDs, the FDA is requiring changes to the prescribing information to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid and to recommend that NSAID use be limited between about 20 weeks to 30 weeks of pregnancy because of this risk. Warnings to avoid taking NSAIDs after about 30 weeks of pregnancy are already included in the prescribing information because taking these medications during this time may lead to heart issues in the unborn baby. If a health care provider believes NSAID use is necessary between about 20 and 30 weeks of pregnancy, use should be limited to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. The manufacturers of OTC NSAIDs intended for adult use will also make similar updates to the Although certain health care providers treating pregnant women generally know about the risk of low levels of amniotic fluid, the FDA is communicating this information more broadly to educate other health care professionals and pregnant women.

The draft guidance of this document was issued in 2019. “As new information has become available about the risks and complications of breast implants, it is critical that women have access to information they need to make informed decisions,” said Binita Ashar, M.D., Director of the Office of Surgical and Infection Control Devices in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “After working with stakeholders, including patients, today we are recommending format and content changes to breast implant labeling so the information is presented in an easy to understand way. It is important that patients discuss the risks and benefits of breast implants with their health care provider and we hope that these labeling recommendations will help in facilitating these discussions.” Over the past several years, the FDA has received new information pertaining to risks associated with breast implants, including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and systemic symptoms commonly referred to as breast implant illness (BII) that some patients attribute to their implants, which can include fatigue, “brain fog,” muscle or joint pain and rash. The FDA has taken a number of steps to better understand and address risks associated with breast implants, including convening the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Advisory Panel in 2019 to discuss the long-term benefits and risks of breast implants indicated for breast augmentation and reconstruction. The meeting covered a range of important topics on breast implant safety, including characterization of BIA-ALCL incidence and risk factors, and methods for assessing systemic symptoms. The Panel gave recommendations on these topics, including recommending that FDA require a boxed warning in breast implant labeling and a standardized checklist as part of the informed consent process, revise the MRI screening recommendations for silent ruptures of silicone gel-filled breast implants and provide greater transparency regarding materials present in breast implants. The Panel also discussed the role of the patient device card in providing important information about the patient’s breast implant. The final guidance issued today provides recommendations for manufacturers to incorporate a boxed warning and a patient decision checklist into the labeling for breast implants to better ensure certain information is received and understood by patients. This guidance also recommends updated and additional labeling information, including updates to the silicone gel-filled breast implant rupture screening recommendations, inclusion of an easy-to-find description of materials and provision of patient device cards that were recommended at the March 2019 Panel meeting. These labeling recommendations are intended to enhance, but not replace, discussions between doctors and patients to talk about the benefits and risks of breast implants that relate to individual patients.

As outlined in the letter of intent and in the recently signed MOU, the FDA, CBP, and ICE-HSI will expand the types of information and how that information is shared among the agencies to quickly and effectively identify trends in incoming violative packages. This collaboration involves sharing of both general and specific data points, which can be used to target impending product entries and to inform future enforcement strategies. An additional focus of this effort will be coordinating shared space as well as increased scientific presence at high-volume IMF locations, helping to facilitate and support real-time entry decisions and increased data sharing. Since April 2016, when the FDA implemented its administrative destruction authority at all nine IMFs, the agency has destroyed more than 12.9 million capsules/tablets/pieces – weighing over 41.2 tons. The destruction of almost 13 million violative drug units by the FDA represents a key component of the agency’s public health mission, as these potentially dangerous drugs were destined for over 31,000 U.S. consumers. New authorities and resources provided by Congress under the have enabled the FDA to create a more efficient destruction process for violative drugs containing certain active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and to expand its presence at IMF locations nationwide, which has resulted in more rapid, on-site scientific support, increased staffing and improved work facilities.

A recent directed the agency, in consultation with federal partners, to identify a of essential medicines, medical countermeasures and critical inputs that are medically necessary to have available at all times in an amount adequate to serve patient needs and in the appropriate dosage forms. The goal of this work is to ensure the American public is protected against outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. To accomplish this goal, the executive order seeks to ensure sufficient and reliable, long-term domestic production of these products, and to minimize potential shortages by reducing our dependence on foreign manufacturers of these products. Over the past several weeks, the FDA has worked, in consultation with other federal partners, to develop a list of 227 drug and biological product essential medicines and medical countermeasures. Additionally, 96 device medical countermeasures are included on the list. These devices include diagnostic testing kits and supplies for rapid test development and processing, personal protective equipment, active vital sign monitoring devices, devices for vaccine delivery and devices for management of acute illnesses such as ventilators, among others. Generally, the essential medicines we identified are those that are most needed for patients in U.S. acute care medical facilities, which specialize in short-term treatment for severe injuries or illnesses, and urgent medical conditions. The medical countermeasures we identified are FDA-regulated products (biologics, drugs and devices) that meet the definition of a “medical countermeasure” provided in the executive order and that we anticipate will be needed to respond to future pandemics, epidemics, and chemical, biological and radiological/nuclear threats. When identifying essential medicines and medical countermeasures, we focused on including those that are medically necessary to have available in adequate supply which can be used for the widest populations to have the greatest potential impact on public health. The critical inputs we identified include active pharmaceutical ingredients of essential medicines and medical countermeasures, as well as ingredients or components that possess unique attributes essential in assessing the safety and effectiveness of such products. More information on the list, as well as an opportunity to submit comment, is available through The executive order also directs the FDA to coordinate with our federal partners on a number of additional issues, including strategies for acquiring the products on the list, accelerating domestic manufacturing and identifying and addressing supply chain vulnerabilities. The FDA is working on this coordination. The FDA believes that the adoption of innovative technologies, such as techniques could enable U.S.-based pharmaceutical manufacturing to bolster its competitiveness with foreign countries and help ensure a stable supply of drugs critical to the health of U.S. patients. As companies look to increase domestic manufacturing of the products on this list, we encourage them to consider adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. The FDA will continue to collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal partners on this issue as directed by the executive order.

The 770G System is a first-of-a-kind device for patients aged 2 to 6 years. It is the first legally marketed device that can automatically adjust insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitor values for this patient population. Patients with Type 1 diabetes, or their caregivers, must consistently monitor their glucose levels throughout the day and inject insulin with a syringe, pen or pump to maintain adequate glucose levels in order to avoid becoming hyperglycemic (high glucose levels) or hypoglycemic (low glucose levels). The MiniMed 770G System, a bluetooth-enabled version of the previously approved MiniMed 670G System (with other modifications), is a hybrid closed loop system that works by measuring glucose levels in the body every five minutes and automatically adjusting insulin delivery by either administering or withholding insulin. The system includes: a sensor that attaches to the body to measure glucose levels under the skin; an insulin pump strapped to the body; and an infusion patch connected to the pump with a catheter that delivers insulin. While the device automatically adjusts insulin levels, users need to manually request insulin doses to counter carbohydrate consumption at mealtime. The FDA evaluated data from a clinical trial that included 46 children aged 2 to 6 years old with type 1 diabetes.  Study participants wore the device for approximately three months to evaluate the performance of the device during both the at-home periods, as well as a hotel period, to stress the system with sustained daily exercise. That study found no serious adverse events and that the device is safe for use. Data from that study was used to help support the expanded indication for patients 2 to 6 years old. Risks associated with use of the system may include hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, as well as skin irritation or redness around the device’s infusion patch. As part of this approval, the FDA is requiring the device manufacturer to conduct a post-market study to evaluate device performance in real-world settings in children between the ages of 2 and 6. This device is not approved for use in children younger than 2 years old and in individuals who require less than eight units of insulin per day. The approval of the MiniMed 770G hybrid closed loop system was granted to Medtronic.

{"title": "FDA Provides Guidance to Industry for Detecting and Preventing Nitrosamines in Drugs", "date": "September 01, 2020", "contents": " Since the outset of our discovery of impurities called nitrosamines in some types of drugs more than two years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has undertaken a thorough investigation in an effort to protect patients. While nitrosamines are common in water and foods, nitrosamine impurities may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels and over long periods of time. For this reason, the discovery of unexpected nitrosamine impurities in some drug products is a serious concern, and the FDA has been working, in collaboration with regulatory counterparts around the world, to find and remove drugs with unacceptable nitrosamine impurities from the U.S. drug supply. As we do so, we’re also taking proactive efforts to help ensure that in the future, drugs can be free from unsafe levels of these impurities from the start of production. Ensuring that drugs are safe, effective and high-quality is a critical part of FDA’s mission. In our continued efforts to be transparent and provide guidance to manufacturers on how to detect and prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamine impurities, today we’re publishing our guidance for immediate implementation. This guidance recommends steps, including a comprehensive risk assessment strategy and other actions that manufacturers can take to reduce or prevent the presence of nitrosamine impurities in their drugs. There are many reasons why these impurities might appear in some drugs, and consequently many approaches to screening for and preventing the appearance of nitrosamines to help ensure drug quality and safety. The source of these impurities can be related to the drug’s manufacturing process, the materials used in manufacturing, the drugs’ chemical structure, or even the conditions in which drugs are stored or packaged. Under FDA’s oversight, manufacturers are responsible for mitigating these impurities. The most common nitrosamine impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), is found at low levels in water and foods, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. The FDA and the international scientific community do not expect NDMA to cause harm when ingested at low levels. However, given the risk that genotoxic substances such as NDMA may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above certain levels and over long periods of time, manufacturers have recalled drugs with NDMA levels higher than the FDA’s recommended acceptable intake levels. Patients taking medications with potential nitrosamine impurities should not stop taking their medications and should talk with their health care professional about concerns and other treatment options. We believe that the guidance we’ve issued today will assist manufacturers in preventing unacceptable levels of nitrosamines in drugs. Protecting patients is the FDA’s highest priority, and we will continue to work with manufacturers and our international regulatory partners to investigate and definitively resolve this problem.

{"title": "FDA Announces Key FSMA Rule to Advance Traceability of Foods, A Major Milestone in the New Era of Smarter Food Safety ", "date": "September 21, 2020", "contents": " Today, I am excited to announce an important, critical step forward in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s efforts to bring about farm-to-table traceability in our food supply. The FDA has that lays the foundation for the end-to-end food traceability across the food industry that we’ll be working toward over the next decade as part of the New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative. When we say traceability, what we are really talking about is the ability to track a food at every step of the supply chain. While limited to certain foods, this proposed rule would create a first-of-its-kind standardized approach to traceability recordkeeping, paving the way for industry to adopt and leverage more digital, tech-enabled traceability systems both in the near term and the future. We are also releasing a draft that identifies foods to which the additional recordkeeping requirements would apply. Congress recognized the need for greater traceability in the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). FSMA section 204, , instructs the FDA to develop additional recordkeeping requirements for certain foods to help establish clear tracing of a food product’s source when needed to address food safety risks. This proposed rule, when finalized, would implement this key component of the landmark food safety law. We recognize that to fully realize the public health benefits envisioned by FSMA, we need to continue to improve our ability to rapidly and accurately identify foods that may be causing illness, and this rulemaking is part of that. When FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and I announced the New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint in July, this proposed rule was presented as the first step in our work to advance traceability. We want to help protect consumers by more quickly identifying the source of contaminated products, limiting the scope of recalls, and reducing the risk of illness or death. Advancing traceability will also greatly facilitate timelier root-cause investigations to learn more about how contamination occurs in order to prevent future outbreaks. Consumers don’t normally think of as being a means of preventing foodborne illness, but like many of the improvements in food safety over the years, such as whole genome sequencing, what we are proposing today has a direct impact on preventing foodborne illness. More comprehensive traceability through access to records of key data elements associated with critical tracking events in food production and distribution has the potential to help us pinpoint the exact sources of foods involved in outbreaks. Not only does this help us to remove potentially unsafe products from the market more quickly, preventing additional illness or death, but it also helps us to conduct root cause investigations to figure out what went wrong leading to the outbreak. Without knowing the source of a contaminated food is extremely hard, if not impossible, for us to fully diagnose the problem and work with industry to develop and implement strategies to prevent similar issues in the future. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness tied to fresh produce like leafy greens and papayas, among others, highlight the importance of this work. Today’s food system has changed as the way our society operates changes, creating a complex and globally connected landscape that changes how food moves through supply chains. When we look at the current state of traceability across the food supply, we find that even though some food producers, manufacturers and retailers have adopted modern, effective traceability systems, rarely are these systems compatible with each other. And still, many other food companies have not adopted traceability systems at all. Simply put, we lack a harmonized system of traceability from farm to fork that is universally understood and utilized. This means that during an outbreak investigation, our ability to rapidly track and trace specific food products through the supply chain is often impeded by a lack of data. The result can be millions of dollars in avoidable product loss by necessitating overly broad recalls and consumer advisories, a loss of consumer trust, and prolonged outbreaks of consumer illnesses and deaths. We conducted extensive research in developing this proposed rule and chose an approach that would standardize the data elements and information companies must establish and maintain, along with information they must send to the next entity in the supply chain. We took into consideration the existing standards that some firms and industry groups have already adopted, and when possible, we have strived to make the proposed requirements compatible with those standards. We look forward to hearing comments on the proposed rule, including perspectives from different parts of the supply chain and businesses of different sizes. We will consider the submitted comments as we work to finalize this proposed rule. The approach we have laid out in the proposed rule would allow us to better establish linkages throughout the supply chain during a foodborne illness outbreak investigation and more quickly identify potential sources of contamination and prevent additional illness and death. The availability of the traceability records that are set out in the proposed rule would also help limit the scope of recalls and in some instances, allow the FDA to better target consumer advice, avoiding blanket alerts on whole commodity sectors. For instance, in some past leafy green outbreaks, the FDA has had to call for all romaine lettuce to be removed from the marketplace when the available supply chain information could not pinpoint a specific entity that produced the lettuce linked to the illnesses. With this proposed rule, we’re hoping to avoid situations like this in the future. I am excited to continue collaborating with stakeholders as we work to finalize this rule, and further enhance traceability. We are encouraging you to be involved in this process by commenting on the proposed rule. We look forward to announcing public meetings to discuss this proposed rule with everyone interested in food safety and value input from all stakeholders during the comment period. Working together, we will advance food traceability and usher in a New Era of Smarter Food Safety that benefits producers and consumers."},
{"title": "FDA Issues Recommendations for Certain High-Risk Groups Regarding Mercury-Containing Dental Amalgam ", "date": "September 24, 2020", "contents": " Part of our role in protecting patients is to regularly evaluate, monitor and update scientific evidence on the risks from medical devices—including issues related to the materials used in devices, such as metals. In the case of implanted and inserted medical devices, where materials may be in contact with the body for extended periods of time, we evaluate safety issues involved with, among other things, the body’s long-term exposure to certain materials, taking into account that sometimes uncertainties remain and more research is needed. Today, the FDA is issuing updated recommendations concerning dental amalgam and potential risks to certain high-risk individuals that may be associated with these mercury-containing fillings used to restore the missing structure and surfaces of a decayed tooth. The FDA has found that certain groups may be at greater risk for potential harmful health effects of mercury vapor released from the device. As a result, the agency is recommending certain high-risk groups avoid getting dental amalgam whenever possible and appropriate. These groups that may be at a greater risk for potential harmful health effects include: For over 20 years, the FDA has been reviewing scientific literature, monitoring reports and holding public discussions regarding the public health effects of dental amalgam and amalgam-related mercury vapor. Dental amalgam is a mixture of mercury and a powdered alloy made up of silver, tin and copper. The amalgam releases small amounts of mercury vapor over time. While low-levels of inhaled mercury vapor are generally not harmful to most people, these high-risk individuals may be at increased risk of adverse health outcomes. How much vapor is released can also depend on the age of the filling as well as a person’s habits such as teeth grinding. These uncertainties in the most vulnerable patients are why today we are recommending people who may be at high risk for adverse health effects of mercury exposure use non-mercury , such as composite resins and glass ionomer cement fillings. Dental amalgam-related mercury vapor release may be highest during placement or removal of the filling. The FDA is not recommending anyone remove or replace existing amalgam fillings in good condition unless it is considered medically necessary because removing intact amalgam fillings can cause a temporary increase in exposure to mercury vapor and the potential loss of healthy tooth structure, potentially resulting in more risks than benefits. While the available evidence suggests that dental amalgam use has generally declined over recent years, due to more alternative products being offered and used effectively for dental restorations, high-risk individuals, as noted in our recommendations, should discuss alternative products for restoring teeth with their dentist. Our reviews and discussions have generally arrived at the same conclusion: while the majority of evidence suggests exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgam fillings doesn’t lead to harmful health effects for most people, there may be some effects in people with certain health issues such as those who are hypersensitive to mercury. Uncertainties remain about: the effects that long-term exposure to dental amalgam may have on the specific high-risk groups we’ve listed above; the potential for mercury in dental amalgam to convert to other mercury compounds in the body; and whether the accumulation of mercury in some body fluids and tissues results in other unintended health outcomes. We have made these recommendations after hearing from health care professionals, evaluating published literature and considering the public’s comments about dental amalgam and other metal-containing implants. During the , which discussed immunological responses to metal-containing implants and dental amalgam, we heard from several speakers, including those representing underserved communities, who expressed concern about the cumulative effect of mercury vapor exposure from dental amalgam, as well as from other (dietary and environmental) sources. The FDA continues to believe that the benefits of materials in FDA-approved or cleared implantable and insertable medical devices outweigh their risks for most patients. However, we recognize that it is critical to closely monitor and evaluate new benefit-risk related data as biomedical science is always evolving. We continue to gather input from patients, device manufacturers, researchers and physicians to learn more about their experiences, ideas and feedback related to materials in medical devices, such as dental amalgam. We’re committed to advancing new initiatives that are rooted in sound science with a focus on patient safety remaining at the forefront.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First Point-of-Care Antibody Test for COVID-19", "date": "September 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the first serology (antibody) point-of-care (POC) test for COVID-19. The Assure COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device was first authorized for emergency use by certain labs in July 2020 to help identify individuals with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior COVID-19 infection. Today, that EUA is to authorize the test for POC use using fingerstick blood samples. This authorization means that fingerstick blood samples can now be tested in POC settings like doctor’s offices, hospitals, urgent care centers and emergency rooms rather than having to be sent to a central lab for testing. Nearly 50 serology tests have been granted an EUA since the start of the pandemic. The Assure test is a lateral flow assay and is authorized for use with venous whole blood, serum, plasma and fingerstick whole blood. This serology POC test, unlike POC COVID-19 diagnostic tests, uses a blood sample from the fingertip to run the test. The FDA wants to remind patients that it is unknown how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of antibodies confers protective immunity, so they should not interpret results from a serology test as telling them they are immune, or have any level of immunity, from the virus. Due to these unknowns, the FDA cautions patients against using the results from these tests, or any serology test, as an indication that they can stop taking steps to protect themselves and others, such as stopping social distancing, discontinuing wearing masks or returning to work. The FDA also wants to remind the public that serology tests should not be used to diagnose an active infection, as they only detect antibodies the immune system develops in response to the virus – not the virus itself. It is also important to remember that in a population with low prevalence, even high-performing antibody tests may produce as many or more false results as true results because the likelihood of finding someone who has been infected is very small. Thus, it is necessary to consider that the results from two serology tests may be needed to generate reliable results. The Assure COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device is currently the only FDA authorized COVID-19 POC serology test and is available by prescription only.

{"title": "FDA Requiring Labeling Changes for Benzodiazepines", "date": "September 23, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today in a that it is requiring an update to the Boxed Warning, the agency’s most prominent safety warning, and requiring class-wide labeling changes for benzodiazepines to include the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence and withdrawal reactions to help improve their safe use. In 2019, an estimated 92 million benzodiazepine prescriptions were dispensed from U.S. outpatient pharmacies, with alprazolam (38%) being the most common followed by clonazepam (24%) and lorazepam (20%). In 2018, an estimated 50% of patients dispensed oral benzodiazepines received them for two months or longer. Most benzodiazepines are recommended for use for periods of weeks or months. Benzodiazepines are important approved treatment options for generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, seizures, social phobia and panic disorder. They are also used as premedication before some medical procedures. The dose, frequency and duration of treatment vary depending on the patient, the particular benzodiazepine being prescribed and the medical condition that the drug is being used to treat. Physical dependence can occur when benzodiazepines are taken steadily for several days to weeks. Patients who have been taking a benzodiazepine for weeks or months can have withdrawal signs and symptoms when the medicine is discontinued abruptly or continued in lower doses to avoid withdrawal. Stopping benzodiazepines abruptly or reducing the dosage too quickly can result in acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Prior to stopping benzodiazepines, patients should talk to their health care provider to develop a plan for slowly tapering the medication. In addition to requiring an update to the Boxed Warning, the FDA is requiring other changes to the Warnings and Precautions, Drug Abuse and Dependence and Patient Counseling Information sections of the prescribing information for all benzodiazepine products. The agency is also requiring revisions to the existing patient Medication Guides for these medicines to help educate patients and caregivers about these risks. This action is part of the FDA’s ongoing effort to promote the public health by minimizing risks associated with inappropriate use of controlled substances while enabling appropriate access to these products for medical use.

These actions reflect key strategic international engagement and several years of careful review by the FDA on behalf of consumers at home and abroad,” said Anna Abram, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation and International Affairs. “Today we’re helping unlock economic opportunity by creating a path forward to new market access for U.S. exporters.” The equivalence determination finalizes the proposed determination that the FDA published in the Federal Register in 2018 and is a result of a multi-year, in-depth review of EU shellfish safety controls implemented in Spain and the Netherlands. Technical experts on both sides of the Atlantic have completed separate equivalence assessments and each side recommended a finding of equivalence after reviewing food safety control measures for molluscan shellfish and on-site audits to verify the other’s systems. The FDA will recognize other EU Member States in the future, as appropriate, in separate determinations. “Today we’re making a wider selection of healthy and safe seafood options available to the American consumer from Europe,” said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response. “Americans can be confident in the equivalence determination that Spain and the Netherlands have implemented safety controls that are equivalent to ours, thereby enabling us to allow Spain and the Netherlands to export raw molluscan shellfish to the U.S. The FDA is committed to keeping consumers safe and ensuring the safety of our food supply, and that includes seafood, whether it is imported or harvested domestically.” In a separate action, the European Commission has also made a food safety equivalence determination that will permit raw and processed molluscan shellfish, including clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, to be imported from the United States, beginning with shellfish from Massachusetts and Washington.

The for industry describes procedures drug manufacturers can follow to facilitate importation of prescription drugs, including biological products, that are FDA-approved, manufactured abroad, authorized for sale in any foreign country, and originally intended for sale in that foreign country. The rule allows states (including the District of Columbia and territories), Indian tribes and — in certain future circumstances — pharmacists and wholesalers, to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. An importation program can be co-sponsored by a state, Indian tribe, pharmacist or wholesaler. Referred to as Section 804 Importation Programs, these programs will be managed by the respective sponsor and any co-sponsors and authorized by the FDA to facilitate the importation of certain prescription drugs that are approved in Canada and, with appropriate labeling, meet the conditions of an FDA-approved drug application. Eligible prescription drugs would have to be relabeled with the required U.S. labeling and undergo testing for authenticity, degradation and to ensure that the drugs meet established specifications and standards. These programs will also have to demonstrate significant cost reductions of the covered products to the American consumer. The final guidance issued today describes procedures for a drug manufacturer to obtain a National Drug Code (NDC) for certain FDA-approved prescription drugs, including biological products and combination products, that were originally manufactured and intended for sale in that foreign country. The use of an additional NDC for these products may allow greater flexibility for drug companies to offer these products at a lower price than what their current distribution contracts require. Prescription drugs, including biological products, imported under the pathway described in the final guidance could be available to patients in a variety of settings, including hospitals, health care providers’ offices or licensed pharmacies, and would include the FDA-approved labeling (including prescribing information).

The new indication for Nucala is the first approval for HES patients in nearly 14 years. said Ann Farrell, M.D., director of the Division of Nonmalignant Hematology in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. HES is a heterogeneous group of rare disorders associated with persistent eosinophilia (higher than normal levels of a type of disease-fighting white blood cell) with evidence of organ damage. Symptoms include skin rashes, itching, asthma, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, arthritis, muscle inflammation, congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) and anemia. Nucala was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial in 108 patients with HES. In the study, patients were randomly assigned to receive Nucala or placebo by injection every four weeks. The trial compared the proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during the 32-week treatment period. A HES flare was defined as worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of HES or increasing eosinophils (disease-fighting white blood cells) on at least two occasions. The trial compared the proportions of patients with at least one flare over a 32-week treatment period, as well as the time to the first flare. Fewer patients in the Nucala treatment group (28%) had HES flares compared to patients in the placebo group (56%), with a 50% relative reduction. In addition, the time to the first HES flare was later, on average, for patients treated with Nucala vs. placebo. The most common side effects of Nucala in patients with HES include: upper respiratory tract infection and pain in extremities (such as the hands, legs and feet). Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or one of its ingredients. Herpes zoster (shingles) infections have occurred in patients receiving Nucala. Health care providers should consider vaccination if medically appropriate.

This simple design is fast and efficient for healthcare providers and patients and does not need the use of an analyzer. A healthcare provider swabs the patient’s nose and twirls that sample on a test card with a testing reagent added. After waiting 15 minutes, the healthcare provider reads the results directly from the testing card. One line indicates a negative result; two lines indicate a positive result. This test could be used at point-of-care settings, like a doctor’s office, emergency room or some schools.  This test has been authorized for use in patients suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within seven days of symptom onset. Given the simple nature of this test, it is likely that these tests could be made broadly available. According to the test manufacturer, Abbott, it plans to make up to 50 million tests available monthly in the U.S. at the beginning of October 2020. In general, antigen tests are very specific, but are not as sensitive as molecular tests. Due to the potential for decreased sensitivity compared to molecular assays, negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with a molecular test prior to making treatment decisions. Negative results from an antigen test should be considered in the context of clinical observations, patient history and epidemiological information.

As noted in the initial issuance of the EUA, the emergency use of Veklury was limited to those patients with severe disease, which was defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator. Today, based on the Agency’s ongoing review of the EUA, including its review of the totality of scientific information now available, the FDA has determined that it is reasonable to believe Veklury may be effective for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in all hospitalized adult and pediatric patients. The Agency’s review has also concluded that the known and potential benefits of Veklury outweigh the known and potential risks for these uses. Under the law, the FDA may revise an emergency use authorization, as appropriate, based on additional public health considerations, such as new data. Based on the Agency’s ongoing review of the EUA for Veklury, including its review of the totality of scientific information now available, the Agency is revising the EUA to expand the scope of the authorized uses to include the treatment of hospitalized adult and pediatric patients, irrespective of their disease severity. The expansion of the scope of the EUA to include hospitalized patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 is supported by the Agency’s analysis of additional data from two randomized, controlled clinical trials that included patients with mild or moderate disease. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (ACTT-1), conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, evaluated how long it took for subjects to recover from COVID-19 within 29 days of being treated. The trial looked at 1,062 hospitalized subjects with mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 who received Veklury (n=541) or placebo (n=521), plus standard of care. Recovery was defined as either being discharged from the hospital or being hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery from COVID-19 was 10 days for the Veklury group compared to 15 days for the placebo group, a statistically significant difference. Overall, the odds of clinical improvement at Day 15 were also statistically significantly higher in the Veklury group when compared to the placebo group. In hospitalized patients with mild to moderate disease, the results for time to recovery as well as the odds of improvement at Day 15 numerically favored the Veklury group and were consistent with the overall study results. A separate randomized, open-label multi-center (Study GS-US-540-5774) of hospitalized adult subjects with moderate COVID-19 compared treatment with Veklury for five days (n=191) and treatment with Veklury for 10 days (n=193) with standard of care (n=200). Researchers evaluated the clinical status of subjects on Day 11. Overall, the odds of a subject’s COVID-19 symptoms improving were statistically significantly higher in the five-day Veklury group at Day 11 when compared to those receiving only standard of care. The odds of improvement with the 10-day treatment group when compared to those receiving only standard of care were numerically favorable, but not statistically significantly different. At Day 28, mortality was less than or equal to 2 percent in all treatment groups. Limitations of this trial included the open-label design. Important information about using Veklury in treating COVID-19 is available in , which include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions.

The tables show the Limit of Detection (LoD) of more than 55 authorized molecular diagnostic COVID-19 tests against a standardized sample panel provided by the FDA. The FDA provided these standardized samples, known as a reference panel, to test developers who are required to assess their test’s performance against this panel (or other FDA-recommended reference materials) as a condition of their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). “By providing this panel to both commercial and laboratory test developers and evaluating the data we receive, we are able to gain valuable insight into the comparative performance of different authorized molecular diagnostic tests under the same conditions,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Reference panels can be used in many ways to support test development and authorization, but most importantly, they are a powerful tool in monitoring test performance and ensuring that Americans have access to diagnostics they can trust.” The FDA began distributing the reference panel of samples in May and has provided it to more than 150 developers as a resource in the development and validation of accurate and reliable diagnostic tests. In order to ensure accuracy of test results using the reference panel, the FDA did not disclose the amount of viral material in the samples, resulting in a blind test for developers. In the data published today, a lower LoD represents a test’s ability to detect a smaller amount of viral material in a given sample, signaling a more sensitive test. However, the data does not indicate how sensitive a particular test is, and, therefore, cannot be used by itself to determine whether to authorize a test or other regulatory action. Instead, the data gives laboratories, healthcare providers and patients a new resource on the relative performance of available tests to better inform which tests they choose to use.

{"title": "FDA Issues Emergency Use Authorization for Convalescent Plasma as Potential Promising COVID–19 Treatment, Another Achievement in Administration’s Fight Against Pandemic", "date": "August 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for investigational convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to fight COVID-19. Based on scientific evidence available, the FDA concluded, as outlined in its , this product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. Today’s action follows the FDA’s extensive review of the science and data generated over the past several months stemming from efforts to facilitate emergency access to convalescent plasma for patients as clinical trials to definitively demonstrate safety and efficacy remain ongoing. The EUA authorizes the distribution of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the U.S. and its administration by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. “The FDA’s emergency authorization for convalescent plasma is a milestone achievement in President Trump’s efforts to save lives from COVID-19,” said Secretary Azar. “The Trump Administration recognized the potential of convalescent plasma early on. Months ago, the FDA, BARDA, and private partners began work on making this product available across the country while continuing to evaluate data through clinical trials. Our work on convalescent plasma has delivered broader access to the product than is available in any other country and reached more than 70,000 American patients so far. We are deeply grateful to Americans who have already donated and encourage individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to consider donating convalescent plasma.” “I am committed to releasing safe and potentially helpful treatments for COVID-19 as quickly as possible in order to save lives. We’re encouraged by the early promising data that we’ve seen about convalescent plasma. The data from studies conducted this year shows that plasma from patients who’ve recovered from COVID-19 has the potential to help treat those who are suffering from the effects of getting this terrible virus,” said Dr. Hahn. “At the same time, we will continue to work with researchers to continue randomized clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating patients infected with the novel coronavirus.” Based on an evaluation of the and the totality of the available scientific evidence, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research determined that the statutory criteria for issuing an EUA criteria were met. The FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in lessening the severity or shortening the length of COVID-19 illness in some hospitalized patients. The agency also determined that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product and that that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative treatments. The EUA is not intended to replace randomized clinical trials and facilitating the enrollment of patients into any of the ongoing randomized clinical trials is critically important for the definitive demonstration of safety and efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. The FDA continues to recommend that the designs of ongoing randomized clinical trials of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and other therapeutic agents remain unaltered, as COVID-19 convalescent plasma does not yet represent a new standard of care based on the current available evidence. The EUA requires that fact sheets providing important information about using COVID-19 convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 be made available to , including dosing instructions and potential side effects. Possible side effects of COVID-19 convalescent plasma include allergic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and transfusion associated lung injury, as well as the potential for transfusion-transmitted infections. The FDA initially facilitated access to convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 by using pathways that included traditional clinical trials and emergency single-patient investigational new drug (IND) applications. for convalescent plasma was initiated in early April to fill an urgent need to provide patient access to a medical product of possible benefit during a time that the FDA was working with researchers to facilitate the initiation of randomized clinical trials to study convalescent plasma. As the number of single patient IND requests started to number in the hundreds on a daily basis, the FDA worked collaboratively with industry, academic, and government partners to implement an expanded access protocol to provide convalescent plasma to patients in need across the country via the national expanded access treatment protocol. The program was developed with funding from the HHS’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), with the Mayo Clinic serving as the lead institution. To date, the program has facilitated the infusion of over 70,000 patients with convalescent plasma. was issued to the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The EUA remains in effect until the termination of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

SalivaDirect does not require any special type of swab or collection device; a saliva sample can be collected in any sterile container. This test is also unique because it does not require a separate nucleic acid extraction step. This is significant because the extraction kits used for this step in other tests have been prone to shortages in the past. Being able to perform a test without these kits enhances the capacity for increased testing, while reducing the strain on available resources. Additionally, the SalivaDirect methodology has been validated and authorized for use with different combinations of commonly used reagents and instruments, meaning the test could be used broadly in most high-complexity labs. Yale intends to provide the SalivaDirect protocol to interested laboratories as an “open source” protocol, meaning that designated laboratories could follow the protocol to obtain the required components and perform the test in their lab according to Yale’s instructions for use. Because this test does not rely on any proprietary equipment from Yale and can use a variety of commercially available testing components, it can be assembled and used in high-complexity labs throughout the country, provided they comply with the conditions of authorization in the EUA. This is the fifth test that the FDA has authorized that uses saliva as a sample for testing. Testing saliva eliminates the need for nasopharyngeal swabs, which have also been prone to shortages, and alleviates the patient discomfort associated with these swabs. Since the saliva sample is self-collected under the observation of a healthcare professional, it could also potentially lower the risk posed to healthcare workers responsible for sample collection. While FDA has seen variable performance in tests using saliva, Yale School of Public Health submitted data with its EUA request from which the FDA determined that Yale’s test meets the criteria for emergency authorization when used to test saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.

{"title": "FDA Approves Treatment for Rare Disease Affecting Optic Nerves, Spinal Cord", "date": "August 17, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Enspryng (satralizumab-mwge) for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults with a particular antibody – patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 or AQP4 antibody-positive. NMOSD is a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Enspryng is the third approved treatment for the disorder. In patients with NMOSD, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and proteins in the body, most often those in the optic nerves and spinal cord. Individuals with NMOSD typically have attacks of optic neuritis, which causes eye pain and vision loss. Approximately 50% of patients with NMOSD have permanent visual impairment and paralysis caused by NMOSD attacks. Estimates vary, but NMOSD is thought to impact approximately 4,000 to 8,000 Americans. NMOSD can be associated with antibodies that bind to a protein called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Binding of the anti-AQP4 antibody appears to activate other components of the immune system, causing inflammation and damage to the central nervous system. The effectiveness and safety of Enspryng for the treatment of NMOSD was demonstrated in two 96-week clinical studies. The first study included 95 adult patients; 64 of these patients had antibodies against AQP4 (anti-AQP4 positive). During this study, treatment with Enspryng reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 74% in patients who were anti-AQP4 positive compared to treatment with a placebo (inactive treatment). The second study included 76 adult patients; 52 of these patients were anti-AQP4 positive. During the second study, treatment with Enspryng reduced the number of relapses in patients who were anti-AQP4 positive by 78% compared to treatment with a placebo. There was no evidence of a benefit in patients who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative in either trial. The prescribing information for Enspryng includes a warning for increased risk of infection, including serious and potentially fatal infections – such as potential reactivation of hepatitis B and tuberculosis. Other warnings and precautions for Enspryng include elevated liver enzymes, decreased neutrophil counts and hypersensitivity reactions. The most common side effects observed were the common cold (nasopharyngitis), headache, upper respiratory tract infection, inflammation of the lining of the stomach, rash, joint pain, extremity pain, fatigue and nausea. Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and should be administered at least four weeks before starting Enspryng.

Olinvyk is indicated for short-term intravenous use in hospitals or other controlled clinical settings, such as during inpatient and outpatient procedures. It is not indicated for at-home use. A total of 1,535 patients with moderate to severe acute pain were treated with Olinvyk in controlled and open-label trials. Its safety and efficacy were established by comparing Olinvyk to placebo in randomized, controlled studies of patients who had undergone bunion surgery or abdominal surgery. Patients administered Olinvyk reported decreased pain compared to placebo at the approved doses. The safety profile of Olinvyk is similar to other opioids. As with other opioids, the most common side effects of Olinvyk are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and constipation. Olinvyk should not be given to patients with significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction; or known hypersensitivity to the drug.

The rule pertains to foods such as soy sauce, yogurt, sauerkraut, pickles, cheese and green olives. Distilled foods, such as distilled vinegars, are also included in the final rule. The final rule adds compliance requirements for hydrolyzed or fermented foods that use the “gluten-free” labeling claim, since gluten breaks down during these processes and currently available analytical methods cannot be used to determine if these products meet the “gluten-free” definition. The rule requires manufacturers of these food products to make and keep records providing adequate assurance that: the food meets the definition of “gluten-free” before fermentation or hydrolysis; the manufacturer has adequately evaluated the potential for cross-contact with gluten during the manufacturing process; and if necessary, measures are in place to prevent the introduction of gluten into the food during the manufacturing process.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Indication for Drug Containing an Active Ingredient Derived from Cannabis to Treat Seizures in Rare Genetic Disease", "date": "July 31, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol) [CBD] oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in patients one year of age and older. Epidiolex was previously approved for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS). This is the only FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from cannabis. It is also the second FDA approval of a drug for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC. CBD is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant. However, CBD does not cause intoxication or euphoria (the “high”) that comes from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It is THC (and not CBD) that is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. “The FDA continues to believe the drug approval process represents the best way to make new medicines, including any drugs derived from cannabis, available to patients in need of appropriate medical therapy such as the treatment of seizures associated with these rare conditions. This paradigm ensures new therapies are safe, effective, and manufactured to a high quality that provides uniform and reliable dosing for patients,” said Douglas Throckmorton, M.D., deputy center director for regulatory programs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The agency is committed to supporting rigorous scientific research on the potential medical uses of cannabis-derived products and working with product developers who are interested in bringing patients safe and effective, high quality products.” that causes non-cancerous (benign) tumors to grow in the brain and other parts of the body like the eyes, heart, kidneys, lungs, and skin. TSC usually affects the central nervous system and can result in a combination of symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, and behavioral problems, although the signs and symptoms of the condition, as well as the severity of symptoms, vary widely. TSC affects about Epidiolex’s effectiveness for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where 148 patients out of a total of 224 in the study received Epidiolex. The study measured the change from baseline in seizure frequency. In the study, patients treated with Epidiolex had a significantly greater reduction in the frequency of seizures during the treatment period than patients who received placebo (inactive treatment). This effect was seen within eight weeks and remained consistent throughout the 16-week treatment period. The most common side effects that occurred in Epidiolex-treated patients with TSC in the clinical trial were: diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, decreased appetite, sleepiness, fever, and vomiting. Additional side effects for patients with LGS, DS, or TSC include: liver injury, decreased weight, anemia, and increased creatinine. Epidiolex must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. As is true for all drugs that currently treat epilepsy, including Epidiolex, the most serious risks may include an increase in suicidal thoughts and behavior, or thoughts of self-harm. Patients, their caregivers, and their families should be advised to monitor for any unusual changes in mood or behavior, such as worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior. Patients, caregivers, and families should report behaviors of concern immediately to healthcare providers. Epidiolex also caused liver injury in some patients. Most cases were generally mild, but a risk of rare, but more severe liver injury exists. More severe liver injury can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, and/or dark urine. The FDA granted designation for this application. The approval of Epidiolex was granted to Greenwich Biosciences Inc., of Carlsbad, California."},

Both tests from Siemens, the ADVIA Centaur COV2G and Atellica IM COV2G, are what are known as “semi-quantitative” tests, meaning that they do not display a precise measurement, but estimate the quantity of a patient’s antibodies produced against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Due to these unknowns, the FDA cautions patients against using the results from these tests, or any serology test, as an indication that they can stop taking steps to protect themselves and others, such as stopping social distancing, discontinuing wearing masks or returning to work. The FDA also wants to remind patients that serology tests should not be used to diagnose an active infection, as they only detect antibodies the immune system develops in response to the virus – not the virus itself."},

The FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone, after the company provided scientific data showing the test’s ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population. Additionally, the reissuance includes authorization for LabCorp to test pooled samples containing up to five individual swab specimens collected under observation. Sample pooling allows for fewer tests to be run overall, conserving resources and potentially allowing more samples to be evaluated quicker. The FDA recognizes that organizations may want to conduct screening of asymptomatic people as part of a broader strategy to help ensure the safety of their employees, patients, students and others. Last month, the FDA posted updated templates with recommendations for test developers to demonstrate validation for a test to be authorized for screening of asymptomatic people, as well as for sample pooling. Last week, the FDA the first COVID-19 test that could be used with pooled samples. The LabCorp test remains prescription-only and is authorized for human specimen collection either at home using the Pixel by LabCorp or other home sample collection kits authorized for use with LabCorp’s test, or by a health care provider. However, only health care provider-collected samples may be pooled at this time. Additionally, the data reviewed by the FDA demonstrated that the test is as accurate in the broader asymptomatic population as it is among people suspected to have COVID-19. The LabCorp test was originally issued an for use only in people suspected of being ill with COVID-19 by their health care provider and for testing of individual specimens without sample pooling. Until now, molecular diagnostic tests have generally been authorized for people suspected of having COVID-19 by their health care provider, which has allowed asymptomatic people to be tested, when warranted, at the discretion of the health care provider. Today’s authorization eliminates the need for a provider to consider risk factors such as exposure or community spread when prescribing this test.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Cell-Based Gene Therapy For Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory MCL", "date": "July 24, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel), a cell-based gene therapy for treatment of adult patients diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have not responded to or who have relapsed following other kinds of treatment. Tecartus, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, is the first cell-based gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of MCL. MCL is a rare form of cancerous B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. In patients with MCL, B-cells, a type of white blood cell which help the body fight infection, change into cancer cells that start to form tumors in the lymph nodes and quickly spread to other areas of the body. Each dose of Tecartus is a customized treatment created using a patient’s own immune system to help fight the lymphoma. The patient’s T cells, a type of white blood cell, are collected and genetically modified to include a new gene that facilitates the targeting and killing of the lymphoma cells. These modified T cells are then infused back into the patient. The safety and efficacy of Tecartus was established in a multicenter clinical trial of 60 adults with refractory or relapsed MCL who were followed for at least six months after their first objective disease response. The complete remission rate after treatment with Tecartus was 62 percent, with an objective response rate of 87 percent. The label carries a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a systemic response to the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells causing high fever and flu-like symptoms, and for neurologic toxicities. Both CRS and neurologic toxicities can be fatal or life-threatening. The most common side effects of Tecartus include serious infections, low blood cell counts and a weakened immune system. Side effects from treatment usually appear within the first one to two weeks after treatment, but some side effects may occur later. Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Tecartus is being approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which includes elements to assure safe use (ETASU). The risk mitigation measures for Tecartus are identical to those of the current REMS Program for another CAR-T therapy, To further evaluate the long-term safety of Tecartus, the FDA is also requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-marketing observational study involving patients treated with Tecartus. Tecartus was approved under the pathway and was granted designations. Tecartus also received , which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The Tecartus application was reviewed using a cross-agency approach. The clinical review was coordinated by the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, while CBER conducted all other aspects of review and made the final product approval determination.

Naloxone is a medicine that can be administered by individuals with or without medical training to help reduce opioid overdose deaths. If naloxone is administered quickly, it can counter the overdose effects, usually within minutes. The required labeling changes announced in a recommend that health care professionals consider prescribing naloxone when they prescribe medicines to treat OUD. Additionally, the labeling changes recommend that health care professionals consider prescribing naloxone to patients being prescribed opioid pain medicines who are at increased risk of opioid overdose, including those who are also taking benzodiazepines or other medicines that depress the central nervous system; those who have a history of OUD; and those who have experienced a prior opioid overdose. A naloxone prescription should also be considered for patients prescribed opioids who have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The FDA is requiring that these recommendations be added to the prescribing information for opioid pain medicines and medicines to treat OUD, including buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone.

(doing business as Puff Bar), to remove their flavored disposable e-cigarettes and youth-appealing e-liquid products from the market because they do not have the required premarket authorization. These new actions are part of the FDA’s ongoing, aggressive effort to act against illegally marketed tobacco products amid the public health crisis of youth e-cigarette use in America. The agency is particularly concerned about the appeal of flavored, disposable e-cigarettes to youth and continues to monitor all available data. “The FDA continues to prioritize enforcement against e-cigarette products, specifically those most appealing and accessible to youth,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn. “We are concerned about the popularity of these products among youth and want to make clear to all tobacco product manufacturers and retailers that, even during the ongoing pandemic, the FDA is keeping a close watch on the marketplace and will hold companies accountable.” “Despite suspending in-person inspection activities—such as retail compliance checks and vape shop inspections—due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our enforcement against unauthorized e-cigarette products has endured,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “These warning letters are the result of ongoing internet monitoring for violations of tobacco laws and regulations.” Three firms are receiving warning letters for illegally marketing disposable e-cigarettes— . The FDA’s review of the companies’ websites revealed that each firm is selling or distributing unauthorized tobacco products that were first introduced or modified after Aug. 8, 2016—the effective date of the deeming rule that extended the FDA’s authority to all tobacco products. Any new tobacco product not in compliance with the premarket requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) is adulterated and misbranded and may not be marketed without FDA authorization. Puff Bar and HQD Tech USA LLC were also cited for an additional violation for marketing their products as modified risk tobacco products without an FDA order in effect that permits such marketing. Additionally, FDA issued seven other warning letters to the following firms: , who sell or distribute unauthorized electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products targeted to youth or likely to promote use by youth. These firms were cited for marketing unauthorized e-liquids that imitate packaging for food products that often are marketed and appeal to youth, such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, Twinkies, Cherry Coke and popcorn, or feature cartoon characters. The FDA has requested responses from each firm within 15 working days detailing how each company intends to address the agency’s concerns, including the dates on which each firm discontinued the sale and/or distribution of these tobacco products, and its plans for maintaining compliance. Failure to correct violations may result in further action such as a civil money penalty complaint, seizure or injunction. In addition, misbranded or adulterated products imported into the U.S. are subject to detention and refusal of admission. The FDA’s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic also include a recent for violations of the FD&C Act, including marketing new tobacco products without authorization, marketing tobacco products with false and misleading advertising and marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products. Additionally, last month the agency requesting information to help the FDA examine whether certain tobacco products were first marketed after the deeming rule’s effective date and therefore not subject to FDA’s policy on deferred enforcement of the premarket requirements for certain deemed products.

The FDA’s November 2017 was developed to help facilitate and support the innovation of regenerative medicine therapies. The agency also to exercise enforcement discretion, until November 2020, for certain regenerative medicine products, with respect to the FDA’s IND and premarket approval requirements; to give manufacturers time to determine what requirements apply as well as engage with the agency. The FDA is revising the guidance to reflect that FDA generally intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to IND and premarket approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps through May 2021. Since the issuance of the comprehensive regenerative medicine policy framework in late 2017, the FDA has worked with product developers to determine if they need marketing authorization application and, if so, how they should submit their application to the FDA. Importantly, the agency’s enforcement discretion policy for IND and premarket approval requirements does not apply to products that have been associated with reported safety concerns or have the potential to cause significant safety concerns to patients. The agency has stepped up its oversight of cellular and related products in recent years and has issued compliance actions, including numerous warning and untitled letters, and pursued litigation for serious violations of the law, including some involving patient harm.

The agency has seen an increase in hand sanitizer products that are labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but that have tested positive for methanol contamination. State officials have also reported recent adverse events from adults and children ingesting hand sanitizer products contaminated with methanol, including blindness, hospitalizations and death. The agency continues to warn the public not to use specific products listed and is communicating with manufacturers and distributors of these dangerous products about recalling them. The FDA also continues to quality-test hand sanitizers, including testing products entering the country through the U.S. border, and maintains a list of FDA-tested and recalled hand sanitizers on the agency’s , which will be continually updated as dangerous products are discovered. https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol “All Americans should practice good hand hygiene, which includes using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Unfortunately, there are some companies taking advantage of the increased usage of hand sanitizer during the coronavirus pandemic and putting lives at risk by selling products with dangerous and unacceptable ingredients. Consumers and health care providers should not use methanol-containing hand sanitizers,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The FDA remains committed to working with manufacturers, compounders, state boards of pharmacy and the public to increase the safe supply of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. This includes staying vigilant and continuing to take action when quality issues with hand sanitizers arise.” In June, the FDA about products manufactured by Eskbiochem, which contained methanol. Since then, voluntary have been conducted by several of Eskbiochem’s distributors and the agency is recommending additional companies recall their hand sanitizer products. The agency urges consumers to be cautious since some of these products may still be found at retail outlets or for purchase online. The FDA recommends consumers immediately stop using these hand sanitizers and dispose of the bottle in a hazardous waste container, if available, or dispose of as recommended by your local waste management and recycling center. Do not flush or pour these products down the drain or mix with other liquids. Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidentally ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects of methanol poisoning. While methanol-containing hand sanitizers are more life-threatening than others, the FDA urges all consumers not to drink any hand sanitizer product. This is particularly important for young children, especially toddlers, who may be attracted by the pleasant smell or brightly colored bottles. During the pandemic, poison control centers have had an increase in calls about accidental ingestion of hand sanitizer, and it is important that adults keep these products out of reach of children and monitor young children’s use. Do not use hand sanitizer on pets or allow pets to swallow hand sanitizer. If you believe your pet has eaten something potentially dangerous, call a veterinarian or a pet poison control center immediately. Consumers are reminded to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not readily available, the recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol.

The FDA has previously issued EUAs to for their tests, which include many other respiratory organisms in addition to the viruses that cause flu and COVID-19. These combination tests work by testing a single sample from a patient for multiple respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and the seasonal flu which can show similar symptoms. There are several important advantages to this combination testing. Taking just one sample from a patient may help alleviate the need for multiple samplings, which means less discomfort for the patient with faster and more comprehensive results. In addition, combination tests require fewer supplies, such as swabs and personal protective equipment, and reduce pressure on the supply chain for reagents. The FDA encourages additional developers to work with the FDA on combination tests that may be useful in preserving critical testing resources in the upcoming flu season during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA has updated the Molecular Diagnostic EUA templates to add information about these types of tests to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of EUAs of combination tests that address the COVID-19 public health emergency.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues First Emergency Authorization for Sample Pooling in Diagnostic Testing", "date": "July 18, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reissued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Quest Diagnostics to authorize its for use with pooled samples containing up to four individual swab specimens collected under observation. The Quest test is the first COVID-19 diagnostic test to be authorized for use with pooled samples. Sample pooling is an important public health tool because it allows for more people to be tested quickly using fewer testing resources. Sample pooling does this by allowing multiple people – in this case four individuals – to be tested at once. The samples collected from these four individuals are then tested in a pool or “batch” using one test, rather than running each individual sample on its own test. If the pool is positive, it means that one or more of the individuals tested in that pool may be infected, so each of the samples in that pool are tested again individually. Because the samples are pooled, it is expected that fewer tests are run overall, meaning fewer testing supplies are used and more tests can be run at the same time allowing patients to receive their results more quickly in most cases. This testing strategy is most efficient in areas with low prevalence, meaning most results are expected to be negative. While there is a concern that combining samples may make it more difficult to detect positives, since pooling in the laboratory dilutes any viral material present in the samples, Quest’s validation data demonstrates that its test correctly identified all of the pooled samples that contained a positive sample. It is important to note that the Quest test, initially authorized on March 17, 2020, remains authorized to test individual samples collected by their health care provider from people with suspected COVID-19 infection. The test is also still authorized for use with individual nasal swab specimens that are self-collected at home or in a health care setting using an authorized home-collection kit when determined to be appropriate by a health care provider.

Despite pausing on-site surveillance inspections in the U.S. in March, our investigators have conducted mission critical inspections and other activities to ensure FDA-regulated industries are meeting applicable FDA requirements. We have had great success by using a number of tools as part of the agency’s risk-based approach to ensuring quality, including remote assessments and import alerts as well as other compliance requirements. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued, we adjusted our processes and guidance as necessary to maintain the appropriate level of review to ensure the safety of consumer products, including hand sanitizer, diagnostic tests and more. At the same time, we have been closely monitoring reopening criteria established at the federal, state or county levels and planning to identify when and where to resume domestic inspections, prioritizing the inspections based on risk and other factors. To arm our investigators with the most reliable and accurate information, the FDA has developed a rating system to assist us in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. The COVID-19 Advisory Rating system (COVID-19 Advisory Level) uses real-time data to qualitatively assess the number of COVID-19 cases in a local area based on state and national data. We are also making the Advisory Level data available to our state partners who carry out inspections of FDA-regulated entities on the agency’s behalf under contract. The Advisory Level is based upon the outcome of three metrics: Phase of the State (as defined by the White House guidelines) and statistics measured at the county level to gauge the current trend and intensity of infection. When each of these is taken into consideration, the FDA will identify regulatory activities that can occur within the given geographic region. The three main categories of regulatory activity at the county level will be: mission critical inspections only, all inspections with caveats to help protect staff who have self-identified as being in a vulnerable population and resumption of all regulatory activities. At this time, we are working toward the goal of restarting on-site inspections during the week of July 20. However, resuming prioritized domestic inspections will depend on the data about the virus’ trajectory in a given state and locality and the rules and guidelines that are put in place by state and local governments. In order to move to the next phase, we must see downward trends in new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations in a given area. Our ability to resume is also affected by other services that have been curtailed by the pandemic, such as public transportation. The availability of these services will be an important factor in how we determine resuming domestic inspections. The FDA has also determined that, for the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses. This will help assure the safety of the investigator and the firm’s employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish our regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities. Due to the nature of retail tobacco inspections, these inspections will not be pre-announced when they resume, as they are undercover operations where the retailer is unaware an inspection is taking place. The health, safety and well-being of our investigators, as well as the public, are of the utmost importance to us. We will ensure our investigators are outfitted with personal protective equipment and are equipped with other necessary equipment to carry out their work while adhering to state and local guidance as well as applicable CDC guidance.

{"title": "FDA Launches New Era of Smarter Food Safety Initiative, Releases Blueprint and Pilot Study", "date": "July 13, 2020", "contents": " Today, it is my great privilege to announce FDA’s . We were originally going to make this announcement in March, but as you all are well aware, we were forced to turn our attention to addressing the public health emergency posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the months that have followed, it has become even clearer — from our experiences with the pandemic and the lessons we have been learning as part of the FDA’s response to it — just how essential the actions outlined in this blueprint are and, if anything, that they are more important now, than ever. Whatever theoretical or aspirational aspects there were to this blueprint before the pandemic, those have been propelled into concrete and essential action plans. I’ll explain what I mean as I get into the details of just how we will be leveraging new technologies and approaches to create a more digital, transparent and safer food system. I want to point out that food safety was high on my radar even before I’d come to the FDA. I’d heard about the New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative and, upon arrived at the Agency, it was one of the first things I wanted to learn more about. That’s in part because it seemed to align closely with the core values that have guided me in my work as a medical and public health professional: to apply the best medical science and most rigorous data to the work; to promote integrity and transparency; and to advance innovation and discovery. So, when I arrived at the FDA last December, there was no doubt that some of the first people I wanted to speak with were the leaders of FDA’s leadership on foods, Frank Yiannas, FDA’s Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response, Susan Mayne, the director of our Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Steve Solomon, the director of our Center for Veterinary Medicine, and Judy McMeekin, the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. These leaders highlighted the enormous opportunities we have to use cutting edge science and technology in support of our ability to help ensure the safety of the American public. And they explained just how the intends to do that, by incorporating input from external stakeholders in industry, our state partners, and multiple levels of experts within FDA’s foods program. The blueprint outlines a path forward that builds on the work the FDA has already done through implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). As you know, FSMA has been a centerpiece of our work to help ensure food safety and prevent foodborne illnesses through the use of science and risk-based standards. The authority granted by FSMA enables a flexible framework that is adaptable to the changing food environment as science and technologies evolve. The blueprint we release today represents the next stage in this process — a commitment we are making to the American people that we will work as fast and effectively as we can, as fast and effectively as we can, to help ensure that we have the safest food system in the world. And we’ll do this in part by incorporating the use of the most modern technologies that are already in use in society and the business sector. Some of this innovation is already creating a revolution in food production, supply, and delivery. These developments offer great opportunity, but also pose many challenges, some of which are complicated by an increasingly complex global supply chain. I want to note that while the New Era has a strong emphasis in the application of new technology, it’s not about technology. It’s about using that technology to build and put in place more effective approaches and processes. I’d like to spend a few minutes going over the of the blueprint. The first is tech-enabled traceability. This is one of those areas that we’ve learned during the pandemic has utility beyond our response to outbreaks of foodborne illness. One of the challenges we’ve faced over the years is recurring outbreaks of illnesses associated with the consumption of certain foods. What this daunting problem underscores is the critical importance of the FDA working with industry so that we can rapidly trace a contaminated food to its source. And when I say rapidly, I mean minutes, not days, weeks, or even longer. We want to explore ways to encourage companies to adopt tracing technologies and also to harmonize efforts to follow food from farm to table. We should strive to speak the same language, by espousing similar data standards across government and industry for tracking and tracing a food product. During the pandemic we realized that widespread traceability provides greater supply chain visibility. This, in turn, can help the FDA and the food industry anticipate the kind of imbalances in the marketplace that led to temporary shortages of certain commodities and created food waste when producers lost customers because restaurants, schools, and other sites temporarily closed. In addition, enhanced traceability, coupled with advanced analytical tools, could help us spot potential problems in advance and help us prevent or lessen their impact. A second core element of the blueprint involves our ability to draw on the power of new data streams. One of our most important resources we have today lies in our ability to unleash the power of data. We intend to do everything we can to attain better quality data, conduct a more meaningful analysis of it, and to transform streams of data into more meaningful, strategic, and prevention-oriented actions. The plans embraced by the blueprint include strengthening our procedures and protocols for conducting the root cause analyses that can identify how a food became contaminated and inform our understanding of how to help prevent that from happening again. The need for greater traceability and predictive analytics can be seen in our most recent efforts to improve the safety of romaine lettuce and other leafy greens, which have too often been implicated in outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing (STEC) infections. The repeat nature of these outbreaks illustrates the importance of achieving end-to-end traceability and of maximizing the effectiveness of root cause analyses. Another example of the kinds of new tools we’re developing for prevention can be seen in a pilot program we’re conducting that will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to strengthen the agency’s review of imported foods at ports of entry to help ensure that they meet U.S. food safety standards. A proof of concept application of AI and machine learning models to historical shipment data indicates that we can expect very promising results from this pilot. Imagine having a tool that expedites the clearance of legitimate, compliant shipments and improves by 300 percent our ability to know which shipping container to examine because that container is more likely to have violative products. It would save an immense amount of time, and potentially lives. We’re also taking a look at new business models for the production and delivery of food. In recent years, groceries and meals have increasingly been ordered online and delivered directly to our homes. In the past few months, however, as consumers have heeded stay-at-home recommendations and ordered their food online from restaurants and supermarkets, this trend has skyrocketed. We must help ensure that as these foods travel to our front doors, they continue to be safe for consumers. That concept is important an any time, but COVID-19 has accelerated the need to establish best practices and an industry standard of care in this area. New business models include novel ways of producing foods and ingredients, such as cell-cultured food products, and we plan to take a close look at these. We intend to ensure that as food technology evolves, our oversight evolves along with it, to help ensure food safety. As we look at these business models of the future, we will also be working to help modernize food safety at restaurants and other retail food outlets, which are one of the more frequently cited locations associated with outbreaks of foodborne illness. FDA research shows the importance of supporting practices in retail establishments known to reduce the risk of food contamination, such as proper handwashing and storing foods at the right temperature. We’re committed to exploring new approaches of food safety that go beyond traditional training and inspection. Many restaurants and other retail outlets have had to temporarily close or change the way they do business during the pandemic. As they start back up and get their bearings, we intend to engage with the retail food industry and our partners in state government to help change practices, including a greater focus on how we motivate behavior changes by retail workers. We’ll also encourage and explore the use of new digital tools that will support food safety practices. Finally, the blueprint involves a focus on fostering the growth of and strengthening the food safety culture on farms and in food facilities all over the world. The importance of having a safety culture is something very familiar to me as the administrator of a medical center, as this is a central tenet in efforts to protect hospital patients. The pandemic has given us a new perspective on what we mean by food safety culture. We still believe that to make dramatic reductions foodborne disease we must do more to influence and change human behavior, as well as to address how employees think about food safety, and how they demonstrate their commitment to this as part of their jobs. But a strong culture of food safety involves more than this. It’s also about keeping those food workers safe and about educating consumers, who are cooking more at home these days, on safe food handling practices. We’re not just encouraging the food industry to make changes; we’re looking within our ranks to see how we can approach these issues differently to better support and advance each of these priority areas. When I asked Deputy Commissioner Yiannas early on in my tenure about how this blueprint first began to come together, I was impressed to learn that literally hundreds of people were directly involved in its creation. Not only did the FDA’s leadership work closely on this; their staffs participated in a series of brainstorming sessions on how to make the New Era a reality. They also held a public meeting in which more than 1,500 stakeholders participated or submitted comments via the Federal Register. This broad input, representing the expertise of food safety experts, the food industry, tech companies, and public health officials from all over the world, led to the development of short- and long-term strategies that we will continue to explore and seek to execute over the next decade. As I hope you can grasp, I am very excited about the New Era of Smarter Food Safety, the potential it offers, and I look forward to helping advance it to the next stages. I know that my colleagues at the FDA will be working as quickly and efficiently as possible, and I call on the food industry to do the same. As this work goes forward, we want to hear from you, to ensure that this process remains transparent and collaborative. That is why we plan to keep you posted on our plans and progress. And, right now, I want to give you two ways you can easily do this. Please visit, and click on the link for e-mail updates. This will ensure that you don’t miss any developments as we move forward. Even more important, I encourage you to go and read the entire blueprint. And please read it with the understanding that it is a work in progress that requires your input. As I mentioned at the outset, we know from our experience during the pandemic that the blueprint involves ideas whose time has come. Implementing them will strengthen our ability to protect the food supply in good times and bad. And it will allow us to change as our world changes and the challenges and opportunities of food technology evolve. But with all this change, I want to assure you that there’s one thing that will remain consistent and unchanged, and that’s our steadfast commitment to protect the American public. We look forward to working with all of you to achieve that important goal.

The virus uses one part of the spike protein to attach to a cell and another to fuse with the cell membrane, enabling the virus to infect the cell. The scientists , which could help inform vaccine design by increasing our understanding of the various triggered antibody responses. As of mid-June, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than eight million cases of infection and approximately 450,000 deaths globally, making the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent this disease a priority. The spike glycoprotein is the key target for protective antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and the related SARS-CoV-1 virus. Therefore, many vaccine candidates that trigger antibodies — against specific areas on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein — are being investigated.

In addition, the guidance includes a new question-and-answer regarding how to obtain informed consent from a prospective trial participant in certain circumstances where the enrollment timeframe is limited and the patient can receive a copy of an informed consent document electronically but cannot sign it electronically or print it out for signature. The guidance also clarifies recommendations on documenting details when using video conferencing for trial visits. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for in individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The FDA has previously issued EUAs to for their tests, which include many other respiratory organisms in addition to the viruses that cause flu and COVID-19. These combination tests work by testing a single sample from a patient for multiple respiratory diseases. Tests based on taking just one sample from a patient may help alleviate the need for multiple sample collections, which means less discomfort for the patient with faster and more comprehensive results. The FDA encourages additional developers to work with the FDA on combination tests that may be useful in preserving critical testing resources during the upcoming flu season. On July 2, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the second Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a COVID-19 antigen test. An antigen test is a diagnostic test that quickly detects fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the patient’s nasal cavity using swabs. The EUA was issued to Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) for the BD Veritor System For Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests can provide results in minutes, be produced at a lower cost than molecular tests, and potentially scale to test millions of Americans per day once multiple manufacturers enter the market. However, antigen tests may not detect all active infections, as they do not work the same way as a PCR test. The FDA will continue to support the development, review, and monitoring of tests to help ensure accuracy while balancing the urgent need for these critical diagnostics. Testing updates: To date, the FDA has currently authorized 164 tests under EUAs; these include 137 molecular tests, 25 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests."},

Dravet syndrome is a life-threatening, rare and chronic form of epilepsy. It is often characterized by severe and unrelenting seizures despite medical treatment. The effectiveness of Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome was demonstrated in two clinical studies in 202 subjects between ages 2 and 18. The studies measured the change from baseline in the frequency of convulsive seizures. In both studies, subjects treated with Fintepla had significantly greater reductions in the frequency of convulsive seizures during the trials than subjects who received placebo (inactive treatment). These reductions were seen within 3-4 weeks, and remained generally consistent over the 14- to 15-week treatment periods. Fintepla labeling includes a boxed warning stating the drug is associated with valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Because of these risks, patients must have cardiac monitoring using echocardiograms performed before treatment, every six months during treatment, and once three to six months after treatment is discontinued. If the echocardiogram shows signs of VHD, PAH, or other cardiac abnormalities, health care professionals must consider the benefits and risks of continuing treatment with Fintepla for the patient. Because of the risks of VHD and PAH, Fintepla is available only through a restricted drug distribution program, under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The Fintepla REMS requires health care professionals who prescribe Fintepla and pharmacies that dispense Fintepla to be specially certified in the Fintepla REMS and that patients be enrolled in the REMS. As part of the REMS requirements, prescribers and patients must adhere to the required cardiac monitoring with echocardiograms to receive Fintepla. The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies were decreased appetite; drowsiness, sedation and lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue or lack of energy; ataxia (lack of coordination), balance disorder, gait disturbance (trouble with walking); increased blood pressure; drooling, salivary hypersecretion (saliva overproduction); pyrexia (fever); upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; risk of falls; and status epilepticus.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of IQOS Tobacco Heating System with ‘Reduced Exposure’ Information", "date": "July 07, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of Philip Morris Products S.A.’s “ This marks the second set of products ever to be authorized as MRTPs and the first tobacco products to receive “exposure modification” orders, which permits the marketing of a product as containing a reduced level of or presenting a reduced exposure to a substance or as being free of a substance when the issuance of the order is expected to benefit the health of the population. Importantly, the authorization for these products requires the company to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies to determine whether the MRTP orders continues to be appropriate, including assessing the potential for increased use among youth. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System includes the electronic IQOS device that generates a nicotine-containing aerosol by heating tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, specifically Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks. The FDA previously of these products without modified risk information in April 2019 via the premarket tobacco application (PMTA) pathway. Today’s action pertains to the separate MRTP applications for these products and further authorizes the manufacturer to market these specific products with the following information: “AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO DATE: Even with this action, these products are not safe nor “FDA approved.” The exposure modification orders also do not permit the company to make any other modified risk claims or any express or implied statements that convey or could mislead consumers into believing that the products are endorsed or approved by the FDA, or that the FDA deems the products to be safe for use by consumers. There are two types of MRTP orders the FDA may issue: a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order. The company had requested both types of orders for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System. After reviewing the available scientific evidence, public comments and recommendations from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, the FDA determined that the evidence did not support issuing risk modification orders at this time but that it did support issuing exposure modification orders for these products. This determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modifications orders is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. In particular, the agency determined the company demonstrated that because the IQOS Tobacco Heating System heats tobacco and does not burn it, it significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals compared to cigarette smoke. Furthermore, studies showed switching completely from combusted cigarettes to the IQOS Tobacco Heating System significantly reduces the body’s exposure to 15 specific harmful and potentially harmful chemicals. The toxicological assessment also found that, compared with cigarette smoke, IQOS aerosols contain considerably lower levels of potential carcinogens and toxic chemicals that can harm the respiratory or reproductive systems. Additionally, the FDA found that the applications supported the required consumer understanding findings. Today’s authorization requires Philip Morris Products S.A. to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies to determine the impact of these orders on consumer perception, behavior and health, and to enable the FDA to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the orders were based. These postmarket requirements include a rigorous toxicity study using computer models to help predict potential adverse effects in users. The orders also require the company to monitor youth awareness and use of the products to help ensure that the marketing of the MRTPs does not have unintended consequences for youth use. The company must also keep the FDA apprised of efforts to prevent youth access and exposure. These requirements are in addition to the postmarket requirements and restrictions previously placed on these products in their April 2019 PMTA authorizations, such as reporting information to the FDA about consumer research studies, sales and advertising information and adverse experiences, among others. In particular, to limit youth access to the products and to limit youth exposure to IQOS advertising and promotion, the PMTA authorization placed stringent restrictions on how the products are marketed – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including requirements that advertising be targeted to adults of legal age to purchase tobacco products. The company must request and receive authorization from the FDA to continue marketing the products with the same modified exposure information after the initial orders expire in 4 years. The FDA also may withdraw the initial and any potential subsequent exposure modification orders if the agency determines that, among other things, the orders are no longer expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole, for example as a result of an uptake in use of the products by youth or former smokers, or a decrease in the number of current smokers who completely switch to the products. outlined in the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act allows companies to submit applications for the FDA to evaluate whether a tobacco product may be sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease. By law, the FDA must also ensure that the advertising and labeling of modified risk products enables the public to understand the modified risk or modified exposure information and to understand the significance that information has in the context of total health and in relation to all tobacco-related diseases and health conditions. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. The IQOS system heats tobacco but does not burn it. This significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals. Scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the IQOS system significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.”"},

Patients should be selected based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test. HER2-positive breast cancer, which makes up approximately one-fifth of breast cancers, has too much of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to sites on HER2 and disrupt signaling to stop cancer cell growth. Phesgo is initially used in combination with chemotherapy and could continue to be administered at home by a qualified health care professional once the chemotherapy regimen is finished. Phesgo contains a fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab with hyaluronidase for injection under the skin. The therapeutic components in Phesgo are the same as those in FDA-approved intravenous (IV) pertuzumab and IV trastuzumab. The FDA’s approval was based on the results of a non-inferiority study in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, which demonstrated Phesgo had comparable efficacy and safety as IV pertuzumab and IV trastuzumab, except for administration-related reactions, which were higher with Phesgo due to the subcutaneous route of administration. Prescribing information for Phesgo includes a boxed warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of potential heart failure, fetal harm and lung toxicity. Health care professionals should use similar monitoring parameters as those used with IV pertuzumab and IV trastuzumab. The most common side effects for patients taking Phesgo were alopecia (hair loss), nausea, diarrhea, anemia (reduced number of red blood cells) and asthenia (lack of energy). Phesgo can cause worsening of chemotherapy induced neutropenia (low level of white blood cells). Women who are pregnant should be advised that Phesgo may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. The FDA advises health care professionals to inform females of reproductive age that exposure to Phesgo during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Patients who experience anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) or severe hypersensitivity should discontinue Phesgo. The FDA granted approval of Phesgo to Genentech Inc.

This marks the first immunotherapy approved for this patient population as a first-line treatment and which is administered to patients without also giving chemotherapy. MSI-H and dMMR tumors contain abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell. The frequency of MSI-H varies across tumor types and stages, and approximately 5% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Keytruda works by targeting the cellular pathway of proteins found on the body’s immune cells and some cancer cells, known as PD-1/PD-L1. By blocking this pathway, Keytruda may help the body’s immune system fight the cancer cells and provide a benefit in patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer. The FDA previously approved Keytruda to treat other types of cancer. The FDA’s approval for this indication was based on the results of one multicenter, international, open-label, active-controlled, randomized trial that compared Keytruda with chemotherapy treatment in 307 patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent review. Median PFS was 16.5 months in the Keytruda group and 8.2 months in the standard of care group. Longer-term analysis is needed to assess for an effect on survival. Common side effects of Keytruda include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, itchy skin (pruritus), diarrhea, nausea, rash, fever (pyrexia), cough, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), constipation, pain, and abdominal pain. Keytruda can cause serious conditions known as immune-mediated side effects, including inflammation of healthy organs such as the lungs (pneumonitis), colon (colitis), liver (hepatitis), endocrine glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis).

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Takes Action to Help Facilitate Timely Development of Safe, Effective COVID-19 Vaccines", "date": "June 30, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took important action to help facilitate the timely development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 by providing with recommendations for those developing COVID-19 vaccines for the ultimate purpose of licensure. The guidance, which reflects advice the FDA has been providing over the past several months to companies, researchers, and others, describes the agency’s current recommendations regarding the data needed to facilitate the manufacturing, clinical development, and approval of a COVID-19 vaccine. “We recognize the urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and continue to work collaboratively with industry, researchers, as well as federal, domestic, and international partners to accelerate these efforts. While the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in our decisions and are making clear through this guidance what data should be submitted to meet our regulatory standards. This is particularly important, as we know that some people are skeptical of vaccine development efforts,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “We have not lost sight of our responsibility to the American people to maintain our regulatory independence and ensure our decisions related to all medical products, including COVID-19 vaccines, are based on science and the available data. This is a commitment that the American public can have confidence in and one that I will continue to uphold.” Vaccines have been highly effective in preventing a range of serious infectious diseases. The FDA has the scientific expertise to evaluate any potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate regardless of the technology used to produce or to administer the vaccine. This includes the different technologies such as DNA, RNA, protein and viral vectored vaccines being developed by commercial vaccine manufacturers and other entities. “In this particular crisis in which there is so much at stake, we need to help expedite vaccine development as much as we can without sacrificing our standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. We firmly believe that transparency regarding the FDA’s current thinking about the scientific data needed to support approval of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines will help build public confidence in the FDA’s evaluation process, which will be critical in ensuring their use,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Right now, neither the FDA nor the scientific community can predict how quickly data will be generated from vaccine clinical trials. Once data are generated, the agency is committed to thoroughly and expeditiously evaluating it all. But make no mistake: the FDA will only approve or make available a COVID-19 vaccine if we determine that it meets the high standards that people have come to expect of the agency.” The guidance published today, “ ,” provides an overview of key considerations to satisfy requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and control, nonclinical and clinical data through development and licensure, and for post-licensure safety evaluation. Importantly, given the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology, the goal of development programs at this time should be to support traditional FDA approval by conducting studies to directly evaluate the ability of the vaccine to protect humans from SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or disease. The FDA strongly encourages the inclusion of diverse populations in all phases of clinical development, including populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities, as well as adequate representation in late phase trials of elderly individuals and those with medical comorbidities. Sponsors are also encouraged to include studies in their development plans that would provide data to support use during pregnancy, as well as plan for pediatric assessments of safety and effectiveness. The guidance also discusses the importance of ensuring that the sizes of clinical trials are large enough to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. It conveys that the FDA would expect that a COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated. Additionally, after approval by the FDA, the safety of all vaccines, including a COVID-19 vaccine, continues to be closely monitored using various existing surveillance systems. The FDA may also require post-marketing studies to further assess known or potential serious risks. The guidance also notes that, as more is learned about SARS-CoV-2 immunology and vaccine immune responses, consideration may be given to the FDA’s pathway for vaccine licensure. However, identification of an immune response or other measure that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit would be needed for a specific vaccine candidate to use of this pathway. Due to the current public health emergency, the guidance also addresses considerations regarding Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of an investigational vaccine – making clear that an assessment regarding any potential EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine would be made on a case-by-case basis considering the target population, the characteristics of the product, and the totality of the relevant, available scientific evidence, including preclinical and human clinical study data on the product’s safety and effectiveness.

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) further supported its effort to evaluate diagnostic tests for COVID-19 by distributing the first round of SARS-CoV-2 reference panel materials. The panel is an independent performance validation step — for diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection — being used for clinical, not research, purposes. The reference panel can help characterize a test's level of detection and establish relative sensitivity among tests. The FDA panel is available to commercial and laboratory developers who are interacting with the FDA through the pre-emergency use authorization (EUA) process or whose tests have been issued an EUA. The FDA will provide the reference panel to developers at the appropriate stage in the process.

The agency has also taken additional action to help prevent certain hand sanitizers from entering the United States by placing them on an . The FDA is proactively working with manufacturers to recall products and is encouraging retailers to remove products from store shelves and online marketplaces. As part of these actions, a has been issued to Eskbiochem S.A. de C.V. regarding the distribution of products labeled as manufactured at its facilities with undeclared methanol, misleading claims –including incorrectly stating that FDA approved these products—and improper manufacturing practices. The FDA first about some of the methanol-containing hand sanitizers being sold in retail stores and online in June. The agency earlier this month about an increasing number of adverse events, including blindness, cardiac effects, effects on the central nervous system, and hospitalizations and death, primarily reported to poison control centers and state departments of health. The agency continues to see these figures rise. “Practicing good hand hygiene, which includes using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available, is an important public health tool for all Americans to employ. Consumers must also be vigilant about which hand sanitizers they use, and for their health and safety we urge consumers to immediately stop using all hand sanitizers on the FDA’s of dangerous hand sanitizer products,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “We remain extremely concerned about the potential serious risks of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing methanol. Producing, importing and distributing toxic hand sanitizers poses a serious threat to the public and will not be tolerated. The FDA will take additional action as necessary and will continue to provide the latest information on this issue for the health and safety of consumers.” The agency has posted a of dangerous hand sanitizer products, which is being updated regularly. In most cases, methanol does not appear on the product label. However, methanol is not an acceptable ingredient in any drug, including hand sanitizer, even if methanol is listed as an ingredient on the product label. The FDA’s ongoing testing has found methanol contamination in hand sanitizer products ranging from 1% to 80%. Importantly, the FDA is urging consumers not to use any hand sanitizer products from the particular manufacturers on the list even if the product or particular lot number are not listed since some manufacturers are recalling only certain – but not all – of their hand sanitizer products. Manufacturers’ failure to immediately recall all potentially affected products is placing consumers in danger of methanol poisoning. One of the reported deaths is associated with Blumen Hand Sanitizer, distributed by 4e North America and manufactured by 4E Global in Mexico, who recently expanded its recall to include additional lots of its hand sanitizer products. Additionally, the FDA is strongly urging distributors and retailers to stop distributing and selling hand sanitizers manufactured by the firms on the list immediately, even if the particular product is not included in a recall, due to the risk of methanol poisoning. When identifying hand sanitizers from the FDA’s do-not-use list, consumers should look for one or more identifiers from the list that match the product’s labeling, including: If any of the identifiers (name, company, or NDC) match a product on the list, the FDA urges consumers to immediately stop using the hand sanitizer. Dispose of the hand sanitizer bottle in a hazardous waste container, if available, or dispose of as recommended by local waste management and recycling centers. Do not flush or pour these products down the drain or mix with other liquids. Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment for potential reversal of the toxic effects of methanol poisoning. The FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA’s program (please provide the agency with as much information to identify the product as possible): Consumers, manufacturers or distributors who have questions for the FDA regarding hand sanitizers should email The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Recarbrio was previously FDA-approved to treat patients with complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections who have limited or no alternative treatment options. HABP and VABP are a type of pneumonia that occurs in hospitalized patients and can cause symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, chest pain and increased oxygen requirements. Recarbrio is a combination of imipenem-cilastatin and relebactam. The drug is administered intravenously by a health care professional. The safety and efficacy of Recarbrio for the treatment of HABP/VABP were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 535 hospitalized adults with HABP/VABP due gram-negative bacteria (a type of bacteria) in which 266 patients were treated with Recarbrio and 269 patients were treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, another antibacterial drug. Overall, 16% of patients who received Recarbrio and 21% of patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam died through Day 28 of the study. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Recarbrio for HABP/VABP included increased aspartate/alanine aminotransferases (increased liver enzymes), anemia, diarrhea, hypokalemia (low potassium) and hyponatremia (low sodium).

Generally, antibody tests, also called serological tests, detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, which can help identify individuals who have developed an adaptive immune response to the virus, as part of either an active infection or a prior infection. These tests may be important in the fight against this pandemic, as they may provide information on disease prevalence and the frequency of asymptomatic infection. Today’s warning letters are the first set of letters the agency has issued for marketing adulterated or misbranded COVID-19 test kits. Warning letters were issued to: of Sheung Wan, Hong Kong; of Chicago, Illinois. Violations outlined in the warning letters include: offering test kits for sale in the United States directly to consumers for at-home use without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from the FDA; misbranding products with labeling that falsely claims products are “FDA approved”; and labeling that bears the FDA logo, which is only for the official use by the FDA and not for use on private sector materials. The FDA reminds the public that, at the present time, there are no diagnostic or antibody COVID-19 test kits that are authorized, cleared or approved to be used completely at home. Testing in the home can present unique and potentially serious public health risks, including whether a lay user has the ability to collect their specimen, run the test, and interpret their results accurately. However, the FDA has authorized several diagnostic COVID-19 tests for use with at-home collection of samples – such as from the nose or saliva – that can then be sent to a lab for processing and test reporting. However, there are not any serology tests that are authorized for use with at-home collection of samples. The FDA has requested that the companies take immediate steps to correct violations, such as ceasing the sale of the products or preventing future sales. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in the warning letters may result in legal action, including possible seizure and injunction. The FDA reminds consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products, including test kits, that claim to prevent, mitigate, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19.

The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. On June 16, 2020, the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug application for USP 200 mg/10 mL, which is indicated, in addition to general anesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation and to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Side effects of succinylcholine chloride injection include anaphylaxis, hyperkalemia, and malignant hyperthermia. The FDA recognizes the increased demand for certain products during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and we remain committed to facilitating access to safe and effective medical products to help address critical needs of the American public. Today, the FDA published the . Clinical trials and development across investigational product areas have been impacted by public health measures to control the COVID-19 virus; this guidance shares recommendations on statistical considerations to address the impact of COVID-19 on meeting objectives of clinical trials conducted during this public health emergency. This guidance applies to clinical trials of human medical products and animal drugs. Today, as part of its commitment to protect consumers and patients from fraudulent COVID-19 products and from the potential serious public health risks of these products, the FDA issued warning letters to three companies: . The warning letters were issued for marketing COVID-19 tests adulterated and misbranded COVID-19 antibody tests. Violations outlined in the letters include: offering test kits for sale in the United States directly to consumers for at-home use without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from the FDA; misbranding products with labeling that falsely claims product are “FDA approved”; and labeling that bears the FDA logo, which is only for the official use by the FDA and not for use on private-sector materials. The FDA reminds the public that, at the present time, there are no diagnostic or antibody COVID-19 test kits that are currently authorized, cleared, or approved to be used completely at home. The FDA has authorized several diagnostic COVID-19 tests for use with at-home collection of samples (e.g., nasal, salivary) that can then be sent to a lab for processing and test reporting. However, there are not any antibody tests that are authorized for use with at-home collection of samples. Testing updates: To date, the FDA has currently authorized 139 tests under EUAs; these include 118 molecular tests, 20 antibody tests, and 1 antigen test."},
{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Takes Additional Action to Harness Real-World Data to Inform COVID-19 Response Efforts ", "date": "June 18, 2020", "contents": " Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has taken an additional step in harnessing real-world data to help inform the agency’s overall response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA is announcing its participation in the COVID-19 Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator, a multi-stakeholder collaborative project to advance the development of diagnostics. The Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator is organized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research. “While there are current studies of viral diagnostic and antibody tests using traditional assessment methods, the Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator will allow the community to analyze both diagnostic and clinical data in real time, which has the potential to contribute to the scientific evaluation of diagnostic tools and medical interventions for COVID-19,” said Amy Abernethy, M.D., PhD., FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner. “FDA’s participation in the Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator is another example of how we are working with a broad set of experts in healthcare data and analytics to understand the performance of SARS-CoV-2 tests and to inform clinical and public health decision-making.” The Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator is the companion project to the previously announced , which brings together leading experts in health data aggregation and analytics in a unified, collaborative effort to share insights, compare results and answer key questions to inform the collective COVID-19 response. “This collaboration with the FDA, scientists and data experts is meeting the urgency of the moment to speed the pace of diagnostic testing,” said Ellen V. Sigal, Chair of both the Reagan-Udall Foundation and Friends of Cancer Research. “We all share the goal of deepening our understanding of COVID-19 on every front to ensure that patients receive the best care as quickly and safely as possible.” Key research questions that will be examined through the Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator include evaluating the real-world performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and antibody tests, how they are best used to tailor testing strategies to specific populations, and what test results and data may reveal about the prevalence of disease, chains of transmission, and individual and population-level immunity. This effort will focus on the use of real-world data to understand whether the presence of antibodies can indicate future immunity and if so, which specific antibodies and epitopes contribute to some level of protection against future infection. Using real-world data can also provide actionable information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in specific populations and highlight individual risk factors for patients, helping to improve our understanding of the disease, tailor public health interventions and strategies to mitigate risks for individuals and communities, and help stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The evidence generated through the Diagnostics Accelerator is intended to be complementary to other studies that have been conducted or are underway as well as to address questions not yet answered. “We recognize that questions related to the accuracy of diagnostic tests require different data elements that are not as widely available as those in the therapeutic space. They also require a different approach to data integration and analysis,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., Director of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The aim of the Accelerator is to propose questions, refine them, evaluate the feasibility of different approaches, and bring together groups that have the data to answer the questions and develop lasting solutions. Ultimately, we hope that real-world data can provide a more generalizable and rapid read-out of results than traditional clinical trials.” The Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator represents the type of data-focused effort that has the potential to inform our future emergency efforts. In an emergency setting, the FDA may issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs) which are evaluated using a different standard than is required for approval or clearance in non-emergency situations. Gaining a better understanding of the real-world performance characteristics of diagnostic tests and antibody tests can help inform future EUAs. The FDA continues to engage with stakeholders and collaborate with partners on opportunities to apply data from diverse sources to inform its response to COVID-19. To engage with the FDA on these efforts, The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Therapy for Rare Disease that Causes Low Phosphate Blood Levels, Bone Softening", "date": "June 18, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Crysvita (burosumab-twza) injection to treat patients age two and older with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a rare disease that is characterized by the development of tumors that cause weakened and softened bones. The tumors associated with TIO release a peptide hormone-like substance known as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lowers phosphate levels. FGF23 regulates levels of phosphate, an electrolyte that plays important roles in bone maintenance, energy production by cells and nerve function. When there is not enough phosphate in the body, bones begin to soften and weaken, causing osteomalacia (marked softening of bones). The safety and efficacy of Crysvita were evaluated in two studies that together enrolled 27 adults with TIO. In both studies, patients received Crysvita every four weeks. For the first study, half of patients achieved normal phosphate levels through week 24 and maintained normal or near normal phosphate levels through week 144. In the second study, 69% of participants achieved normal phosphate levels through week 24 and maintained normal or near normal phosphate levels through week 88. The results of bone scans for patients in the first study also suggested healing of the bone lesions related to osteomalacia (softening of the bones). Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash and hives have been reported in patients who took Crysvita. If serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, patients should stop taking Crysvita and talk with their health care provider about further medical treatment. Additionally, higher than normal levels of phosphorus may be associated with an increased risk of nephrocalcinosis (a disorder that occurs when too much calcium is deposited in the kidneys). The most common side effects reported in adults with TIO taking Crysvita were tooth abscess (infection), muscle spasms, dizziness, constipation, injection site reaction, rash and headaches. Patients taking oral phosphate or active vitamin D, those who have serum phosphate levels within or above the normal range for their age, and patients with severe kidney impairment or end stage renal disease should not take Crysvita. Crysvita is also FDA-approved to treat adults and children six months and older with X-linked hypophosphatemia, which causes low levels of phosphate in the blood and leads to impaired bone growth and development in children and teenagers. The FDA granted approval of Crysvita to Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.

The FDA issued an updated that provides a quick look at facts, figures, and highlights of the agency's response efforts. The FDA continues to take creative and flexible approaches to address access to critical medical products in response to COVID-19. In partnership with academic researchers, non-traditional manufacturers, communities of makers, and individuals who are banding together to support and fill local and national needs, the FDA is actively engaged and is developing ways to support these groups seeking to help their communities. Our goal is to help expand the availability of relevant products in ways that are consistent with the FDA’s public-health mission. For example, the FDA is with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Veterans Administration (VA), and America Makes to support non-traditional manufacturing approaches (e.g., 3D printing), to address device shortages including personal protective equipment (PPE). Through this partnership, 3D-printable designs for COVID response are assessed by the VA, and the NIH posts them on its . The FDA has, among other things, provided information on labeling and testing for face shields and face masks. Today, the FDA documents how this partnership has contributed to the number of medical devices — including PPE — and parts available to support the COVID-19 response since its launch 10 weeks ago. For example, 31 community-submitted designs passed the testing performed by VA clinics and were given clinically reviewed status. In addition, this effort has so far matched more than 272,000 3D-printed face shields and more than 230,000 3D-printed face masks with health care providers and others in need. The FDA has issued a On Tuesday, June 23, 12:00‒1:00 pm ET, the FDA, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), will host the on the topic of Importing Respirators for Health Care Personnel Use during COVID-19 Pandemic. The FDA updated its guidance, titled , to facilitate notification regarding device manufacturing interruptions or discontinuances. The FDA updated this guidance to include a that FDA recommends manufacturers consider in determining whether a notification under Section 506J of the FD&C Act is required during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, which added Section 506J to the FD&C Act, is an important step that advances FDA’s ability to prevent or mitigate potential medical device shortages during a public health emergency. FDA issued a that provides recommendations to pharmaceutical manufacturers on actions to take when an employee who has been directly involved in manufacturing drugs has a confirmed infection of COVID-19, symptoms of COVID-19, or has been exposed to an infected person. FDA’s recommendations are intended to help avoid negative effects on the safety and quality of drugs. FDA expects drug manufacturers to evaluate existing manufacturing controls to prevent drug safety or quality issues related to contamination from SARS-CoV-2. Drug manufacturers should also review regarding when employees may continue working following exposure or potential exposure to COVID-19 as well as procedures to minimize exposure and transmission in the workplace. FDA is not aware of any drugs that have been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 or of information indicating transmission of COVID-19 is associated with drugs. The FDA issued a warning letter to one company for selling fraudulent COVID-19 products, as part of the agency’s effort to protect consumers. The warned company, , offers cannabidiol (CBD) products for sale in the United States with misleading claims that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19 in people. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. The FDA issued a recommending that they stop using COVID-19 antibody tests that are listed on the FDA’s . The “removed” test list includes tests in which significant clinical performance problems were identified that cannot be or have not been addressed by the commercial manufacturer in a timely manner, tests for which an Emergency Use Authorization request has not been submitted by a commercial manufacturer of a serology test within a reasonable period of time as outlined in the FDA’s guidance, and tests voluntarily withdrawn by the respective commercial manufacturers.

Today, the FDA took steps to further support the development of by providing on its website a template that may be used to facilitate submission of requests for emergency use authorizations (EUA) for at-home sample collection kits. As explained in FDA’s guidance, Policy for COVID-19 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised), this template reflects FDA’s current thinking on the data and information that developers should submit to facilitate the EUA process. In particular, this template includes recommendations for use by laboratories and commercial manufacturers who may choose to use it to facilitate the preparation and submission of an EUA request. Currently, developers can offer a COVID-19 test for at-home self-collection where specifically authorized under an EUA or as part of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study. Testing updates: The first seller to whom FDA sent a warning letter was , which offers non-alcohol-based hand sanitizer products for sale in the United States with false or misleading claims including that the products maintain their effectiveness for up to 24 hours. Time-specific extended efficacy claims may give users the false impression that they need not rigorously adhere to interventions such as social distancing and engaging in good hygienic practices that have been demonstrated to curb the spread of COVID-19. The second seller to whom FDA sent a warning letter was , which offers copper “Germ Stopper” products for sale in the United States with misleading claims that the products are safe and/or effective for the prevention  of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 400 test developers who have already submitted, or said they will be submitting, EUA requests to the FDA for tests that detect the virus or antibodies to the virus.

According to the complaint, despite previous warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and repeated promises to correct violations, Sundial continued to violate the law and distribute their products. “Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective. Making claims that unproven drugs can cure or prevent diseases places consumers’ health at risk,” said FDA Chief Counsel Stacy Amin. “We remain committed to pursuing and taking swift action against those who attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA by repeatedly disregarding the law and distributing unapproved products.” The court concluded that Sundial’s products have no published adequate and well-controlled studies to support their claims, and the FDA has not approved any application for any of Sundial’s drugs, despite Sundial claiming that their products can cure, treat, or prevent a wide variety of diseases, including syphilis, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. For example, Sundial claimed that its Sundial Organic Hemp Seed Oil “suppresses the growth of cancer” and that Sundial Cassava Meal “prevents heart disease.” The FDA is particularly concerned that products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent serious diseases may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment. As a result of these violations, on May 27, 2020, U.S District Judge Edgardo Ramos in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order of permanent injunction against Rahsan Hakim and Adoniiah Rahsan, individuals doing business as Sundial Herbal Products. The complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the FDA, sought a permanent injunction against the Bronx, New York, drug distributor and its most responsible individuals. This action follows multiple FDA inspections conducted at Sundial between 2012 and 2017. The FDA issued a to Sundial in 2013 for similar violations. Despite assurances that the violations noted in the warning letter would be corrected, follow-up inspections revealed that the defendants did not make the necessary corrections. Under the injunction, Sundial and the individual defendants cannot directly or indirectly receive, label, hold or distribute drugs at or from their facility until they take certain steps to ensure that all of these products comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and other requirements listed in the order of permanent injunction including, among other requirements, recalling their drugs, hiring qualified experts to ensure conformity with the FD&C Act and other requirements and receiving written permission from the FDA to resume operations.

This is in response to physician requests for a waiver from the requirement for full IRB review. The guidance recommendations also address factors to consider when assessing potential benefits and risks for a particular patient being treated under expanded access. The FDA added a second ventilator developed by NASA to the list of that was issued in response to concerns relating to insufficient supply and availability of FDA-cleared ventilators for use in health care settings to treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NASA VITAL (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally) is intended to last three to four months and is specifically tailored to provide respiratory support for COVID-19 patients who are experiencing respiratory failure or insufficiency. Where the first NASA ventilator relied on wall gas as the pressure source, the second ventilator uses an internal compressor for its energy source. The device is designed to be built with components outside the current medical device supply chain and therefore does not impact the existing supply chain of currently made ventilators. The FDA added an emergency resuscitator for the Fitbit Flow to the list of . The Fitbit Flow is a continuous respiratory support system that includes an FDA-cleared Manual Resuscitator.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Takes Action to Protect Public Health; Increase Supply of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer", "date": "June 01, 2020", "contents": " Today, the FDA has taken additional action to help ensure widespread access to hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Consumer and health care personnel safety is a top priority for FDA, and an important part of FDA’s mission is to protect the public from harm, including as we seek to increase supply of hand sanitizer. To that end, we have updated our guidances to provide additional clarification on the manufacturing and compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products to help ensure that harmful levels of impurities are not present in ethanol used in hand sanitizer. The FDA appreciates industry’s willingness to help meet the increasing demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on during the public health emergency, as demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizer had dramatically increased, we issued temporary policies to provide flexibility to help meet this demand and to help get supply quickly to where it was needed, whether it was for health care professionals or for individuals and their families. Although it is our understanding that some larger hospital systems have been able to replenish their supply of hand sanitizer, we continue to hear that some smaller hospital systems and outpatient facilities are still experiencing difficulties accessing alcohol-based hand sanitizers. We also recognize that some consumers may not be able to find alcohol-based hand sanitizer in their local area, and, when they do, it is in limited quantities.  Washing our hands with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, continues to be one of our best defenses to prevent the spread of COVID-19. If soap and water are not readily available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol (also referred to as ethanol or ethyl alcohol). We previously updated these temporary guidances in April to reflect data submitted by fuel ethanol manufacturers producing ethanol via fermentation and distillation, indicating that at least some of their fuel ethanol products have harmful chemicals, including gasoline and benzene, which are known human carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). These impurities would not be expected from a typical fermentation and distillation process but may be present in the manufacturing environment of fuel or technical-grade ethanol, due to the use of certain chemicals, equipment or containers. The FDA is working with industry to ensure that harmful levels of impurities are not present if ethanol is used in these products. Based on careful review and consideration of available data, we are specifying interim levels of certain impurities that we have determined can be tolerated for a relatively short period of time, given the emphasis on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 public health emergency and to avoid exacerbating access issues for alcohol-based hand sanitizer. As with everything we do, the FDA is committed to ensuring that we appropriately balance risk and benefit. We believe that our temporary guidances sets the proper level of flexibility at the current time to help protect Americans during this public health emergency. We do not make any decision lightly and are continually assessing the needs and circumstances related to our temporary policies and how best to protect  public health. As relevant needs and circumstances evolve, the FDA intends to update, modify or withdraw these policies as appropriate. Consumers, manufacturers or distributors who have questions for the FDA regarding hand sanitizers should email or visit the on the FDA’s website. As increased hand sanitizer supply becomes available, consumers are reminded to keep hand sanitizers out of the reach of children (who may swallow hand sanitizers, particularly if they are scented, brightly colored or attractively packaged) and, in case of ingestion, to get medical help or contact a immediately. Very small amounts of hand sanitizer can be toxic, even lethal, to young children. Therefore, it is advisable that children should use such sanitizers with adult supervision.

{"title": "USDA, FDA Strengthen U.S. Food Supply Chain Protections ", "date": "May 19, 2020", "contents": " As the COVID-19 pandemic response continues, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been working around the clock on many fronts to support the U.S. food and agriculture sector so that Americans continue to have access to a safe and robust food supply. As a next step in carrying out , the USDA and FDA today announced a to help prevent interruptions at FDA-regulated food facilities, including fruit and vegetable processing. This is an important preparedness effort as we are approaching peak harvesting seasons, when many fruits and vegetables grown across the U.S. are sent to be frozen or canned. The MOU creates a process for the two agencies to make determinations about circumstances in which the USDA could exercise its authority under the Defense Production Act (DPA) with regard to certain domestic food resource facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, as well as to those that grow or harvest food that fall within the FDA’s jurisdiction. While the FDA will continue to work with state and local regulators in a collaborative manner, further action under the DPA may be taken, should it be needed, to ensure the continuity of our food supply. As needed, the FDA will work in consultation with state, local, tribal and territorial regulatory and public health partners; industry or commodity sector; and other relevant stakeholders (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration) to chart a path toward resuming and/or maintaining operations while keeping employees safe. We are extremely grateful to essential workers for everything they do every day to keep our pantries, refrigerators and freezers stocked. All of the food and agriculture sector -- whether it is regulated by the USDA or FDA -- are considered critical infrastructure, and it is vital for the public health that they continue to operate in accordance with guidelines from the CDC and OSHA regarding worker health and safety. As we work to get through the current challenge together, we remain committed to workers’ safety, as well as ensuring the availability of foods, and that our food remains among the safest in the world. On April 28, 2020, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 13917, Delegating Authority Under the Defense Production Act with Respect to the Food Supply Chain Resources During the National Emergency Caused by the Outbreak of COVID-19, delegating the powers of the President under the DPA to the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure continuity of operations for our nation’s food supply chain. The Executive Order gave the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to utilize the DPA if needed to require the fulfillment of contracts at food processing facilities. The MOU makes clear that the FDA will work with stakeholders to monitor the food supply for food resources not under the USDA’s exclusive jurisdiction in order to prevent interruptions at FDA-regulated food facilities. This action is another in a series of proactive steps the USDA and FDA have taken to maximize food availability following unprecedented disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic has caused to food supply chains that have been established and refined for decades. Our nation’s food and agriculture facilities and workers play an integral role in the continuity of our food supply chain. The USDA and FDA have been working to ensure that frontline workers in food facilities and retailers that have remained on the job during this crisis have the information and resources they need for business continuity and to continue working safely, which includes mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19. We continue to provide information and update frequently asked questions on both the ’s websites. We will continue to work with facilities and farms, CDC, OSHA, and state, tribal, and local officials to ensure facilities and farms are implementing practices consistent with federal worker safety guidelines to keep employees safe and continue operations. We are working with our federal partners who have the authority and expertise over worker safety to develop information on protecting worker health. We are also working with other federal partners to assist the food and agriculture industry in addressing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), cloth face coverings, disinfectants and sanitation supplies. Throughout the pandemic, the USDA and FDA have been closely monitoring the food supply chain for shortages in collaboration with industry and our federal and state partners. We are in regular contact with food manufacturers and grocery stores. We have issued guidances to ensure to safely reroute food that typically would be bought in bulk by food facilities and restaurants, like and flour, directly to consumers. As we continue to respond to COVID-19, we want to remind consumers that there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted by food or food packaging, as well as the importance of taking precautionary food safety steps to protect against foodborne illness pathogens such as Salmonella and E. Coli. With respect to the safety of food across the U.S., both the USDA and FDA continue to use their respective authorities, including conducting inspections, as appropriate. The agencies also continue to monitor foods for hazards, work with industry on any potential or reported issues in their facilities, and conduct food recalls when appropriate. This applies to both domestically produced food and food that is imported from other countries. Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, foodborne exposure is not known to be a route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. With respect to foodborne pathogens, the CDC, FDA and FSIS continue to work with state and local partners to investigate foodborne illness and outbreaks. During this coronavirus outbreak, we will continue to operate to prepare for, coordinate and carry out response activities to incidents of foodborne illness in both human and animal food."},
{"title": "FDA Releases Report on Investigation into Fall 2019 Outbreaks of Illnesses Tied to Romaine Lettuce", "date": "May 21, 2020", "contents": " As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is grateful for all that the food and agricultural sector is doing to provide safe and available food to consumers during this difficult time. As we work to get through the current challenge together, the FDA remains committed to protecting both the safety of workers and consumers from foodborne illness as we strive to ensure that America’s food supply remains resilient and among the safest in the world. As part of our ongoing efforts to combat foodborne illness, the FDA released the findings of an investigation into three outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses that occurred in Fall 2019, all tied to romaine lettuce, that suggests the proximity of cattle to produce fields may have been a contributing factor. The FDA worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state partners to investigate the contamination of romaine lettuce with several strains of E. coli O157:H7 that caused three outbreaks of foodborne illness beginning in September 2019 and which were declared over in January 2020. Some clusters (but not all) within each of these outbreaks were traced back to a common grower with multiple ranches/fields located in the Salinas, CA, growing region. Together, the outbreaks made 188 people ill. During the course of on-farm investigations, one of the outbreak strains of E. coli O157:H7 was detected in a sample on public land less than two miles upslope from a produce farm with multiple fields that were identified during the traceback investigations. Other Shiga toxin-producing strains of E. coli (STEC) were found in closer proximity to where romaine lettuce crops were grown, including two samples from the border area of a farm immediately next to cattle grazing land in the hills above leafy greens fields and two samples from on-farm water drainage basins. While these strains were not tied to the outbreaks, they do offer insight into the survival and movement of pathogens in this growing region. These findings, together with the findings from earlier leafy greens outbreaks, suggest that a potential contributing factor has been the proximity of cattle to the produce fields identified in traceback investigations. This is especially true when cattle are adjacent to and at higher elevations than produce fields. In the report, “ ,” we’re calling on leafy greens growers to assess and mitigate risks associated with adjacent and nearby land uses, including grazing lands and animal operations. Of note, the number of cattle observed on nearby lands during the 2019 investigations was far lower than the volume of a large Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, offering a useful reminder that high-density animal operations are not the only factor to consider. These key findings reinforce our concern about the possible impact of nearby and adjacent land use on the safety of leafy green crops and further underscore the importance of reviewing current operations and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies. FDA and its state regulatory partners have been working closely with the leafy greens industry to evaluate the factors that may be contributing to recurring outbreaks associated with romaine lettuce and other leafy greens. Today, the FDA is also calling on leafy greens growers to redouble their efforts and accelerate prevention through the following mitigation strategies: These and other recommendations are contained in the the FDA released in March of this year. Between 2009 and 2018, the FDA and the CDC identified 40 foodborne outbreaks of STEC infections in the U.S. with a confirmed or suspected link to leafy greens. At the FDA, we believe more can and must be done to prevent foodborne outbreaks linked to fresh leafy greens. This plan is designed to help foster a more urgent, collaborative and action-oriented approach in collaboration with the leafy greens industry, our state partners, academia and other stakeholders to advance work in three areas: prevention, response and addressing knowledge gaps. Our efforts to address prevention will include advancing the safety of agricultural water, enhancing inspection, audit and certifications programs and continuing focused sampling assignments. Our focus on response includes follow-up surveillance, advancing traceability and root cause analyses, and improving outbreak and recall communications. We are working to address knowledge gaps by studying the ecology of pathogens in the growing regions and mining data from earlier outbreaks tied to leafy greens. We are looking forward to strengthening our engagement with stakeholders to bring this action plan to fruition. While public health agencies have gotten better at detecting foodborne illnesses, our ability to determine the source of contaminated foods that may have caused the illnesses has lagged, due in part to the lack of modernized food traceability capabilities. Under the FDA’s initiative, we will be laser focused on prevention. We plan to use advances in technology to improve our ability to track and trace products through the supply chain. The New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint will be launched in the coming months, which will outline how we will advance our work in this area. This will help consumers get information more quickly, enabling people to better protect themselves and their families. We believe the entire fresh leafy green continuum can do better and we look forward to continuing our work with growers, processors, distributors and retailers in our shared efforts to protect consumers. Together, we’ll make progress on our overarching goal to give consumers the confidence they deserve in the safety of fresh leafy greens. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Prevent contamination from uphill adjacent cattle grazing lands, such as by produce farms increasing buffer zones if fields are adjacent to cattle grazing lands (based on assessment); and adding physical barriers such as berms, diversion ditches and vegetative strips. Assess and mitigate risks from nearby and adjacent lands that could impact growing areas or agricultural water sources. Increase digitization, interoperability and standardization of traceability records, which would expedite traceback and prevent further illnesses. Perform a root cause analysis when a foodborne pathogen is identified in produce and/or the growing environment."},

Specifically, the FDA issued an for the Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit. Everlywell’s kit is authorized to be used by individuals at home who have been screened using an online questionnaire that is reviewed by a health care provider. This allows an individual to self-collect a nasal sample at home using Everlywell’s authorized kit. The FDA has also authorized two COVID-19 diagnostic tests, performed at specific laboratories, for use with samples collected using the Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit. These tests have been authorized under separate, individual EUAs. Additional tests may be authorized for use with the Everlywell at-home collection kit in the future, provided data are submitted in an EUA request that demonstrate the accuracy of each test when used with the Everlywell at-home collection kit. “The authorization of a COVID-19 at-home collection kit that can be used with multiple tests at multiple labs not only provides increased patient access to tests, but also protects others from potential exposure,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic.” Today’s EUA for the Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit permits testing of a sample collected from inside the patient’s nose using the authorized self-collection kit that contains nasal swabs to collect a sample and a tube filled with saline to transport the sample back to a specified lab. Once patients self-swab to collect their nasal sample, they will ship the sample overnight to a specific CLIA-certified lab that is running one of the in vitro diagnostic molecular tests authorized under a separate EUA for use with the Everlywell at-home sample collection kit. The labs authorized to test specimens collected using the Everlywell at-home collection kit are .  Results will be returned to the patient through Everlywell’s independent physician network and their online portal. This announcement follows two recent EUAs for diagnostic tests that also use at-home specimen collection: one that uses a and another that . Everlywell’s EUA request leveraged data from studies supported by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and UnitedHealth Group to demonstrate stability of specimens during shipping.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Drug for Fourth-Line Treatment of Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "date": "May 15, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets as the first new drug specifically approved as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract. Qinlock is indicated for adult patients who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitor therapies, including imatinib. Each year, approximately 4,000 to 6,000 adults in the United States are diagnosed with a GIST. GISTs arise when abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs most commonly occur in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine but can start anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Qinlock is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it works by blocking a type of enzyme called a kinase, which helps keep the cancer cells from growing. Qinlock’s approval was based on the results of an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that enrolled 129 patients with advanced GIST who had received prior treatment with other FDA-approved targeted therapies, imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib. The trial compared patients who were randomized to receive Qinlock to patients who were randomized to receive placebo, to determine whether progression free survival (PFS) – the time from initial treatment in the clinical trial to growth of the cancer or death – was longer in the Qinlock group compared to the placebo group. During treatment in the trial, patients received Qinlock or placebo once a day in 28-day cycles, repeated until tumor growth was found (disease progression), or the patient experienced intolerable side effects. After disease progression, patients who were randomized to placebo were given the option of switching to Qinlock. On average, the PFS rate in patients in the Qinlock group was 6.3 months, compared to one month for patients in the placebo group. The most common side effects with Qinlock were alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia (muscle pain), diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (a skin reaction in the palms and soles) and vomiting. Qinlock can also cause serious side effects including skin cancer, hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiac dysfunction manifested as ejection fraction decrease (when the muscle of the left ventricle of the heart is not pumping as well as normal). Health care providers should routinely check for symptoms and signs of these and other risks of Qinlock. Qinlock may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Health care professionals should advise pregnant women of this risk and should advise both females of reproductive potential and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the last dose. Patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking Qinlock. The FDA granted this application designation, as well as designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Qinlock also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. This review used the , which streamlined data submission prior to the filing of the entire clinical application, and the , a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA’s assessment. FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada on the review of this application as part of . FDA approved Qinlock three months ahead of schedule.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has entered into an agreement with Aetion to collaborate on advanced analytical techniques to answer urgent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) research questions. The FDA and Aetion aim to answer questions about the use of diagnostics and medications in the pandemic, and risk factors for COVID-19-related complications in different patient populations. We believe that this work has the potential to contribute to the scientific evaluation of potential diagnostics and interventions for COVID-19. The FDA continues to work around the clock to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this effort, we recognize the potential for diverse, real-world data sources such as electronic health records, insurance claims, patient registries and lab results to further inform our science-based, all-of-America response to this unprecedented public health emergency. In recent years, the agency has taken steps to leverage modern, rigorous analyses of real-world data—such as data from the health care setting—to inform our work. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an urgency to these efforts and the FDA has worked quickly to advance collaborations with public and private partners to collect and analyze a variety of real-world data sources. Evaluation of real-world data has the potential to provide a wealth of rapid, actionable information to better understand disease symptoms, describe and measure immunity and understand available medical product supplies to help mitigate potential shortages. These data can also inform ongoing work to evaluate potential therapies, vaccines or diagnostics for COVID-19. The FDA is applying data from diverse sources to inform its response to COVID-19, including sources that were already available to the agency, such as . The urgency of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded that we expand our work to identify, access and analyze new datasets to widen the breadth of the information available. This work is being done in collaboration with partners in the U.S. government, academia and industry. For example, the FDA is a proud participant in the COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator, organized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research. The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator brings together leading experts in health data aggregation and analytics in a unified, collaborative effort to share insights, compare results and answer key questions to inform the collective COVID-19 response. By developing common data elements and questions, the Evidence Accelerator creates a strong foundation for rapid collection and rigorous analysis of real-world data to answer urgent questions about COVID-19. We are regularly engaging with stakeholders -- medical product industry leaders and scientists, academic researchers, technology companies, state and local governments and patient groups -- to hear from them on how we can come together as a public/private health community to harness the power of data during this emergency. We’re optimistic that these efforts will assist in, among other things, the FDA’s work to facilitate medical countermeasures to diagnose, treat and prevent COVID-19, mitigate any potential shortages in the medical product and food supply chains, ensure the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products and provide the industries we regulate the tools and flexibility to do the same.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Treatment for a Form of Bladder Dysfunction in Pediatric Patients as Young as 2 Years of Age", "date": "May 26, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted approval to VESIcare LS (solifenacin succinate) oral suspension, a liquid taken by mouth, for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a form of bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages two years and older. VESIcare (solifenacin succinate) tablets were initially approved in 2004 for the treatment of overactive bladder in adults 18 years and older. “This is the first FDA-approved treatment for NDO patients as young as two years of age,” said Christine P. Nguyen, M.D., acting director, FDA’s Division of Urology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “In addition, prior to today’s approval, the current standard of care for many of these patients required up to three times a day dosing, and this treatment requires only once a day dosing.” NDO is a dysfunction of the bladder that results from disease or injury in the nervous system. NDO may be related to congenital conditions (often-inherited conditions beginning at or before birth), such as spina bifida (myelomeningocele), or other conditions such as spinal cord injury. With NDO, there is overactivity of the bladder wall muscle, which normally relaxes to allow storage of urine. The bladder wall muscle overactivity results in sporadic bladder muscle contraction, which increases pressure in the bladder and decreases the volume of urine the bladder can hold. If NDO is not treated, increased pressure in the bladder can put the upper urinary tract at risk of harm, including possible permanent damage to the kidneys. In addition, spontaneous bladder muscle contractions can lead to unexpected and frequent leakage of urine with symptoms of urinary urgency (immediate urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than normal) and incontinence (loss of bladder control). The efficacy of VESIcare LS for this use was established in two clinical trials with a total of 95 pediatric NDO patients, ages two to 17 years old. The studies were designed to measure (as a primary efficacy endpoint) the maximum amount of urine the bladder could hold after 24 weeks of treatment. In the first study, 17 patients ages 2 to less than 5 years old were able to hold an average of 39 mL more urine than when the study began. In the second study, 49 patients ages five to 17 years were able to hold an average of 57 mL more urine than when the study began. Reductions in spontaneous bladder contractions, bladder pressure and number of incontinence episodes were also observed in both studies. The most common side effects of VESIcare LS are constipation, dry mouth and urinary tract infection. Somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness) has been reported with solifenacin succinate, the active ingredient in VESIcare LS. Patients of age who are able to drive or operate heavy machinery should not do so until they know how VESIcare LS affects them. Health care professionals are advised not to exceed the recommended starting dose of VESIcare LS in patients also taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Severe allergic reactions, such as angioedema (swelling beneath the skin) and anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate and may be life threatening. Patients should seek immediate attention if they experience swelling of the tongue or throat or difficulty breathing. VESIcare LS is not to be used in patients with gastric retention (reduced emptying of the stomach), uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma (fluid buildup in the eye which raises eye pressure) or hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to VESIcare LS or any of its components. VESIcare LS is also not recommended for use in patients with severe liver failure, clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction in the absence of clean intermittent catheterization, decreased gastrointestinal motility (slowed intestinal contractions), or at high risk of QT prolongation (an electrical disturbance where the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats), including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. The approval of VESIcare LS was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.

{"title": "FDA Approves Only Drug in U.S. to Treat Severe Malaria", "date": "May 26, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved artesunate for injection to treat severe malaria in adult and pediatric patients. Treatment of severe malaria with intravenous (IV) artesunate should always be followed by a complete treatment course of an appropriate oral antimalarial regimen. Prior to this approval, IV artesunate was only available to patients through the FDA’s Expanded Access program, which allowed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide IV artesunate to U.S. patients with severe malaria and to patients with uncomplicated malaria who are unable to take oral medications under an investigational new drug (IND) protocol. There has been no FDA-approved drug for treatment of severe malaria in the United States since the marketing of quinine was discontinued by the manufacturer in March 2019. According to the CDC, approximately 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year, with 300 of those infected having severe disease. Most people diagnosed with malaria in the United States acquire it during travel to countries with malaria. Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by a mosquito bite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness, and without appropriate treatment, they may develop severe complications, such as kidney failure, seizures, mental confusion, coma and death. The safety and efficacy of IV artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria was primarily evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Asia (Trial 1) and a supportive published randomized controlled trial in Africa (Trial 2). Trial 1 enrolled 1,461 patients who received either IV artesunate or the comparator drug quinine and included 202 pediatric patients younger than 15 years. Trial 2 included 5,425 randomized pediatric patients younger than 15 years of age with severe malaria who were treated with artesunate or quinine. In both trials, the number of patients treated with artesunate who died in the hospital was significantly lower than the number who died in the control group treated with quinine. In Trial 1, the most common adverse reactions in patients with malaria treated with IV artesunate were acute renal failure requiring dialysis, hemoglobinuria and jaundice. The safety profile in Trial 2 was generally similar to Trial 1. Artesunate should not be used in patients with known serious allergy to artesunate such as anaphylaxis. The FDA granted this application designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame and designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.  The FDA granted approval of artesunate for injection to Amivas.

Reference panels are an additional step to ensure the quality of the tests, validation of new assays, test calibration, and monitoring of assay performance. Nucleic acid tests identify infection by confirming the presence of a virus’ genetic material (RNA) and the FDA-supplied reference panel provides developers access to this material. The FDA’s reference panel is an independent performance validation step for diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection that are being used for clinical, not research, purposes. The FDA panel is available to commercial and laboratory developers who are interacting with the FDA through the “The FDA has taken many steps during this pandemic to ensure that Americans have access to trustworthy diagnostic tests. Today’s reference panel will provide test developers with well-characterized reagents to compare the performance of different molecular diagnostic tests under the same conditions,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). “We are continuously evaluating our policies and approaches on diagnostic tests during this pandemic, including addressing poorly performing tests. We are committed to remaining flexible and providing more resources to developers as necessary, based on our regulatory expertise, real-world experience, and data, in order to protect and promote public health.” These types of reference panels have proven to be an invaluable resource in the development of accurate, reliable, and validated diagnostic tests for detecting infectious diseases. The FDA has provided similar tools to assist industry in developing tests for other infectious diseases. For example, since the Zika outbreak in 2015, through the collaborative work between CDRH and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the FDA has responded to the need to directly compare the performance of different diagnostic assays by developing and producing reference panels. This work resulted in the FDA making available first a for molecular-based diagnostic tests, and then a panel of human plasma samples to support the regulatory evaluation of serological tests to detect recent Zika virus infection. By providing this new tool to aid in the evaluation of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the FDA continues its public health mandate in combatting this pandemic.

This will continue as local, national and international conditions warrant, with the exception of certain mission critical inspections. Mission critical inspections are identified on a case-by-case basis and conducted with appropriate safety measures in place. In this unprecedented time, we are working hard to help ensure the safety and integrity of the products we all need, while striking an appropriate balance between a scaled back surveillance inspection program and the continuation of providing robust regulatory oversight. While this pandemic has added new complexities to our normal operations, we have implemented to on-site surveillance inspections that provide us with useful information toward fulfilling the agency’s mission. The FDA is collaborating with the CDC to develop a process that would govern how and where to return to on-site facility surveillance inspections in accordance with the gating criteria outlined in the . We expect this to be a phased approach driven by scientific data. Our priority and commitment are to first protect the health and well-being of not only our own highly skilled workforce and state contract inspectors, but also the health of workers in the important industries we regulate. Although inspections are critical, they are one part of a robust and multi-pronged approach to overseeing the safety and quality of FDA regulated products. Safety and quality must be part of the daily routine at any regulated facility for their products to be high quality and reliably suitable for the U.S. consumer. Based on decades of experience with our diverse regulated industries, we believe most FDA-regulated firms understand and appreciate their responsibility to ensure the safety of the products they manufacture or produce. We consider these firms to be our partners in public health. The FDA’s regulatory oversight of crucial industry sectors is vital to the long-term health of America, but product safety and quality are ultimately the establishment’s responsibility. Most firms strive to reliably provide quality products and maintain the integrity of the supply chain. We are in steady communication with our industry partners as well as our domestic and foreign regulatory counterparts to assist them during this difficult time. Our leadership team meets daily to discuss the urgent issues facing us as we facilitate efforts to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease; survey the medical and food product supply chains for potential shortages or disruptions and help to mitigate such impacts, as necessary; and leverage the full breadth of our public health tools. We continue to closely monitor the global situation and remain in contact with our domestic and foreign regulatory counterparts to inform our assessment of the feasibility of a return to routine on-site surveillance inspections as conditions improve.

These guidance documents aim to make the process for submitting applications to initiate studies for new drugs and biological products more efficient and outline recommendations for ways to design clinical trials to evaluate safety and effectiveness of these medical products for COVID-19. “Our staff continues to work around the clock with the world’s best innovators and researchers to help expedite the development of prevention and treatment options for COVID-19,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Accelerating the investigation of safe and effective therapies that could benefit people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the FDA’s highest priorities. We are committed to maximizing our regulatory flexibility and using every tool at our disposal to speed the development and availability of these medical products and believe these new guidances will help innovators and researchers do just that.” Quickly after the emergence of this virus, the FDA began working directly with federal health partners, academia and industry to advance medical countermeasures against COVID-19. Given the urgent nature of the pandemic, the FDA launched a new program called the to help move new medical products to patients as soon as possible, while at the same time determine whether they are effective and if the benefits outweigh the risks. So far, more than 130 clinical trials of potential COVID-19 related drugs and biological products are underway with FDA oversight and additional development programs for other agents are in the planning stages. These include studies on therapies such as antiviral drugs to keep viruses from multiplying, as well as therapies called immunomodulators aimed at tamping down the body’s own immune reaction to the virus, in cases where the body starts attacking the patient’s own organs. Studies like these, which are conducted by the pharmaceutical industry and academic researchers, assess the products’ toxicity and help to find out if they work against COVID-19. The FDA has started to receive data from clinical studies and expects to receive more data regarding investigational products soon. The agency intends to engage with pharmaceutical sponsors and other government partners to facilitate patient access as soon as possible when favorable results are observed. The guidances issued today build on steps the agency has taken to streamline its review and advice process to get studies started as quickly as possible, and they incorporate information provided to individual innovators or researchers over the past several months. The first guidance, “ ,” outlines a more efficient process for developers to receive agency feedback on their supporting data with the goal of starting clinical trials as soon as possible. The FDA is committed to helping sponsors get potentially effective products into study quickly, while protecting the safety of patients. To that end, the guidance provides sponsors clarity on the types of data and information they should provide to address clinical, nonclinical and quality considerations before submitting an application to initiate studies. The second guidance, “ ,” provides the FDA’s current recommendations on later stage clinical trials intended to establish safety and effectiveness for COVID-19 products. The guidance outlines critical sponsor considerations such as appropriate patient selection, including the evaluation of therapies in patients at high risk of complications from COVID-19 (e.g., the elderly). In addition, the guidance helps sponsors to understand how to design their trials, including considerations of study duration, assessment of efficacy and monitoring for safety. The FDA anticipates this guidance will help sponsors to efficiently design studies that may lead to the review and potential approval of safe and effective drugs and biological products to address the COVID-19 pandemic. These guidance documents are supplemented by a variety of ongoing activities and broad agency guidance to support innovative study designs, including master protocols, to test multiple products and multiple populations simultaneously and get answers on safety and efficacy as quickly as possible. In addition to the FDA’s work to expedite preventative and therapeutic options, the agency is engaged in a with the National Institutes of Health and others to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options. The Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership, which also includes other U.S. and European government partners and more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies, will develop a collaborative framework for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates, streamlining clinical trials, coordinating regulatory processes and/or leveraging assets among all partners to rapidly respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Because of the anticipated volume and nature of this information, the FDA granted Bayer’s request for a variance from some medical device reporting requirements but imposed conditions for reporting to ensure protection of the public health. Under the conditions, Bayer is required to start providing reportable adverse events to the FDA in July 2020 and continue submitting additional reportable events identified through review of the information on a monthly basis. The FDA will make these events publicly available on its webpage. The conditions the FDA developed for this particular variance also require Bayer to submit summaries of the reportable events that include information such as the type of event (death, serious injury or malfunction), a description of the reported patient events or device problems, and patient demographics. These summaries will be accessible through the FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The FDA continues to require that Bayer submit Essure-associated reportable events, outside of the events specifically covered in this variance, in accordance with current medical device reporting requirements. This variance will expire after one year, unless the FDA grants an extension, at which time, Bayer will be required to follow the regular adverse event reporting requirements for all Essure-associated reportable events. In addition to providing summary information that will be available in MAUDE, Bayer is required to provide quarterly and final analysis reports evaluating the events reported under the variance and how the information compares to other medical device reports (MDRs) for Essure.

These risks, which are in the drug labels for their approved uses, may be mitigated when health care professionals closely screen and supervise these patients such as in a hospital setting or a clinical trial, as indicated in the for these drugs to treat COVID-19. “We understand that health care professionals are looking for every possible treatment option for their patients and we want to ensure we’re providing them with the appropriate information needed for them to make the best medical decisions,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered. We encourage health care professionals making individual patient decisions closely screen and monitor those patients to help mitigate these risks. The FDA will continue to monitor and investigate these potential risks and will communicate publicly when more information is available.” The FDA has issued an to allow hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and used in limited circumstances, such as for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These drugs are able to be distributed from the SNS to states for doctors to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets with important information about using these drugs in treating COVID-19, including the known risks and drug interactions, as well as appropriate screening and monitoring, be made available to health care providers and patients. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also FDA-approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. These medicines have not been proven safe or effective for treating COVID-19. However, clinical trials are underway and additional trials are being planned to determine if these drugs can benefit patients with COVID-19. These trials are also examining whether the drugs can prevent COVID-19 among health care workers, first responders or people who have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Once the FDA has approved a drug, health care providers generally may prescribe or administer the drug for an unapproved use, including in clinical settings not described in the approved labeling. This decision will be based on their assessment of the potential benefits versus the risks for their patient, recognizing that the FDA has not assessed the safety or effectiveness of such use. For this reason, it is important that health care providers are aware of the risks of serious and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems that can occur with these drugs and are included in the drug labels for their approved uses. As noted in the Drug Safety Communication, the FDA has reviewed – and continues to investigate – case reports in the , published medical literature and the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System concerning serious heart-related adverse events and death in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, either alone or combined with the antibiotic azithromycin or other medicines. These adverse events included abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death. Patients who also have other health issues such as heart and kidney disease are likely to be at increased risk of these heart problems when receiving these medicines.

The FDA authorized the for COVID-19. Specifically, the FDA re-issued the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) COVID-19 RT-PCR Test to permit testing of samples self-collected by patients at home using LabCorp’s Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kit. Today’s reissued EUA permits testing of a sample collected from the patient’s nose using a designated self-collection kit that contains nasal swabs and saline. After patients self-swab to collect their nasal sample, they mail their sample, in an insulated package, to a LabCorp lab for testing. LabCorp intends to make the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor’s order, in the coming weeks. The FDA issued an EUA for the emergency use of the for use in decontaminating compatible N95 or N95-equivalent respirators for single-user reuse by healthcare providers to prevent exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates when there are insufficient supplies of face-filtering respirators (FFRs) resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sterilucent Sterilizer System is an FDA-cleared sterilization system for terminal sterilization of certain types of medical devices. This EUA authorizes expansion of the indication for decontamination of compatible N95 respirators for up to 10 decontamination cycles per respirator. A new FDA Voices was issued, . It explains how the agency is working closely with the food industry and with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide flexibility regarding federal food labeling and other requirements when possible, so consumers have access to the food they want. To achieve that goal, the FDA has issued temporary guidance that provides flexibility to various segments of the food industry—restaurants, food manufacturers, producers and retail establishments—to help support the food supply chain and meet consumer demand in this time of crisis. Yesterday, the FDA approved an for the relief of bronchospasm in patients 2 to 12 years of age with asthma.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Therapy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer That Has Spread, Not Responded to Other Treatments", "date": "April 22, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for the treatment of adult patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Patients must have received at least two prior therapies before taking Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a Trop-2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor drug conjugate, meaning that the drug targets the Trop-2 receptor that helps the cancer grow, divide and spread, and is linked to topoisomerase inhibitor, which is a chemical compound that is toxic to cancer cells. Approximately two of every 10 breast cancer diagnoses worldwide are triple-negative. Triple-negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that tests negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein. Therefore, triple-negative breast cancer does not respond to hormonal therapy medicines or medicines that target HER2. The FDA approved Trodelvy based on the results of a clinical trial of 108 patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who had received at least two prior treatments for metastatic disease. The efficacy of Trodelvy was based on the overall response rate (ORR) – which reflects the percentage of patients that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage. The ORR was 33.3%, with a median duration of response of 7.7 months. Of the patients with a response to Trodelvy, 55.6% maintained their response for 6 or more months and 16.7% maintained their response for 12 or more months. The prescribing information for Trodelvy includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of severe neutropenia (abnormally low levels of white blood cells) and severe diarrhea. Health care professionals should monitor patient’s blood cell counts periodically during treatment with Trodelvy and consider treatment with a type of therapy called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which stimulates the bone marrow to produce white blood cells called granulocytes and stem cells and releases them into the bloodstream, to help prevent infection, and should initiate anti-infective treatment in patients with febrile neutropenia (development of fever when white blood cell are abnormally low). Additionally, health care professionals should monitor patients with diarrhea and give fluid, electrolytes, and supportive care medications, as needed. Trodelvy may need to be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued for neutropenia or diarrhea. Trodelvy can cause hypersensitivy reactions including severe anaphylactic (allergic) reactions. Patients should be monitored for infusion-related reactions and health care professionals should discontinue Trodelvy if severe or life-threatening reactions occur. If patients experience nausea or vomiting while taking Trodelvy, health care professionals should use antiemetic preventive treatment, to prevent nausea and vomitting. Patients with reduced uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) activity are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of Trodelvy treatment. The most common side effects for patients taking Trodelvy were nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, vomiting, alopecia (hair loss), constipation, decreased appetite, rash and abdominal pain. Women who are pregnant should not take Trodelvy because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The FDA advises health care professionals to inform females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Trodelvy and for 6 months after the last dose. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should also use effective contraception during treatment with Trodelvy and for three months after the last dose. Trodelvy was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on a result that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to verify and describe Trodelvy’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Trodelvy was also granted designation, which expedites the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The FDA granted approval of Trodelvy to Immunomedics, Inc.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Court Grants FDA’s Request for Extension of Premarket Review Submission Deadline for Certain Tobacco Products Because of Impacts from COVID-19", "date": "April 23, 2020", "contents": " On July 12, 2019, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland ordered the FDA to require manufacturers of e-cigarettes, cigars and other deemed new tobacco products that were on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016 to submit applications for premarket review by May 12, 2020. We have steadily been working toward that deadline, but the coronavirus pandemic has drastically impaired the ability to adhere to this timeline. Solely as a result of the pandemic and these exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, we requested on March 30, and on April 22, 2020 were granted by the court, a 120-day extension of the May 12 deadline. The court order means applications for premarket review for many e-cigarettes, cigars and other new tobacco products are now required to be filed by Sept. 9, 2020. Consistent with the original court order, for companies that submit timely applications, the agency may continue to exercise enforcement discretion, meaning their products would generally continue to be marketed without being subject to FDA enforcement actions, for up to one year from the deadline (up to Sept. 9, 2021), unless a negative action is taken by the FDA on an application during that time. Requesting this extension was not an easy decision for the FDA. COVID-19 is impacting all FDA-regulated industries, including tobacco product manufacturers. The agency has received numerous inquiries from the tobacco industry expressing concern they will be unable to complete premarket applications by the original May 12 deadline due to disruptions at all stages of preparation, including preventions or disruptions to in-person laboratory work and clinical studies or necessary foreign travel, or from the shuttering of manufacturing facilities abroad. At this time, the FDA believes the public health is better protected by not having these firms compromise their employees’ health or take actions that would risk spreading COVID-19 to others by trying to meet the previous May 12 deadline. In the more than a dozen requests for an extension that the FDA received, this public health concern was mentioned repeatedly. Another consideration was that a number of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) personnel have been deployed to work on COVID-19 pandemic issues for the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), leaving fewer staff to process applications. Many of those deployed are among the staff that had been playing a critical role as CTP prepared for this deadline. In addition, we are expecting more PHS deployments among the staff involved in these preparations, and the length of deployment for many of these PHS officers is likely to be extended. Ultimately, a Sept. 9 deadline will better serve the public health by allowing manufacturers to prepare for, and the Agency to conduct, the thorough scientific review of these products that is required under law and vital to our mission of protecting Americans while reducing or eliminating physical contact during this critical period. Importantly, this new deadline does not detract from our efforts to prioritize enforcement of certain e-cigarette products currently on the market. Although the FDA’s in-person compliance checks and vape shop inspections are currently on hold due to the pandemic, review of previous inspections continues, and we continue to monitor the online marketplace and will take action as appropriate. Accordingly, the , which independently prioritizes earlier enforcement against certain e-cigarette products that are widely used by youth, remains in effect regardless of whether an application is submitted, although we intend to update it for products for which the Sept. 9 date now applies. Since the FDA began implementing the January 2020 guidance on Feb. 6, 2020, we have conducted more than 2,300 inspections of brick-and-mortar and online retailers and manufacturers. Physical inspections conducted prior to being halted due to COVID-19 concerns revealed the presence of certain flavored cartridge or pod-based ENDS products subject to current enforcement and warning letters have already been sent to 40 retailers. The FDA remains acutely aware of the recent surge in youth use of e-cigarettes and the public health imperative that these and other deemed new tobacco products undergo premarket review. We are committed to implementing the enforcement priorities outlined in the January 2020 guidance. Again, we struggled with the decision to request an extension of the May 12 deadline, but this was ultimately the decision that made the most sense for public health during this extraordinary time. In the meantime, we strongly encourage applicants who are able to submit their applications to do so as soon as possible. Those that plan on submitting applications for a large number of products are encouraged to contact the Agency as soon as possible to discuss their plans and method of submission. Sharing information about the number and nature of applications being developed will help us to prepare more efficiently for the influx of applications, enabling review of quality applications.

The warning letters were sent to establishments marketing unauthorized products, such as a backpack and sweatshirt designed with stealth pockets to hold and conceal an e-cigarette, ENDS products that resemble smartwatches, or devices appearing as children’s toys such as a portable video game system or fidget spinner. Warning letters were also issued to companies marketing e-liquids that imitate packaging for food products that often are marketed and appeal to youth, such as candy, or feature cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants. These warning letters are part of the against ENDS and other deemed tobacco products illegally on the market. The warning letters are also in line with the agency’s stated against any ENDS product targeted to youth or likely to promote use by youth. If the recipients of these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, distribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, they risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure and/or civil money penalty actions. The following retailers and/or manufacturers or importers received a These products appeal to youth in the way they are designed and labeled. For example, Vaprwear Gear’s pullover and backpack products hold pod systems that deliver vapor through hosing discreetly woven through hidden pockets. This design allows the products to be used for vaping without raising the attention of parents, teachers or other adults.

The FDA continues to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on its programmatic activities and will continue to communicate any changes as they occur. Guided by health and safety considerations, the FDA will continue taking appropriate actions, as outlined by its priorities, on a rolling basis. These warning letters notify the retailers and manufacturers that new ENDS products without a marketing authorization order are adulterated and misbranded, and selling or distributing these products to customers in the U.S. is prohibited under the FD&C Act. Retailers and distributors are encouraged to communicate with their suppliers to discuss possible options for the unauthorized products in their inventory.

The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Today, the FDA issued a new explaining Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), one of several tools FDA uses to help make important medical products available quickly during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. As the explains, EUAs provide more timely access to drugs, diagnostic tests and/or other critical medical products that can help diagnose, treat and/or prevent COVID-19. When deciding whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the available scientific evidence very quickly and carefully balances any known and potential benefits and/or risks of these products to the public. The FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to two companies for selling fraudulent COVID-19 products, as part of the agency’s effort to protect consumers. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. As part of its work to help protect public health, FDA with information about smoking and COVID-19. Smoking cigarettes can leave smokers more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, which is why there’s never been a better time to quit smoking. FDA’s campaign has supportive tips and tools to help smokers get closer to quitting for good. Today, the FDA posted to assist manufacturers submitting generic drug applications with bioequivalence studies that may be impacted during COVID-19. Diagnostics update to date: The first seller warned, , offers essential oils and herbal products for sale in the U.S. with misleading claims that the products are safe and/or effective for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The second seller warned, , the “DefendTM Patch,” a transdermal patch containing a “composition of botanical oils,” for sale in the U.S. with misleading claims that the product is safe and/or effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 380 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for tests that detect the virus. To date, the FDA has issued 50 individual for test kit manufacturers and laboratories. In addition, 22 authorized tests have been added to the EUA letter of authorization for high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has been notified that more than 230 laboratories have begun testing under the policies set forth in our COVID-19 Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency Guidance.

{"title": "FDA Grants Marketing of New Device for Continuous Dialysis Therapy for use in Pediatric Patients with Certain Kidney Conditions", "date": "April 29, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms (or 5.5 to 22 pounds). Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy – known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) – involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient’s blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population (2.5 and 10 kilograms; or 5.5 to 22 pounds) who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). Approximately 10,000 children develop acute kidney injury in the U.S. These children typically receive therapy in ICU settings and only have a survival rate of 38-43 percent. They need dialysis to survive. However, existing CRRT devices available on the U.S. market are primarily intended for use in patients weighing at least 20 kilograms (or 44 pounds) and, therefore, are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms (or 5.5 to 22 pounds) nor are they accurate enough to optimally treat these pediatric patients. The CARPEDIEM System is intended to address this unmet need for pediatric patients between 2.5 and 10 kilograms (or 5.5 to 22 pounds). The CARPEDIEM System was designed for extracorporeal blood treatment – a purification process that takes place outside the body returning the purified blood back to the patient. This was accomplished by optimizing technological features on legally marketed CRRT devices by miniaturizing the technology to meet the clinical needs of very small pediatric patients. The FDA evaluated data from an independent patient registry, the CARPEDIEM European Registry, and compared the results to control patient data from the United States Prospective Pediatric CRRT Registry. Data showed a 97 percent survival rate to discontinuation of CRRT in patients weighing less than 10 kilograms (or 22 pounds) treated with the CARPEDIEM System, compared to a 48% survival rate to discontinuation of CRRT in pediatric patients (controls) treated with currently cleared devices for CRRT marketed for adults. The survival rate at discharge from the ICU was 55% in patients treated with the CARPEDIEM System compared to 43% in patients treated with other CRRT devices. In addition, pediatric patients treated with the CARPEDIEM System exhibited a significant decline in the percent of body fluid overload (FO), a measure that has been shown to be associated with higher mortality rates in children receiving CRRT. At the beginning of treatment, patients started with 20% of FO, but at the end their FO had decreased to 5%. While the rates of complications reported from the CARPEDIEM European Registry were low, potential complications include weight scale alarm and low blood pressure. Potential complications associated with how the device functions include air in the dialysis circuit, transducer (assures that blood remains in the dialysis circuit) alarm and high pressure in the blood filter (dialyzer). As part of the marketing authorization, the manufacturer will maintain a post-approval study to document real-world treatments of the device in the U.S. The study will gather data on patient survival rates after discontinuation of CRRT and timing of discharge from the ICU so the manufacturer can update labeling as needed to help ensure its safe and effective use by the wider pediatric nephrologist community. The FDA reviewed the device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic Inc. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Throughout this public health emergency, we’ve continued to execute our review activities while responding to the public health needs of the current COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to perform our user fee review activities and our application review teams across the agency remain focused on their work as we do everything possible to maintain continuity of operations in a very dynamic situation. Part of these actions include looking at ways to use technology and established agreements with our foreign counterparts to minimize impact to applications under review. On the prescription drugs and biologics side, our Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and our Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) staff are working diligently, both to address challenges with the ongoing outbreak and to carry out our on-going duty to safeguard public health while helping to ensure that safe and effective, high-quality drugs and biologics are available to the public. At this time, the New Drug Program, the Generic Drug Program, and the Biologics and Biosimilars Programs are continuing to meet key review program user fee performance goals, approve applications and communicate with applicants. With many staff working on COVID-19 activities, it is possible that we will not be able to sustain our current level of performance indefinitely. Our staffs are working at full capacity and we are striving to ensure that the drug programs continue to see minimal interruptions during this time. However, if there is an increase in drugs shortages and supply disruptions, we will be ready to reprioritize more of this work, as necessary. On the devices side, our Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and CBER continue to meet all of their Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA) review goals. We have taken steps to contact industry stakeholders to convert each previously scheduled meeting through May to a teleconference. For marketing applications on hold, we are further by 90 days for Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), Premarket Approval (PMA) applications (original and supplements), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) applications (original and supplements) and De Novo classification requests. It is likely this extension of time will have an impact on the FDA and industry’s ability to meet the shared outcome goals for total time to decision as listed in the MDUFA IV commitment letter. Additionally, with many staff in CDRH working on COVID-19 activities related to pre-Emergency Use Authorizations (pre-EUAs), EUAs, and Immediately In Effect (IIE) guidance documents, it is possible that we will not be able to sustain our current level of performance indefinitely. However, this will be assessed on an ongoing basis. For animal drug and generic animal drug user fee programs, our Center for Veterinary Medicine continues to meet all of its user fee-related performance goals and does not currently anticipate a change in our ability to meet these performance goals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our staff is currently in a primarily telework environment and is utilizing teleconferencing tools to continue communicating with sponsors in lieu of in-person meetings. To help minimize the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on new animal drug development, we issued for industry stakeholders on the conduct and review of studies to support new animal drug development. We are also closely monitoring the potential for new animal drug shortages and supply chain disruptions, and we are working closely with sponsors to address these challenges, as appropriate. It is difficult to speculate on what the exact impact will be on incoming submissions moving forward. We are seeing and hearing from industry that companies are taking a role as partners in the defense of the public health by prioritizing their work and submissions. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, the FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible as we work to address the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as keep other key mission-critical initiatives unrelated to the pandemic moving forward.

People should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider. The FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a warning letter to a seller of fraudulent COVID-19 products, as part of the agency’s effort to protect consumers. The seller warned, , offers homeopathic drug products for sale in the U.S. that are unapproved and misbranded with misleading claims the products are safe and/or effective for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. The FDA posted tips on and a downloadable . These materials reassure consumers that there is currently no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. posted on the FDA’s webpage, Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response Frank Yiannas talks about the state of the U.S. food supply, both now and beyond this public health crisis. The topics he covers include food safety and food availability, as well as an update on implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act and plans to release a blueprint for the New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative. The FDA issued a for immediate implementation setting forth a temporary policy for outsourcing facilities to compound certain human drugs for hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This guidance is being issued to provide patient access to treatment options for COVID-19 when hospitals experience difficulties accessing certain FDA-approved drugs. FDA does not intend to take action against outsourcing facilities that prepare certain compounded drugs, as described in the guidance, for hospitals that treat patients with COVID-19. The FDA added content to the question-and-answer appendix in its guidance titled “ .” The updated guidance includes new content on conducting remote clinician-reported outcome or performance outcome assessments; remote site monitoring; requirements; investigational product administration by a local health care provider who is not a sub-investigator; and information for sponsors on who they should contact at the FDA regarding certain changes to ongoing trials. There is also updated information about obtaining informed consent from a patient who is unable to travel to the clinical trial site due to COVID-19 illness or travel restrictions, in situations where electronic informed consent is not an option. The FDA issued to help expand the availability of telethermographic systems used for body temperature measurements for triage use for the duration of the public health emergency. The advantage of these systems for initial temperature assessment for triage use is the potential use in high throughput areas (such as airports, businesses, warehouses, and factories) and in settings where other temperature assessment products may be in short supply. Diagnostics update: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 315 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for COVID-19 tests. To date, 37 have been issued for COVID-19 tests.

As part of this effort, U.S. Cotton, the largest manufacturer of cotton swabs and a subsidiary of Parkdale-Mills, developed a polyester-based Q-tip-type swab that is fully synthetic for compatibility with COVID-19 testing. Harnessing its large-scale U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities, U.S. Cotton plans to produce these new polyester swabs in large quantities to help meet the needs for coronavirus diagnostic testing. “This action today demonstrates the ingenuity that results from the FDA working in partnership with the private sector. The Trump Administration has been working side-by-side with our industry partners to fight this pandemic, and today is a great example of that work. We appreciate work by UnitedHealth Group, Quantigen, and the Gates Foundation to perform and support the clinical studies necessary for this advancement. We also want to acknowledge U.S. Cotton’s efforts to manufacture a new type of swab for COVID-19 testing that can be produced at scale. We appreciate the work of these collaborators to consider how these test supplies could be broadly distributed to meet not only the testing needs of the United States but also global needs around the pandemic. All of these actions by these American organizations will help continue to expand our testing capability,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. This finding that spun synthetic swabs could be used for COVID-19 testing is based on results from a clinical investigation that represents a collaboration between the FDA, UnitedHealth Group, the Gates Foundation, and Quantigen. The type of testing at the front of the nose used in this study is notable because it allows self-collection by patients thereby limiting exposure of healthcare providers; it is more comfortable for patients and it can be performed by a swab that is more readily available and manufacturable at scale. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves First New Drug Under International Collaboration, A Treatment Option for Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer ", "date": "April 17, 2020", "contents": " Today, as part of , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tukysa (tucatinib) in combination with chemotherapy (trastuzumab and capecitabine) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced forms of HER2-positive breast cancer that can’t be removed with surgery, or has spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, and who have received one or more prior treatments. The FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada, Health Sciences Authority (HSA, Singapore) and Swissmedic (SMC, Switzerland) on this review. This is the first Project Orbis partnership between the FDA, HSA and Swissmedic. While the FDA approved Tukysa today, the application is still under review at the other agencies. Collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions, regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval. Early availability of new therapies and adoption as standard of care around the world may have an impact on the increasingly international conduct of cancer clinical trials, potentially accelerating the development of anticancer products. With a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs, Project Orbis facilitates a collaborative review to identify any regulatory divergence across review teams. HER2-positive breast cancer, which makes up approximately one-fifth of breast cancers, has too much of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. More than 25% of women with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer will develop brain metastases. Tukysa is a kinase inhibitor meaning it blocks a type of enzyme (kinase) and helps prevent the cancer cells from growing. Tukysa is approved for treatment after patients have taken one or more anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The FDA approved Tukysa based on the results of a clinical trial enrolling 612 patients who had HER2-positive advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer and had prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Patients with previously treated and stable brain metastases, as well as those with previously treated and growing or untreated brain metastases, were eligible for the clinical trial, and 48% of enrolled patients had brain metastases at the start of the trial. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time when there was no growth of the tumor. The median PFS in patients who received Tukysa, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 7.8 months compared to 5.6 months in those patients who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine. Overall survival and PFS in patients with brain metastases at baseline were key secondary endpoints. The median overall survival in patients who received Tukysa, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 21.9 months compared to 17.4 months in patients who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine. The median PFS in patients with brain metastases at baseline who received Tukysa, trastuzumab and capecitabine was 7.6 months compared to 5.4 months in patients who received placebo, trastuzumab and capecitabine. Common side effects for patients taking Tukysa were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (burning or tingling discomfort in the hands and feet), nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), vomiting, stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia and rash. Tukysa can cause serious side effects including severe diarrhea associated with dehydration, acute kidney injury and death. Health care professionals should advise patients to notify their health care provider and start antidiarrheals as clinically indicated if diarrhea occurs. If patients are experiencing severe diarrhea, Tukysa should be interrupted or the dosage reduced. Tukysa can also cause severe hepatotoxicity. Health care professionals should monitor liver tests in patients taking Tukysa every three weeks while the patient is on treatment or as clinically indicated. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Tukysa because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tukysa and for at least one week after the last dose. The FDA also advises patients refer to the Full Prescribing Information of trastuzumab and capecitabine for pregnancy and contraception information. In addition to the international collaboration with TGA, Health Canada, HSA Singapore and SMC Switzerland, this review used the which can streamline the submission of data prior to the completion and submission of the entire clinical application. RTOR, as well as the , facilitated discussions among the regulatory agencies and regulatory review. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Tukysa was also granted designation, which expedites the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Targeted Treatment for Patients with Cholangiocarcinoma, a Cancer of Bile Ducts", "date": "April 17, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Pemazyre (pemigatinib), the first treatment approved for adults with certain types of previously treated, advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare form of cancer that forms in bile ducts, which are slender tubes that carry the digestive fluid bile from the liver to gallbladder and small intestine. Today’s approval is for patients with cholangiocarcinoma that is locally advanced (when cancer has grown outside the organ it started in, but has not yet spread to distant parts of the body) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) and who have tumors that have a fusion or other rearrangement of a gene called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). At diagnosis, a majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma have advanced disease, meaning that the disease is no longer treatable with surgery. For these patients, until today, there have been no FDA-approved therapies; a combination of chemotherapy drugs has been the standard initial treatment. FGFR2 fusions have been found in the tumors of approximately 9% to 14% of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Pemazyre is a tablet that works by blocking FGFR2 in tumor cells to prevent them from growing and spreading. Pemazyre’s approval was based on the results of a clinical trial that enrolled 107 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement who had received prior treatment. During the clinical trial, patients received Pemazyre once a day for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off, in 21-day cycles until the disease progressed or the patient experienced an unreasonable level of side effects. To assess how well Pemazyre was working during the trial, patients were scanned every eight weeks. The trial used established criteria to measure how many patients experienced a complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). The overall response rate was 36%, with 2.8% of patients having a complete response and 33% having a partial response. Among the 38 patients who had a response, 24 patients (63%) had a response lasting 6 months or longer and 7 patients (18%) had a response lasting 12 months or longer. The most common adverse reactions occurring in 20% or more of patients who received Pemazyre are hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia (electrolyte disorders), alopecia (spot baldness), diarrhea, nail toxicity, fatigue, dysgeusia (taste distortion), nausea, constipation, stomatitis (sore or inflammation inside the mouth), dry eye, dry mouth, decreased appetite, vomiting, joint pain, abdominal pain, back pain and dry skin. Ocular (eye) toxicity is also a risk of Pemazyre. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Pemazyre received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. As a condition of the accelerated approval, the sponsor will complete and submit the results of a randomized trial demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival as a postapproval requirement. The FDA granted approval of Pemazyre to Incyte Corporation.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Therapy for Children with Debilitating and Disfiguring Rare Disease", "date": "April 10, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Koselugo (selumetinib) for the treatment of pediatric patients, 2 years of age and older, with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing tumors to grow on nerves. Koselugo is the first drug approved by the FDA to treat this debilitating, progressive and often disfiguring rare disease that typically begins early in life. Koselugo is approved specifically for patients who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which are tumors involving the nerve sheaths (coating around nerve fibers) and can grow anywhere in the body, including the face, extremities, areas around the spine and deep in the body where they may affect organs. Koselugo is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it functions by blocking a key enzyme, which results in helping to stop the tumor cells from growing. NF1 is a rare, progressive condition caused by a mutation or flaw in a particular gene. NF1 is usually diagnosed in early childhood and appears in an estimated 1 out of every 3,000 infants. It is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), neurologic and skeletal impairments and risk for development of benign and malignant tumors throughout life. Between 30% and 50% of patients born with NF1 develop one or more PNs. The FDA approved Koselugo based on a clinical trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of pediatric patients who had NF1 and inoperable PN (defined as a PN that could not be completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity to the patient). The efficacy results were from 50 of the patients who received the recommended dose and had routine evaluations of changes in tumor size and tumor-related morbidities during the trial. Patients received Koselugo 25 mg/m2 orally twice a day until disease progression or until they experienced unacceptable adverse reactions. The clinical trial measured the overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response and those who experienced more than a 20% reduction in PN volume on MRI that was confirmed on a subsequent MRI within 3-6 months. The ORR was 66% and all patients had a partial response, meaning that no patients had complete disappearance of the tumor. Of these patients, 82% had a response lasting 12 months or longer. Other clinical outcomes for patients during Koselugo treatment including changes in PN-related disfigurement, symptoms and functional impairments. Although the sample sizes of patients assessed for each PN-related morbidity (such as disfigurement, pain, strength and mobility problems, airway compression, visual impairment and bladder or bowel dysfunction) were small, there appeared to be a trend of improvement in PN-related symptoms or functional deficits during treatment. Common side effects for patients taking Koselugo were vomiting, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dry skin, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain (pain in the body affecting bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons and nerves), fever, acneiform rash (acne), stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), headache, paronychia (infection in the skin that surrounds a toenail or fingernail) and pruritus (itching). Koselugo can also cause serious side effects including heart failure (manifested as ejection fraction decrease, or when the muscle of the left ventricle of the heart is not pumping as well as normal) and ocular toxicity (acute and chronic damage to the eye) including retinal vein occlusion, retinal pigment epithelial detachment and impaired vision. Patients should have cardiac and ophthalmic assessments performed prior to initiating Koselugo and at regular intervals during treatment. Koselugo can also cause increased creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). CPK is an enzyme found in the heart, brain and skeletal muscles. When muscle tissue is damaged, CPK leaks into a person’s blood. CPK elevation in a patient receiving Koselugo should prompt an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle due to direct or indirect muscle injury). Koselugo should be withheld, dosage reduced or dosage permanently discontinued based on the severity of adverse reactions. Further, Koselugo contains Vitamin E, and patients are at an increased risk of bleeding if their daily intake of Vitamin E exceeds the recommended or safe limits. Based on findings from animal studies, Koselugo may cause harm to a newborn baby when administered to a pregnant woman. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age, and males with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment with Koselugo, and for one week after the last dose. The FDA granted this application designation. Koselugo also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases, and Designation for the treatment of pediatric NF1. The application is awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher. The FDA granted approval of Koselugo to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP.

PPE shortages have the potential to significantly impact the quality, purity and availability of drugs that are compounded for patients, including those in critical need. The guidance discusses how pharmacies may be able to preserve PPE if supplies are limited. Further, as a temporary measure to address the public health emergency posed by COVID-19, the agency is providing limited regulatory flexibility for compounders that cannot obtain sufficient supplies of PPE for sterile compounding, provided they adopt risk mitigation strategies as described in the guidance. FDA adopted this policy to help assure patient access to needed medicines and to reduce the risks of compounding when standard PPE are not available.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Continues to Facilitate Access to Crucial Medical Products, Including Ventilators", "date": "March 22, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to help increase the availability of ventilators and accessories, as well as other respiratory devices, during the COVID-19 pandemic to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing. “The FDA’s new actions will mean America can make more ventilators during this crisis,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “Today’s actions are another step by the FDA and HHS to eliminate every possible barrier to the all-of-America approach that President Trump has called for. With this boost from the FDA, medical device makers can more easily make changes to existing products, such as changes to suppliers or materials, to help address current manufacturing limitations or supply shortages. Other manufacturers, such as auto makers, can more easily repurpose production lines to help increase supply. Hospitals and other health care providers can repurpose machines they have now to serve as ventilators. HHS and FDA’s message is clear: If you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way.” “The FDA is doing everything we can to support patients, health care professionals, hospitals, medical product manufacturers and the public during this pandemic. One of the most impactful steps we can take is to help with access and availability to life-saving medical treatments,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D. “Our policy issued today demonstrates our ability to react and adapt quickly during this pandemic and help very ill patients access the lifesaving ventilator support they need. To do that, we are providing maximum regulatory flexibility to facilitate an increase in ventilator inventory, while still providing crucial FDA oversight. We believe this action will immediately increase ventilator availability. We will continue to engage with both traditional medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers about ways we can facilitate a ramping up of production of these life-saving medical devices.” outlines several key steps. First, the guidance describes the agency’s intention to exercise enforcement discretion for certain modifications to these FDA-cleared devices. Normally, any time a manufacturer or user makes a modification to a ventilator device, for instance, adding wireless and/or Bluetooth capability for remote monitoring, those modifications can often trigger an FDA premarket review, which can delay the time it takes to get these devices to the bedside. The guidance also helps manufacturers ramp up their manufacturing by adding production lines or alternative sites, for instance, using non-medical device manufacturers such as automobile manufacturers, to start manufacturing ventilator parts. In recognition of the current pandemic situation, and to ease regulatory burden on manufacturers, the FDA is being flexible in not enforcing the premarket review requirement for these modifications. Second, as outlined in this guidance, hospitals and health care professionals may use ventilators intended for other environments. For example, the guidance notes hospitals that could repurpose ventilators normally used for transporting patients in an ambulance into the hospital setting for long-term use. The FDA also provides recommendations for other alternatives that should be considered such as devices for treating sleep apnea, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), devices. The FDA’s policy also applies to health care facilities that use ventilators beyond their indicated shelf life, which should increase ventilator capacity. Finally, the agency encourages manufacturers, whether foreign or domestic, to talk to FDA about pursuing an emergency use authorization (EUA), which would allow them to distribute their ventilators in the United States. This includes U.S.-based manufacturers that were previously engaged in making medical devices, but which have capabilities to increase supply of these devices. Taken altogether, these actions as outlined in the guidance demonstrates the FDA’s flexibility during this pandemic to help manufacturers and encourage increased production of ventilators. This guidance is one of many actions the FDA has taken to increase the availability of medical devices, including diagnostic supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). The FDA is responding to questions from diagnostic laboratories about the availability of certain testing supplies. We are updating in real time from labs and test developers, providing information on alternative sources of reagents, extraction kits, swabs and more. The toll-free line, 1-888-INFO-FDA, is in place to help laboratories with any questions they may have about the EUA process or getting supplies. The FDA has been working closely with PPE manufacturers to understand their supply capabilities during this pandemic. The agency is also aware of challenges throughout the supply chain that are presently impacting the availability of PPE products and is taking steps to mitigate shortages that health care facilities are already experiencing. For example, on March 2, the FDA to allow NIOSH-approved respirators typically used in industrial settings to be used in health care settings. The agency has also published a and FAQs that provide conservation strategies for gowns and masks and continues to coordinate and communicate with interagency and state partners to help ensure that they are more readily available. On Friday, the agency also issued a sharing conservation strategies for surgical gloves, recognizing the need for PPE, such as medical gloves, may outpace the supply available to health care organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed conservation strategies include using nonsterile disposable patient examination gloves for routine patient care or using medical gloves beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life in a setting where there is a lower risk of transmission.

Hemophilia A or B is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by a dysfunction or deficiency of Coagulation Factor (F) VIII or IX, respectively. People with hemophilia may bleed for a longer time than others after injury or surgery. They may also have spontaneous bleeding in muscles, joints and organs, which may be life-threatening. Individuals with inhibitors may not respond to factor replacement therapy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are an . Bleeding episodes in these individuals are managed by either on-demand treatment or prophylaxis using products containing FVIII or FIX. However, when inhibitors to FVIII or FIX develop in these individuals, treatment of bleeding episodes with FVIII or FIX products may no longer be effective. In these situations, the administration of products such as Sevenfact, which bypass the Factor VIII and Factor IX reactions, promotes clot formation and controls bleeding. The active ingredient of Sevenfact is a recombinant analog of human FVII, which is expressed in the mammary gland of genetically engineered rabbits and secreted into the rabbits’ milk. During purification and processing of the milk, FVII is converted into activated FVII (FVIIa). The recombinant DNA (rDNA) construct in the genetically engineered rabbits used for the production of Sevenfact was approved by the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. The safety and efficacy of Sevenfact were determined using data from a clinical study that evaluated 27 patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, which included treatment of 465 mild or moderate, and three severe bleeding episodes. The study assessed the efficacy of treatment 12 hours after the initial dose was given. The proportion of mild or moderate bleeding episodes treated successfully both with the lower dose of 75mcg/kg and higher dose of 225 mcg/kg (requiring no further treatment for the bleeding episode, no administration of blood products and no increase in pain beyond 12 hours from initial dose) was approximately 86%. The study also included three severe bleeding episodes that were treated successfully with the higher dose. Another study evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of three escalating doses of Sevenfact in 15 patients with severe hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. Results from this study were used to select the two doses, 75mcg/kg and 225 mcg/kg, that were evaluated in the study described above. The most common side effects of Sevenfact were headache, dizziness, infusion site discomfort, infusion related reaction, infusion site hematoma and fever. Sevenfact is contraindicated in patients with known allergy or hypersensitivity to rabbits or rabbit proteins. Patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors who have other risk factors for blood clots (thrombosis) may be at increased risk of serious arterial and venous thrombotic events. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible. Should symptoms of a thrombotic event or hypersensitivity reaction occur, patients should discontinue Sevenfact and seek appropriate medical intervention. The FDA granted approval of Sevenfact to Laboratoire Francais du Fractionnement et des Biotechnologies S.A. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

According to the , bronchospasms occur when the muscles surrounding the airways swell and tighten, causing them to squeeze the airways and make them smaller. Exercise and other physical activity can bring on symptoms in most people who have asthma and may occur either during or right after being active. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing), chest tightness, shortness of breath and coughing. The coughing often worsens at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 26 million people are known to have asthma, about 7 million of these people are children. The most common side effects associated with Albuterol Sulfate Metered Dose Inhaler, 90 mcg/Inhalation, are upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), tremor and nervousness. The FDA regularly takes steps to help guide industry through the development process for generic products, including complex combination products, such as metered dose inhalers, that consist of a drug and a device. The development of many generic combination products can be more challenging than solid oral dosage forms, like tablets. Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA), individual companies can meet with the FDA as part of its to support the development of such complex generic drug products. The FDA also publishes guidance documents describing the steps the FDA recommends companies take to submit complete applications for generic drug products. In March 2020, the FDA issued a revised for proposed generic albuterol sulfate metered dose inhalers, including drug products referencing Proventil HFA. Among other things, the draft guidance provides bioequivalence recommendations. The FDA requires applicants to submit appropriate data and information to demonstrate that complex generic drug-device combination products meet the agency’s rigorous approval standards. These standards ensure quality generic drug products are as safe and effective as their brand name counterparts.

The FDA has consumers not to purchase or drink chlorine dioxide products sold online as medical treatments, as the agency is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting their safety or effectiveness and they pose significant risks to patient health. The FDA is taking this action to protect Americans as part of its response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA issued a joint warning letter with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing for selling chlorine dioxide products that it fraudulently claims can treat or prevent COVID-19 in adults and children. This is especially concerning since children are a vulnerable population that may be at greater risk for adverse reactions from consuming chlorine dioxide. The FDA and FTC requested that the company respond in 48 hours describing the specific steps it has taken to correct the violations. Companies that sell products with unapproved claims to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 may be subject to enforcement action, including but not limited to seizure or injunction. Chlorine dioxide products have not been shown to be safe and effective for any use, including COVID-19, but these products continue to be sold as a remedy for treating autism, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and flu, among other conditions, despite their harmful effects. Websites selling chlorine dioxide products typically describe the product as a liquid that is 28% sodium chlorite in distilled water. Product directions instruct consumers to mix the sodium chlorite solution with citric acid – such as lemon or lime juice – or another acid – such as hydrochloric acid – before drinking. In many instances, the sodium chlorite is sold as part of a kit with a citric acid “activator.” When the acid is added, the mixture becomes chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent that has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. The FDA has received reports of people experiencing serious adverse events after drinking chlorine dioxide products, including: The FDA is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting the safety or effectiveness of “Miracle Mineral Solution” products, despite claims that the solution has antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial properties. The FDA encourages consumers to talk to a health care professional about preventing and treating medical conditions or diseases. The FDA is particularly concerned that products that fraudulently claim to cure, treat or prevent serious diseases like COVID-19 may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. In addition to following up with companies that fail to make adequate corrections, the FDA will continue to monitor social media, online marketplaces and incoming complaints to help ensure that the companies do not continue to sell fraudulent products under a different company name or on another website. The FDA is closely monitoring for fraudulent products related to COVID-19 and has issued a number of since the start of the pandemic. The FDA reminds consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, mitigate, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. Fraudulent COVID-19 products may come in many varieties, including dietary supplements and other foods, as well as products purporting to be drugs, medical devices or vaccines. Products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat, diagnose or prevent disease, but are not proven safe and effective for those purposes, defraud consumers of money and can place consumers at risk for serious harm. Using these products may lead to delays in getting proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other potentially serious diseases and conditions.

These changes are based on recently completed studies and epidemiological data, leading the FDA to conclude that the polices could be modified without compromising the safety of the blood supply. The changes being announced to three guidances (HIV, malaria and CJD/vCJD) are for immediate implementation, and are expected to remain in place after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, with any appropriate changes based on comments we receive and our experience implementing the guidances. Additionally, the FDA is publishing a fourth guidance providing notice of alternatives to certain requirements regarding blood donor eligibility for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The guidances are available Food update to date: the FDA a public service announcement on food safety and the food supply. Consumers should rest assured that the FDA is on the job and working tirelessly to keep the American food supply among the safest in the world. The agency still reports no widespread food shortages or food safety issues. Today, the FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to three companies for selling fraudulent COVID-19 products, as part of the agency’s effort to protect consumers. With these warning letters, the FDA is exercising its authority to protect consumers from companies selling unapproved products and making false or misleading claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diagnostics update to date: A new FDA Voices was issued: . Almost 400 FDA Commissioned Corps officers have been deployed to aid in response to the pandemic. Among HHS agencies, the FDA is privileged to have the second highest number of Commissioned Corps officers serving in our ranks—more than 1,100 officers in total. This allows us to truly be on call 24/7 to protect America’s food supply and essential medicines, and to ensure the safety of life-saving medical devices, vaccines and the blood supply during this pandemic. FDA’s U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps officers are highly-trained public health professionals who work nationally and internationally in careers such as medicine, veterinary sciences, dentistry, nursing, epidemiology and biomedical research to serve underserved and vulnerable communities. One of the companies , Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials LLC., sells unapproved and misbranded colloidal silver products with misleading claims the products can build immunity for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Another company , Homeomart Indibuy, offers homeopathic drug products for sale in the U.S. that are unapproved and misbranded with misleading claims the products are safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The third company , Health Mastery Systems DBA Pure Plant Essentials, sells essential oils with misleading claims that the products are safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

As part of the response to this pandemic, the agency is taking the lead on a national effort to facilitate the development of, and access to, two investigational therapies derived from human blood. These are called convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin and are antibody-rich blood products made from blood donated by people who have recovered from the virus. The products can be administered to individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. There are some limited data to suggest that convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin may have benefit in the COVID-19 illness. This is why evaluation of these therapies in the context of a clinical trial and expanded access program is so important. “Under President Trump’s leadership, the FDA is launching a new national effort to bring blood-related therapies for COVID-19 to market as fast as possible,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “The President’s all-of-America approach has driven unprecedented cooperation between the public and private sector, with the FDA finding new ways for the private sector to bring their products to patients while gathering the data we need on efficacy. Thanks to the hard work of FDA staff, scientists and physicians elsewhere, and support from NIH and BARDA, patients will be able to benefit from these promising new options in the coming weeks.” “This is an important area of research — the use of products made from a recovered patient’s blood to potentially treat COVID-19 in those affected by this illness. The FDA remains actively engaged with partners across the U.S. government, academia and industry to expedite the development and availability of critical medical products to prevent and treat this novel virus – both evaluating the safety and efficacy of potential therapies and facilitating emergency access for patients, as appropriate,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The FDA had played a key role in organizing a partnership between industry, academic institutions, and government agencies to facilitate expanded access to convalescent plasma. This is certainly a great example of how we can all come together to take swift action to help the American people during a crisis.” that have emerged from China, these products have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19. The FDA is facilitating access to convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 using multiple pathways. The agency’s initial effort was focused on facilitating access to convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 disease through an emergency investigational new drug application (eIND) process. The FDA has to help health care providers submit these applications to treat individual patients. The agency also is facilitating the conduct of well-controlled clinical trials at academic institutions to rigorously evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma. Notably, the FDA has led an effort, working collaboratively with our industry, academic, and government partners to develop and implement a protocol that will provide convalescent plasma to patients in need across the country who may not have access to institutions with clinical trials in place. This will allow for a simplified process for providers that will help to ensure patient safety, while also allowing for the collection of needed information about product efficacy. In this partnership, the will serve as the lead institution for the program and the American Red Cross will help collect plasma and distribute it for use in patients across the country. The program was developed with funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response. The FDA anticipates that this collaborative effort will be able to move thousands of units of plasma to the patients who need them in the coming weeks. The agency is also working with industry and its government partners to accelerate the development and availability of hyperimmune globulin for investigation for the potential treatment COVID-19. Hyperimmune globulin is a biological product manufactured from convalescent plasma. The FDA is helping to coordinate a study of hyperimmune globulin that will be conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, as well as coordinating other efforts in this area. The FDA continues to provide advice, guidance, and technical assistance to help expedite the development of these products and intends to use regulatory flexibility in making these products and other critical medical countermeasures available to prevent and treat COVID-19. People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma, which could potentially help save the lives of up to four patients. Those willing to donate are urged to visit the American Red Cross website at or contact their local blood donor or plasma collection center.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Serological Tests", "date": "April 07, 2020", "contents": " Serological tests measure the amount of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection, like COVID-19. In other words, the test detects the body’s immune response to the infection caused by the virus rather than detecting the virus itself. In the early days of an infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the test’s effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19. Serological tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19 by helping healthcare professionals to identify individuals who have overcome an infection in the past and have developed an immune response. In the future, this may potentially be used to help determine, together with other clinical data, that such individuals are no longer susceptible to infection and can return to work. In addition, these test results can aid in determining who may donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma, which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19. This is why Vice President Mike Pence called on the laboratory community to develop serological tests for COVID-19. In March, the FDA issued a policy to allow developers of certain serological tests to begin to market or use their tests once they have performed the appropriate evaluation to determine that their tests are accurate and reliable. This includes allowing developers to market their tests without prior FDA review if certain conditions outlined in the guidance document are met. The FDA issued this policy to allow early patient access to certain serological tests with the understanding that the FDA has not reviewed and authorized them. The FDA can also authorize tests for COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). To date, FDA has for a serological test that is intended for use by clinical laboratories. Since the FDA issued the policy, over 70 test developers have notified the agency that they have serological tests available for use.

Epclusa in combination with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 6 years and older or weighing at least 37 pounds with severe cirrhosis. The FDA previously approved Epclusa to treat HCV in adults. HCV is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016 there were an estimated in the United States with chronic HCV, and children born to HCV-positive mothers are at risk for HCV infection. The pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes and rids itself of a drug), safety and efficacy of Epclusa, taken orally for 12 weeks, for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 infection was established in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial that included a total of 173 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced pediatric patients ages 6 years and older without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis. No meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics were seen in pediatric patients compared to adults. The safety and efficacy results were comparable to those observed in adults. In 102 patients ages 12 through17, 93% of patients with genotype 1 and 100% of patients with genotypes 2, 3, 4 and 6 had no detectable virus in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infection was cured. Among the 71 patients ages 6 to 11 years with HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4, 93% with genotype 1, 91% with genotype 3 and 100% with genotypes 2 and genotype 4 had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for treatment of HCV genotype 5 in pediatric patients 6 years and older or weighing at least 37 pounds without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis are supported by sofosbuvir and velpatasvir exposures in adults and pediatric patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 infection. Similar data were used to support dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection who have severe cirrhosis. The safety and effectiveness of Epclusa have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age. The most common adverse reactions observed with treatment with Epclusa were fatigue and headache. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of Epclusa in adults. Epclusa includes a boxed warning that hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in patients infected with both HCV and HBV who were taking or had completed treatment with HCV antivirals and were not taking HBV antivirals. HBV reactivation has resulted in hepatitis that occurs suddenly and escalates quickly (fulminant), kidney failure and death. Health care providers should test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before initiation of Epclusa and continue to monitor patients throughout the treatment. The FDA granted Priority Review of Epclusa to Gilead Sciences Inc.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Blood Donations", "date": "March 19, 2020", "contents": " The nation’s blood supply requires a steady supply of donors who generously donate millions of units of potentially life-saving blood and blood components each year. Every two seconds, a patient needs a blood transfusion. At this time the number of blood donations has been dramatically reduced due to the implementation of social distancing and the cancellation of blood drives. We fully support President Trump’s , which includes recommendations to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and the need to practice good hygiene, like hand washing. We also recognize that maintaining adequate levels of our nation’s blood supply is critical. People who donate blood are equivalent to those people who are working in a critical infrastructure industry. In volunteering to do so, they are contributing immeasurably to the public health of our nation. In order to ensure that blood is available to those who need it most, it is important for healthy individuals who are able to donate to take the time to do so. Blood donation centers can facilitate the safe donation of blood because they are skilled in infection control practices and already have procedures in place to prevent the spread of infections. Blood donation centers always take steps to prevent staff and donors who are not feeling well or who have a fever from reaching the donor area, and they are now taking additional social distancing precautions wherever possible, consistent with the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America. Donating blood is safe and takes only a little of your time. At many blood donation centers, those who are interested in donating can make an appointment to minimize the time it takes to donate blood. Centers can arrange to call a donor’s mobile phone when they’re ready for the donor to come in.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Focuses on Safety of Regulated Products While Scaling Back Domestic Inspections", "date": "March 18, 2020", "contents": " Protecting the health and safety of our staff and their families is of paramount concern to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a nation we must do everything we can to help slow the spread of the virus and help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now more than ever, the American people are depending on us. We must ensure our workforce remains healthy to carry out the FDA’s critical public health mission to keep Americans safe. In keeping with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and cross-government guidance, this week we directed all eligible FDA employees to begin teleworking. While this does not apply to those carrying out non-portable activities, such as certain lab activities or the monitoring of imported products, we will continue to adjust our approach to a number of activities, including facility inspections for all FDA-regulated products such as food, animal feed, drugs, biological products, devices and tobacco. Earlier this month, we that we are postponing most foreign facility inspections through April and that inspections outside the U.S. deemed mission-critical will be considered on a case-by-case basis as this outbreak continues to unfold. Today, we’re announcing that for the health and well-being of our staff and those who conduct inspections for the agency under contract at the state level, and because of industry concerns about visitors, we have temporarily postponed all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. These are facility inspections the FDA traditionally conducts every few years based on a risk analysis. Importantly, all domestic for-cause inspection assignments will be evaluated and will proceed if mission-critical. We will continue to respond to natural disasters, outbreaks and other public health emergencies involving FDA-regulated products. I want to assure the American public that we have full confidence in the safety and quality of the products we all use every day and that the FDA will continue to leverage all available authorities to continue to ensure the integrity of the products we regulate. Importantly, during this interim period we’re evaluating additional ways to conduct our inspectional work that would not jeopardize public safety and protecting both the firms and the FDA staff. This can include, among other things, evaluating records in lieu of conducting an onsite inspection on an interim basis when travel is not permissible, when appropriate. In fact, inspections are just one part of a robust and multi-pronged approach to overseeing the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products, however inspections are not what cause quality to happen. Safety and quality need to be owned by the industry and firms have the primary responsibility to reliably produce quality products. For example, the medical product and food industries we regulate are subject to certain reporting requirements about their facilities and also must adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements pertaining to, for example, operating procedures, manufacturing, sanitation, and processing controls, as well as preventive controls to reduce or eliminate food safety hazards. From our experience across the agency, we also believe FDA-regulated firms understand and appreciate their shared responsibility to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and we will continue to communicate with them during this time to underscore this partnership. In fact, in last fiscal year, the overall domestic violation rate was only about 5%. The FDA remains committed to using all available tools to oversee the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products for American patients and consumers. As this remains a dynamic situation, we will continue to assess and calibrate our approach as needed and we stand ready to resume any postponed inspections as soon as feasible. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Continues to Facilitate Development of Treatments", "date": "March 19, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to play a critical role in the multifaceted all-of-government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes, among other things, facilitating medical countermeasures to treat and prevent the disease, and surveilling the medical product and food supply chains for potential shortages or disruptions and helping to mitigate such impacts, as necessary. As part of those efforts, President Trump has directed the FDA to continue its work with the public and private sector to ensure the availability of potentially safe and effective life-saving drugs to patients who are in desperate need, including those infected with COVID-19. The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19. “President Trump’s aggressive response and bold actions to keep Americans safe from COVID-19 bought us precious time to advance therapeutics and other necessary tools,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Today’s actions show that HHS and the United States are leading the world in these efforts. Disseminating information about promising off-label uses of drugs we already have, investigating their effectiveness, and pursuing other therapeutics will help give American healthcare providers the tools they need to save lives. As we have always seen when America has faced a serious threat, American industry, academic institutions and government are coming together to deliver us what we need to win.” The FDA wants to assure the American public that the agency continues to work with partners across the U.S. government and regulated industry to expedite the development and availability of critical medical products to prevent and treat this novel virus, including repurposing existing therapies that may help treat patients with COVID-19. “As is true for most medical situations, the great American innovators in academia and industry have engaged with us about treatment options. We are extremely encouraged by the interest and promise in the development of the COVID-19-related therapies. We understand and recognize the urgency with which we are all seeking prevention and treatment options for COVID-19. FDA staff are working expeditiously on that front” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D. “We also must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other, more appropriate, treatments. At the same time, we will engage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures. If clinical data suggests this product may be promising in treating COVID-19, we know there will be increased demand for it. We will take all steps to ensure chloroquine remains available for patients who take it to treat severe and life-threatening illnesses such as lupus.” While there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19, there are several FDA-approved treatments that may help ease the symptoms from a supportive care perspective. The FDA is working closely with innovators in their work to expedite these efforts, including leveraging scientific information about the virus and trials currently being conducted in other countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Italy as well as in the U.S. Quickly after the emergence of this virus, the FDA began working directly with partners and innovators to foster the development of medical countermeasures against COVID-19, and we are continuing to provide regulatory flexibility, advice, guidance, and technical assistance. The FDA continues to work with interested sponsors to help expedite any additional clinical trials for COVID-19 medical countermeasures that may be appropriate. The FDA is able to, and has been, turning around requests very quickly to assist in initiating clinical trials. For example, last month, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began a for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. The FDA has been working with the drug sponsor, , to find multiple pathways to both study the drug under the FDA’s investigational new drug requirements, and thus collect helpful data about the efficacy of the drug, as well as provide the drug to patients under emergency use. The FDA is committed to continuing to make use of its expanded access program to allow the emergency use of this product for those patients, when appropriate. To date, the agency has already granted about 250 patients access to this product. The data collected from the expanded access program may contribute to the agency’s understanding of the drug, but controlled clinical trials are needed to determine if it safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. The FDA’s efforts to facilitate the development of these therapies are squarely focused on ensuring these medical countermeasures meet the agency’s world-respected gold standard, relying on data from adequate and well-controlled trials to most efficiently determine if an experimental treatment can safely and effectively benefit patients. Innovators are looking at products in a variety of areas, including the assessment of antiviral drugs that might treat the specific virus, as well as host targets, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors that may be helpful in reducing lung inflammation and improving lung function in COVID-19 patients, thereby potentially slowing the progression of severe respiratory symptoms. has announced the initiation of a randomized controlled clinical trial of sarilumab, an antibody to the IL-6 receptor, to assess whether the modification of the inflammatory response by this treatment provides benefit to COVID-19 patients. There’s also interest in evaluating whether therapies, such as convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin, antibody-rich blood products that are taken from blood donated by people who have recovered from the virus, could shorten the length, or lessen the severity, of the illness. The FDA is taking the lead on an urgent cross-government approach to facilitate the development of all of these products. Facilitating the ultimate widespread use and availability of safe and effective medical countermeasures is critical for a number of reasons, including that reducing the severity and duration of respiratory or other symptoms through medical treatments could help lessen the burden on medical personnel, equipment, and facilities. At the same time, the FDA will continue work to facilitate the development of treatment options in the near-term, the agency is also working with interagency partners, product developers, and international public health organizations to expedite the development of vaccines to the greatest extent possible. In fact, earlier this week, NIH the start of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Seattle in 45 healthy adult volunteers to test the safety of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against COVID-19 infection. The FDA intends to use all of the regulatory flexibility granted to it by Congress to ensure the most efficient and timely development of vaccines to fight COVID-19. As agency staff work around the clock to facilitate prevention and treatment options, it’s extremely important for everyone to know that people may try to make claims about products that are not approved - and don’t have data supporting efficacy - in preventing, treating or diagnosing COVID-19. The FDA is closely monitoring the market to combat these products with fraudulent claims. It is unacceptable that anyone would take advantage of Americans during this public health crisis, and the FDA wants to make sure everyone knows what legitimate products are being developed. The FDA remains steadfast in helping to foster the development of safe and effective medical countermeasures and ensuring they are available as quickly as possible to protect public health and safeguarding Americans from fraudulent products claiming to prevent, treat, or diagnose COVID-19 as part of the agency’s around-the-clock response to this outbreak. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

These guidance documents will be in effect for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020. Because of an increased demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been reports of some consumers attempting to make hand sanitizers for personal use. The agency lacks information on the methods being used to prepare such products and whether they are safe for use on human skin. The guidance , is immediately in effect and outlines that the agency does not intend to take action against manufacturing firms that prepare alcohol-based hand sanitizers for consumer use and for use as health care personnel hand rubs during this ongoing public health emergency as described in the guidance . The second guidance, , is in effect for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities. Compounding is generally a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or, in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a tailor-made medication. The temporary policy outlined by the agency does not require compounders to obtain a patient-specific prescription. The FDA’s guidance documents apply only to handrub products prepared using the United States Pharmacopoeia or Food Chemical Codex grade ingredients specifically described in the guidance, consistent with World Health Organization recommendations. The guidance documents also discuss product labeling and certain manufacturing methods and reporting requirements, such as that manufacturers must have a way to accept and submit adverse event reports to FDA for any products they manufacture. The agency realizes that manufacturers and compounders will need time to ramp up production as they obtain the ingredients needed to make these hand sanitizers. During this time the FDA will work to assist them as they develop hand sanitizers to make available for the American public.

As a result of these activities, the agency is beginning to see unauthorized fraudulent test kits that are being marketed to test for COVID-19 in the home. We want to alert the American public that, at this time, the FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers in this space. Fraudulent health claims, tests, and products can pose serious health risks. They may keep some patients from seeking care or delay necessary medical treatment. The FDA reminds consumers to follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s and speak to your medical provider if you have symptoms of COVID-19. Your medical provider will advise you about whether you should get tested and the process for being tested with an appropriate test. The FDA will take appropriate action to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public by marketing tests that pose risks to patient health. This may include issuing warning letters, seizures or injunctions. We have already identified and to companies found selling and promoting fraudulent items, and we expect additional such actions will be forthcoming. Additionally, we are stepping up enforcement at ports of entry, including International Mail Facilities, to ensure these fraudulent products that originate outside the country do not enter through our borders.

The agency is continuously examining the global supply chain to identify any concerns and assess the availability of the products Americans need most. We are also partnering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on supply chain issues, including importation of needed medical products to support the U.S. response. Here is a status update and details on some of the latest actions we have taken: As a doctor, the situation with personal protective equipment (PPE) is very concerning. We are taking every possible action we can, but we know the situation is dire for many health care facilities. We want to share that the FDA, along with the private sector, FEMA and all of the U.S. Government, are working around the clock to address this issue as quickly as possible. We are aware of shortages of respirators and have issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) covering certain respirators to enable them to be used in health care settings. Via the EUA and the shortages mailbox, the team has directed stakeholders to CDC’s strategies for Most recently, the FDA issued an EUA to help increase the supply of filtering facepiece respirators by authorizing the use of certain imported disposable respirators that are not National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved for use by health care professionals. We are continuing to work on strategies to increase the availability of these devices. We are also working on mitigation strategies for other types of personal protective equipment including surgical masks, gowns, and gloves. We have issued information to health care providers and have provided recommended conservation strategies for these important PPE. We are working with textile manufacturers, including clothing designers, about how we can repurpose their manufacturing product lines to put them to use to make masks. These masks can be used for surgical or other isolation procedures, as the benefits of using them outweigh the risks under current circumstances. We are providing maximum regulatory flexibility where we can. We are also open to importing PPE and other devices and have provided . The agency is taking steps to facilitate importation of PPE into the U.S. and we are ready and available to engage with importers to minimize disruptions during the importing process. This means that when products come in from overseas, their authorization via our EUA authority allows them to quickly enter the country. These products aren’t hindered from entry and we’ve already determined, among other criteria, that the known and potential benefits of these products being used in health care settings outweigh the known and potential risks. The FDA has reached out to more than 1,000 device manufacturing sites worldwide, focusing on essential devices.  The outreach thus far has focused on two main types of essential devices: those that are in high demand due to the pandemic outbreak, such as PPE and ventilators, and devices that may be prone to potential shortage if there is a supply disruption. We further recognize the need for ventilators, ventilator accessories, and other respiratory devices may outpace the supply available to health care facilities. We have issued an immediately in effect guidance outlining a policy intended to help increase availability of ventilators and their accessories as well as other respiratory devices. In addition to the guidance, the FDA has issued an that authorizes the emergency use of ventilators, anesthesia gas machines modified for use as ventilators, and positive pressure breathing devices modified for use as ventilators (collectively referred to as “ventilators”), ventilator tubing connectors, and ventilator accessories, that FDA determines meet the specified criteria for safety, performance and labeling. We anticipate this action will increase the number of patients who can have access to ventilators or similar machines for respiratory distress, which is important for critically ill COVID-19 patients As with prior emergencies, the FDA has taken proactive steps to establish and remain in contact with medical device manufacturers and others in the supply chain, including hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The agency also encourages manufacturers and healthcare facilities to report any supply disruptions to the device shortages mailbox, . This mailbox is closely monitored and has proven to be a valuable surveillance resource to augment FDA efforts to detect and mitigate potential supply chain disruption. We continue to work closely with manufacturers to make sure that they continue to notify the FDA, as early as possible, of a permanent discontinuance or any interruption in manufacturing that is likely to lead to a disruption in supply. This communication and the full cooperation of companies providing specific and necessary information is imperative in order for us to have an accurate understanding of the supply landscape and work to take proactive steps to mitigate shortages. To help human drug manufacturers submit timely and informative notifications, the agency is publishing a for immediate implementation about the importance of these notifications, the timelines for manufacturers to follow when notifying the FDA, and the details for them to provide about the discontinuance or interruption of manufacturing. We recognize that while some supply disruptions and shortages cannot be predicted or prevented, early communication and detailed notifications from manufacturers to the agency play a significant role in decreasing their incidence, impact, and duration. Our efforts with federal partners and pharmacy groups continue to establish mitigation strategies and prevent long-term supply shortages. At this time, where there is an acute demand for certain products and disruption in the supply chain, we are taking proactive steps to make sure that patients can access the medications that are medically appropriate and necessary. Some retail pharmacies have begun implementing policies designed to limit the overprescribing and overdispensing of certain medications in order to preserve the supply nationally. We are also aware that a number of states have taken action to limit the dispensing of certain drugs, including chloroquine and hydroxychlorquine. Our public drug shortages lists are up-to-date with that we have determined to be in shortage. These shortages are not all results of COVID-19, with many existing prior to the pandemic as results of market changes and supply challenges. We are updating these lists regularly and communicating in real-time so that patients and healthcare providers have the most current information on product shortages in the U.S. The agency has decided it does not intend to object to using hydroxychloroquine. Despite this action, it is important to note that there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19; however, there are FDA-approved treatments that may help ease the symptoms of COVID-19. Lastly, we appreciate industry’s willingness to help supply hand sanitizer to the market to meet the increasing demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As part of our commitment to providing timely guidance to support continuity and response efforts during this pandemic, the agency has published guidances to provide flexibility to help meet the demand for hand sanitizer. Blood supplies have been dramatically reduced due to the implementation of social distancing and the cancellation of blood drives.  Maintaining adequate levels of our nation’s blood supply is critical.  People who donate blood are equivalent to those who work in .  We continue to encourage individuals who are healthy and able to donate blood.  Donating is safe and takes only a little of your time.  At many blood donations centers, those who are interested in donating can make an appointment to minimize the time it takes to donate blood.  Contact information for local blood collection sites and for scheduling appointments can be found Overall, retail supply chains remain strong, and we are working with food manufacturers and grocery stores to closely monitor the human and animal food supply chain for any shortages. The agency is in close contact with industry and its trade associations, which are in touch with their members about supply chain issues. Food production and manufacturing – for both people and animals – are dispersed throughout the U.S., and we are pleased to report there are currently no widespread disruptions reported in the supply chain. Empty grocery shelves are largely due to unprecedented demand – not a lack of capacity to produce, process and deliver.  Manufacturers and retailers are working around the clock to replenish shelves. The same is true for animal food. The FDA is monitoring the availability of foods for livestock and pets. There are no shortages, and no current disruptions in the pet and livestock food supply chain. I am grateful to workers in the food and agriculture sector filling critical and essential roles within communities. Their ability to continue to work during periods of community restrictions, social distancing, and closure orders, among others, is crucial to community continuity and community resilience. This was reinforced by Our Center for Veterinary Medicine is working with veterinary stakeholder groups to alert veterinary professionals to adopt PPE conservation strategies to make the most of their current supply of items, such as masks and gloves. We’re also encouraging the postponement of non-urgent/routine veterinary medical procedures during this pandemic.

FDA and FTC issued warning letters to two companies for selling unapproved products claiming to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. One of the companies, , was warned for selling the product Coronavirus Infection Prevention Nasal Spray with misleading claims on its website that its product is safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The agencies also warned for selling its herbal products, including “Carahealth Immune,” with misleading claims of prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. We are particularly concerned that unapproved drugs that claim to cure, treat, or prevent serious conditions may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious or life-threatening harm. There is currently no approved treatment or preventative measure for COVID-19. FDA and FTC are closely monitoring social media, the online marketplace, and incoming reports for fraudulent COVID-19 products on the market. The FDA issued an updated guidance, “ ,” with an appendix adding questions and answers on this subject. We plan to update this appendix as new questions arise. This guidance is intended for industry, investigators and institutional review boards and was issued because we recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical trials of medical products, including drugs, devices and biological products. Diagnostics update to date: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 230 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for tests that detect the virus. To date, 20 have been issued for diagnostic tests, including Abbott Diagnostics Scarborough, Inc., ID NOW COVID-19, a rapid (13 minutes or less) test. Additionally, the FDA has been notified that more than 110 laboratories have begun testing under the policies set forth in our COVID-19 Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency Guidance. The FDA also continues to keep its up to date."},
{"title": "FDA on Signing of the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Bill, Including Landmark Over-the-Counter Drug Reform and User Fee Legislation", "date": "March 30, 2020", "contents": " On Friday, the President signed into law a $2 trillion emergency relief bill that will continue to aid the response efforts and ease the economic impact of COVID-19. The legislation will help all of us at the FDA deliver support and guidance to protect and promote public health during this unprecedented pandemic. Specifcially, the legislation provided an additional $80 million in funding to continue the Agency’s COVID-19 response efforts, including the development of medical countermeasures and vaccines, promoting the advanced manufacturing of medical products and monitoring of the medical product supply chain. The FDA thanks Congress for its continued support of these crucial efforts and looks forward to continuing to work with members of Congress on all legislative efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on public health. Addtionally, we want to specifically highlight the portion of the bill that reforms and modernizes the way certain over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are regulated in the United States – a landmark step that will have an impact lasting long after the current public health emergency. The law grants the FDA transformative, new authorities that will meaningfully advance our efforts to modernize the OTC drug development and review process to help advance innovative, safe and effective options for consumers and secure a robust OTC marketplace. The FDA is committed to using these new tools to promote innovation and improve the safety and effectiveness of OTC monograph drugs – including products like hand sanitizers and acetaminophen, which are so critical to the public health emergency we face right now. We look forward to providing updates as we implement this important new law. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA expedites review of diagnostic tests to combat COVID-19", "date": "March 30, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been providing unprecedented flexibility to labs and manufacturers to develop and offer COVID-19 tests across the U.S. The FDA’s regulations have not hindered or been a roadblock to the rollout of tests during this pandemic. Every action the FDA has taken during this public health emergency to address the COVID-19 pandemic has balanced the urgent need to make diagnostic tests available with providing a level of oversight that ensures accurate tests are being deployed. Moreover, as in previous emergencies, the FDA has been extremely proactive and supportive of test development by all comers—laboratories, and large and small commercial manufacturers—offering our expertise and support to speed development and to quickly authorize tests that the science supports. It is not the FDA’s role to develop tests or decide what tests a health care professional uses. Our role is to determine if the tests developed by others provide accurate and reliable results, even when some would prefer that we let tests on the market without evidence that they work. It’s critical that the tests used work. False results can also contribute to the spread of COVID-19. We want our treatments to be tested for effectiveness and reviewed by the FDA. We want the same for our tests—assurances that they are accurate and effective. Developing a test: Timeline of FDA support for test developers: Emergency Use Authorization authorities: FDA policy updates: The FDA has and will continue to play a pivotal role in this emergency response. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Typically, with an emerging health threat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the first developer of a diagnostic test in the U.S. - Samples of the virus are crucial to confirming the accuracy of the test. CDC has first access to viral samples that other test developers do not. CDC also manufactures their own tests for distribution to their national network of public health labs. In this pandemic, CDC encountered problems manufacturing their test. FDA assisted CDC in their work to resolve the issue and utilize a commercial manufacturer to make tests for any laboratory, not only public health labs. Viral samples became commercially available to private sector test developers in later February, when the National Institutes of Health’s partner BEI Resources began selling vials of the virus grown from material provided by CDC. Laboratories have always had the ability to develop their own tests in the U.S.; the COVID-19 outbreak did not change this. Once a developer has a viral sample, they can confirm the accuracy of their test very quickly, usually in two to three days. In the future, making viral samples available earlier to commercial developers will be crucial to deploying tests quickly. Moreover, CDC’s test should be manufactured by a commercial entity with the requisite expertise. Since the beginning of January, the FDA has worked with more than 230 test developers who have or are expected to submit requests for FDA emergency authorization of their tests; to date, 20 authorizations have been granted. In addition, more than 110 laboratories have notified the FDA that they have begun using their own tests. For interested developers, the FDA provided recommendations for how to check a test for accuracy as well as a short form to make it easy to share their test information quickly in support of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). An EUA, put into place by Congress, is a relaxed standard that allows tests to be made available based on less data than in non-urgent circumstances and allows for expedited FDA review. In many cases, the FDA can do this review in as little as a day, which it has done repeatedly. EUA authority is not a barrier to test availability. The FDA recognized the urgent need for even faster testing availability. Although laboratories could use the EUA pathway, many were hesitant or didn’t know the pathway was available to them. To respond to this need, the FDA revised the process to allow labs to begin testing prior to FDA review of their validation data. This policy change was an unprecedented action to expand access to testing. Nevertheless, in the first week, only six laboratories took advantage of this further streamlined process because many laboratories did not have a test, or did not have the viral samples to check the accuracy of their test. In addition, the FDA implemented another change to empower states to take responsibility for tests developed and used by laboratories in their states without FDA review."},

The program, known as the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP), is using every tool at the agency’s disposal to bring new therapies to sick patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether these medical countermeasures are safe and effective for treating patients infected with this novel virus. “The FDA is announcing a new, comprehensive public-private approach to bring coronavirus treatments to market as fast as possible,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “As part of this new program, the FDA is cutting red tape, redeploying staff and working day and night to review requests from companies, scientists and doctors who are working toward therapies. We are grateful to the men and women of the FDA who have been working in concert with industry and other parts of HHS to support potential coronavirus treatments for weeks now. Each day, President Trump’s all-of-America approach is making progress and providing new hope in our fight against the coronavirus.” There are a large number of companies and researchers developing and evaluating COVID-19 related therapies. Given the urgent nature of the pandemic, under the FDA’s accelerator program, staff from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research are providing regulatory advice, guidance and technical assistance as quickly as possible. As part of this work, the FDA is triaging requests from developers and scientists seeking to develop new drug and biologic therapies, getting the relevant FDA staff in touch with them and providing rapid, interactive input to get studies underway quickly. For example, the FDA has reviewed study protocols within 24 hours in many cases and has reviewed single-patient expanded access requests generally within three hours. The FDA is also collaborating with federal partners, developers and researchers to create protocols that can be used across institutions and programs to streamline efforts. “Quickly after the emergence of this virus, we began working directly with federal health partners, academia and industry to advance medical countermeasures against COVID-19. Our staff continues to work across all sectors to expedite the development of numerous, innovative potential prevention and treatment approaches. We are also looking at pragmatic and expedited ways to make these products available to patients, while still ensuring the FDA’s standards are met,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn. “Accelerating the investigation of products that could potentially benefit people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the FDA’s highest priorities. We want to help patients by expediting promising treatments and are committed to maximizing our regulatory flexibility and proactively bringing the best innovators together to ensure we are getting the right treatments to the right patients at the right time.” To support these goals, the FDA has, among other things, redeployed medical and regulatory staff to serve on review teams dedicated to COVID-19 therapies, streamlined processes and operations for developers and scientists to send inquiries and requests and provided resources to health care providers and researchers to help them submit emergency requests to use investigational products. There are a variety of therapeutic areas being evaluated, including antiviral drugs like remdesivir that might treat the specific virus, as well as host targets, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors that may be helpful in reducing lung inflammation and improving lung function in COVID-19 patients. There’s also interest in examining whether therapies such as convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin, antibody-rich blood products that are taken from blood donated by people who have recovered from the virus, could shorten the length or lessen the severity of the illness. Work is also ongoing to evaluate whether existing therapies such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (with or without other medications) help treat patients with COVID-19. The FDA also recognizes the potential for many different real-world data sources to complement traditional clinical studies and speed the process of evaluating the impact of potential COVID-19 therapies. To that end, the agency is advancing relationships with partners in the public and private sectors to rapidly collect and analyze information in areas such as illness patterns and treatment outcomes. The FDA’s efforts to facilitate the development of COVID-19 therapies are focused on expediting the development of data on these medical countermeasures that can meet the agency’s world-respected gold standard for full FDA approval, which relies on data from adequate and well-controlled trials to most efficiently determine if an experimental treatment can safely and effectively benefit patients. The FDA will continue to enhance and expand its work across the federal government and innovators in academia and industry to accelerate COVID-19 treatments and other medical countermeasures. The agency will outline additional information in the near future to provide a greater understanding of the full breadth of work in this area, to the extent permitted by confidentiality laws.

Today, the FDA posted information regarding shortages of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to its due to a significant surge in demand. The agency is working with manufacturers to assess their supplies and is actively evaluating market demand for patients dependent on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. All manufacturers are ramping up production, and the agency’s webpage displays current availability. The FDA is working with manufacturers to ensure this can happen expeditiously and safely. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has also 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to the national stockpile and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials. Use of the donated medications is expected to help ease supply pressures for the drugs. This is a fluctuating and dynamic situation and the FDA is actively engaged. The agency is updating its shortages lists regularly and continuing to communicate in real-time so that patients and healthcare providers have the most current information on product shortages in the U.S. Today, the FDA and FTC issued warning letters to three companies for selling fraudulent products with claims to prevent, treat, mitigate, diagnose or cure COVID-19. One of the companies , Halosense Inc., sells salt therapy products with misleading claims that the products are safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Another company , Bioactive C60/FullerLifeC60 LLC, sells an unapproved and unauthorized product, “FullerLifeC60,” with misleading claims that it can build up immunity to help treat or prevent COVID-19 in people.

{"title": "FDA Requests Removal of All Ranitidine Products (Zantac) from the Market ", "date": "April 01, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced it is requesting manufacturers withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ranitidine drugs from the market immediately. This is the latest step in an ongoing of a contaminant known as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in ranitidine medications (commonly known by the brand name Zantac). The agency has determined that the impurity in some ranitidine products increases over time and when stored at higher than room temperatures and may result in consumer exposure to unacceptable levels of this impurity. As a result of this immediate market withdrawal request, ranitidine products will not be available for new or existing prescriptions or OTC use in the U.S. NDMA is a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer). In the summer of 2019, the FDA became aware of independent laboratory testing that found NDMA in ranitidine. Low levels of NDMA are commonly ingested in the diet, for example NDMA is present in foods and in water. These low levels would not be expected to lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. However, sustained higher levels of exposure may increase the risk of cancer in humans. The FDA conducted thorough laboratory tests and found NDMA in ranitidine at low levels. At the time, the agency did not have enough scientific evidence to recommend whether individuals should continue or stop taking ranitidine medicines, and continued its investigation and warned the public in of the potential risks and to consider alternative OTC and prescription treatments. New FDA testing and evaluation prompted by information from third-party laboratories confirmed that NDMA levels increase in ranitidine even under normal storage conditions, and NDMA has been found to increase significantly in samples stored at higher temperatures, including temperatures the product may be exposed to during distribution and handling by consumers. The testing also showed that the older a ranitidine product is, or the longer the length of time since it was manufactured, the greater the level of NDMA. These conditions may raise the level of NDMA in the ranitidine product above the acceptable daily intake limit. With today’s announcement, the FDA is sending letters to all manufacturers of ranitidine requesting they withdraw their products from the market. The FDA is also advising consumers taking OTC ranitidine to stop taking any tablets or liquid they currently have, dispose of them properly and not buy more; for those who wish to continue treating their condition, they should consider using other approved OTC products. Patients taking prescription ranitidine should speak with their health care professional about other treatment options before stopping the medicine, as there are multiple drugs approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine that do not carry the same risks from NDMA. To date, the FDA’s testing has not found NDMA in famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid) or omeprazole (Prilosec). In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA recommends patients and consumers not take their medicines to a drug take-back location but follow the specific disposal instructions in the or follow the agency’s recommended , which include ways to safely dispose of these medications at home. The FDA continues its ongoing review, surveillance, compliance and pharmaceutical quality efforts across every product area, and will continue to work with drug manufacturers to ensure safe, effective and high-quality drugs for the American public.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Supply Chain Update", "date": "February 27, 2020", "contents": " As I have previously communicated, the FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S. A manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list. The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug. It is important to note that there are other alternatives that can be used by patients. We are working with the manufacturer as well as other manufacturers to mitigate the shortage. We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage. Since January 24, the FDA has been in touch with more than 180 manufacturers of human drugs, not only to remind them of applicable legal requirements for notifying the FDA of any anticipated supply disruptions, but also asking them to evaluate their entire supply chain, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (the main ingredient in the drug and part that produces the intended effects, e.g., acetaminophen) and other components manufactured in China. Also, as part of our efforts, the FDA has identified about 20 other drugs, which solely source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products from China. We have been in contact with those firms to assess whether they face any drug shortage risks due to the outbreak. None of these firms have reported any shortage to date. Also, these drugs are considered non-critical drugs. We will remain in contact with manufacturers so that we can continue to assist them with any potential issues in the fastest way. We are aware of 63 manufacturers which represent 72 facilities in China that produce essential medical devices; we have contacted all of them. Essential devices are those that may be prone to potential shortage if there is a supply disruption. We are aware that several of these facilities in China are adversely affected by COVID-19, citing workforce challenges, including the necessary quarantine of workers. While the FDA continues to assess whether manufacturing disruptions will affect overall market availability of these products, there are currently no reported shortages for these types of medical devices within the U.S. market. Regarding personal protective equipment—surgical gowns, gloves, masks, respirator protective devices, or other medical equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness—the FDA has heard reports of increased market demand and supply challenges for some of these products. However, the FDA is currently not aware of specific widespread shortages of medical devices, but we are aware of reports from CDC and other U.S. partners of increased ordering of a range of human medical products through distributors as some healthcare facilities in the U.S. are preparing for potential needs if the outbreak becomes severe. It is important to note that no law exists requiring medical device manufacturers to notify the FDA when they become aware of a circumstance, including discontinuation of a product, that could lead to a potential shortage, and manufacturers are not required to respond when the FDA requests information about potential supply chain disruption. As with prior emergencies, the FDA has taken proactive steps to establish and remain in contact with medical device manufacturers and others in the supply chain, including hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The agency also encourages manufacturers and healthcare facilities to report any supply disruptions to the device shortages mailbox, . This mailbox is closely monitored and has proven to be a valuable surveillance resource to augment FDA efforts to detect and mitigate potential supply chain disruption. The FDA is not aware of any cellular or gene therapies that are made in China for the U.S. market. There are no shortages of biologics to report at this time. The potential for transmission of COVID-19 by blood and blood components is unknown at this time; however, respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Further, there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19. The FDA has made information available to blood establishments and to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products that may wish to consider additional donor screening measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. However, it is always important to follow practices (i.e., wash hands and surfaces often, separate raw meat from other foods, cook to the right temperature, and refrigerate foods promptly) when handling or preparing foods. There are 32 animal drug firms that make finished drugs or source active pharmaceutical ingredients in China for the U.S. The FDA has contacted all 32 firms and no shortages have been reported at this time. However, six of those firms have indicated that they are seeing disruptions in the supply chain that soon could lead to shortages. The FDA is working with these firms to help identify interventions to mitigate potential shortages. The FDA is using all our existing authorities to address COVID-19, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to further strengthen our response capabilities and emergency preparedness. There are four specific proposals included in the President’s budget that would better equip the FDA to prevent or mitigate medical product shortages. Overall, this remains an evolving and very dynamic issue. We are committed to continuing to communicate with the public as we have further updates. We also continue to aggressively monitor the market for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 diagnosis, prevention or treatment claims. The FDA can and will use every authority at our disposal to protect consumers from bad actors who take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public, including pursuing warning letters, seizures or injunctions against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law. We know the public may have questions or concerns for the FDA as a result of this outbreak, including you and your family’s risk of exposure, or whether your critical medical products are safe and will continue to be available in the future. The FDA is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate emerging coronavirus issues through collaborative efforts with federal partners, international regulators and medical product developers and manufacturers to help advance response efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Generic of Daraprim", "date": "February 28, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved an application for the first generic of Daraprim (pyrimethamine) tablets for the treatment of toxoplasmosis (an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii) when used with a sulfonamide (a group of medicines used to treat bacterial infections). Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii that, when severe, can cause damage to the brain, eyes or other organs. A Toxoplasma infection can occur, among other ways, by eating undercooked, contaminated meat or shellfish; drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma; or by accidental swallowing of the parasite through contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. It is considered to be the leading cause of death attributed to foodborne illness in the United States. Severe toxoplasmosis is more likely in pregnant women and individuals who have weak immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS, those taking certain types of chemotherapy and those who have recently received an organ transplant. However, occasionally even persons with healthy immune systems may experience eye damage from toxoplasmosis. Addressing the challenges related to developing generics and promoting more generic competition is a key part of the FDA’s and the agency’s efforts to help increase patient access to more affordable medicines. Generic prescription drugs approved by the FDA have the same safety and efficacy as brand-name drugs, and the manufacturing and packaging sites must pass the same quality standards as those of brand-name drugs. FDA has shown that greater competition among generic drug makers is associated with lower generic drug prices. One area of focus under the action plan is improving the efficiency of the generic drug development, review and approval process, as well as closing loopholes that allow brand-name drug companies to delay the generic competition. As part of these important efforts, the FDA maintains a list of off-patent, off-exclusivity drug products without an approved generic to improve transparency and encourage the development and submission of applications for drugs with limited competition. Pyrimethamine is included on this list. The FDA also prioritizes the review of submissions for generic drugs for which there are fewer than three approved generic versions for the reference listed drug (RLD) and for which there are no blocking patents or exclusivities on the RLD. Additionally, certain “gaming” tactics have been used at times to delay generic competition. One example is when brand-name drug manufacturers attempt to prevent potential generic applicants from obtaining samples of certain medicines necessary to support approval of a generic drug application. To improve transparency about this issue, the FDA posted a list identifying all drugs for which the FDA has received an inquiry related to limited distribution of the reference drug from a prospective generic applicant. Daraprim is on this list. The most common side effects for pyrimethamine include hypersensitivity reactions (immune responses) that can occasionally be severe, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (two forms of the same life-threatening disease that causes rash, skin peeling and sores on the mucous membranes), erythema multiforme (a skin disorder with bulls-eye-shaped lesions), anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may include difficulty breathing and shock) and hyperphenylalaninemia (elevated concentration of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood), particularly when pyrimethamine is administered at the same time as a sulfonamide. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia (a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), pancytopenia (low counts of white and red blood cells, as well as platelets), neutropenia (low level of the white blood cells called neutrophils), atrophic glossitis (a condition of the tongue), hematuria (the presence of blood in urine) and disorders of cardiac rhythm. Hematologic (blood) effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals. Pulmonary eosinophilia (inflammation of the lungs from an increase in the white blood cell eosinophils) has been reported rarely. Pyrimethamine should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine or with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate (a naturally-occurring B vitamin) deficiency. Women who are taking pyrimethamine should not become pregnant. Patients should keep pyrimethamine out of the reach of children. A small “starting” dose for toxoplasmosis is recommended in patients with convulsive disorders to avoid the potential nervous system toxicity of pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal (kidney) or hepatic (liver) function or in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy, such as phenytoin (an anti-epileptic drug), affecting folate levels.

The virus has been named “SARS-CoV2” and the disease it causes has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the capability to rapidly spread, leading to significant impact on health care systems and causing societal disruption. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the U.S. To effectively respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, rapid detection of cases and contacts, appropriate clinical management and infection control, and implementation of community mitigation efforts are critical. This can best be achieved with wide availability of testing capabilities in health care settings, reference and commercial laboratories, and at the point of care. The new policy is for certain laboratories that develop and begin to use validated COVID-19 diagnostics before the FDA has completed review of their (EUA) requests. The FDA can issue an EUA to permit the use, based on scientific data, of certain medical products that may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease or condition when there is a determination, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), that there is a public health emergency or a significant potential for a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens, and a declaration that circumstances exist justifying the medical products’ emergency use. On Feb. 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS determined that there is a public health emergency and that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the COVID-19 outbreak. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. requires wide availability of diagnostic testing to control the emergence of a rapidly spreading, severe illness. The FDA has authorized one EUA for COVID-19 that is in use by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and some public health labs across the country. The guidance issued today describes a policy enabling laboratories to immediately use tests they developed and validated in order to achieve more rapid testing capacity in the U.S. The immediately in effect guidance issued today describes the circumstances where the FDA does not intend to object to the use of these tests for clinical testing while the laboratories are pursuing an EUA with the FDA. Importantly, this policy only applies to laboratories that are certified to perform high-complexity testing consistent with requirements under The FDA guidance provides recommendations for test developers, including information regarding test validation, FDA notification and interim confirmatory clinical testing. Following the completion of their test validation, laboratories should communicate with the FDA, via email, in order to notify the agency that the test has been validated. Laboratories should submit a completed EUA request within 15 business days of notification.

{"title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Update: Foreign Inspections", "date": "March 10, 2020", "contents": " Today, we are providing an update on the status of U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections outside of the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. After careful consideration, the FDA is postponing most foreign inspections through April, effective immediately. Inspections outside the U.S. deemed mission-critical will still be considered on a case-by-case basis. The FDA based this decision on a number of factors, including State Department Level 4 travel advisories in which travel is prohibited for U.S. government employees, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel recommendations, access restrictions being imposed on foreign visitors by certain countries, guidance from the Office of Personnel Management and the importance of the health and safety of our employees. Another critical factor in taking this action is the confidence we have in our ability to maintain oversight over international manufacturers and imported products using alternative tools and methods. We are aware of how this action may impact other FDA responsibilities, including product application reviews. We will be vigilant and monitor the situation very closely and will try to mitigate potential impacts from this outbreak in lockstep with the whole of the federal government. We stand ready to resume foreign inspections as soon as feasible. When we are temporarily not able to physically inspect foreign produced FDA-regulated products or manufacturers, as an interim measure we employ additional tools to ensure the safety of products imported to the U.S., which have proved effective in the past. These include denying entry of unsafe products into the U.S., physical examinations and/or product sampling at our borders, reviewing a firm’s previous compliance history, using information sharing from foreign governments as part of mutual recognition and confidentiality agreements and requesting records “in advance of or in lieu of” on-site drug inspections. For example, we began exercising this authority when we postponed on-the-ground inspections of manufacturers of FDA-regulated products in China earlier in the outbreak. This is all part of the FDA’s multi-pronged and risk-based approach to ensuring quality, as well as compliance, with applicable federal laws and regulations. The FDA will continue working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the U.S. that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products, which may come from a variety of sources, such as first-time importers unfamiliar with regulatory requirements or repeat offenders trying to skirt the law. The FDA has the ability through our risk-based import screening tool (PREDICT) to focus our examinations and sample collections based on heightened concerns of specific products being entered into U.S. commerce. The PREDICT screening continues to adjust risk scores as necessary throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We are keeping a close eye out for indications of port shopping or cargo diversion and will continue our oversight of shipments through potentially higher-risk venues such as International Mail Facilities. We can refuse admission of products that fail sample testing or may violate other applicable legal requirements. Americans can rest assured the FDA is diligently monitoring this outbreak and the impact to our operations. Our leadership team meets daily to talk about the myriad of urgent issues facing us as we actively facilitate efforts to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease; survey the medical product supply chain for potential shortages or disruptions and help to mitigate such impacts, as necessary; and leverage the full breadth of our public health tools, including enforcement tools to stop fraudulent COVID-19 activity. As this remains a dynamic situation, we will continue to assess and calibrate our approach as needed to help advance federal response efforts in the fight against this outbreak.

{"title": "FDA Launches New Campaign to Help Consumers Use the New Nutrition Facts Label", "date": "March 11, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today launched an initiative to help consumers use the new Nutrition Facts label that appears on packaged foods to maintain healthy dietary practices. The campaign with the tagline “ ” aims to reach the general public and also focuses on consumers at increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases, including obesity. The campaign includes videos and educational materials of “food products” modeling their new looks, including on a fashion runway, after receiving a makeover. The new label was finalized in May 2016, and most manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales had until January 2020 to begin using it on their products. Most manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales have an additional year, until Jan. 1, 2021, to start using the new label – although many already have. The new label is most distinguishable by its bold listings for serving sizes and calorie counts. Additional changes include new required listings for added sugars, vitamin D and potassium, and a dual column version of the label for food packages that contain 2-3 servings which can be reasonably consumed at one time. On the dual column label, one column lists the nutritional facts related to a single serving, and the other column lists nutritional facts for the contents of the entire package. The new label is the first redesign of the Nutrition Facts in more than 20 years, and its design is based on updated scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease. Serving sizes have also been updated to reflect that the amount of food and beverages people eat and drink has changed. The new campaign is part of the FDA’s comprehensive, multi-year , which is designed to empower consumers with information about healthy food choices and to facilitate industry innovation toward healthier foods. In addition to educating consumers, aspects of the campaign have been developed for health care professionals, teachers, dietitians and community leaders, who can help relay information to consumers.

The warning letters were sent to some establishments with well-known names such as 7-Eleven and Shell and are the first of what will be a series of ongoing actions consistent with the FDA’s for e-cigarettes and other deemed products on the market. this year, the FDA is prioritizing enforcement against the following unauthorized ENDS products: 1) flavored, cartridge-based ENDS products (other than tobacco or menthol flavored); 2) all other ENDS products for which the manufacturer has failed to take adequate measures to prevent underage access; and 3) any ENDS product that is targeted to youth or likely to promote use by youth. Under this policy, companies that do not cease manufacture, distribution and sale of these unauthorized tobacco products risk FDA regulatory actions ranging from warning letters to injunction, seizure and/or civil money penalty actions. The following manufacturers received a The following retailers received a The warning letters notify the retailers and manufacturers that selling or distributing ENDS products without a marketing authorization order to customers in the U.S. is prohibited under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Retailers and distributors are encouraged to communicate with their suppliers to discuss possible options for the unauthorized products in their inventory. Additionally, as part of the agency’s efforts, the FDA recently issued import alerts ( ) for certain unauthorized ENDS products offered for import into the U.S. based on the agency’s enforcement priorities. These import alerts describe products that, if imported, would violate the FD&C Act. These import alerts were issued in advance of any specific products being detained. The agency also recently issued separate letters to nine manufacturers and importers seeking information about their ENDS products, including requesting evidence that the product is legally marketed and was not introduced or modified after Aug. 8, 2016, the effective date of the final rule that extended the FDA’s tobacco product authorities to all tobacco products. As of March 10, 2020, the FDA has seeking information about more than 140 ENDS products. A number of companies have now removed products from the market. Ultimately, manufacturers that intend to market any of these products—including flavored e-cigarettes or e-liquids—must submit an application to the FDA that demonstrates that the product meets the applicable standard in the law, such as whether the product is appropriate for the protection of the public health. If a company can demonstrate to the FDA that a specific product meets the applicable standard set forth by Congress, including considering how the marketing of the product may affect youth initiation and use, then the agency may authorize that product for sale. Although the FDA is prioritizing enforcement against certain ENDS products sooner, manufacturers of deemed new products that lack premarket authorization must submit premarket applications by May 12, 2020. All of these efforts, in addition to the recent law and the recent expansion of the FDA’s public education to include videos featuring teenagers sharing cautionary tales about their e-cigarette addiction, are aimed at keeping these products out of the hands of youth. In the coming days, the agency also plans to release for middle and high-school educators and school administrators. The FDA continues to monitor youth use of all e-cigarette products and will continue to expand its public education efforts and use the agency’s regulatory authority—changing course as necessary—to further ensure all tobacco products, and e-cigarette products in particular, are not marketed to, sold to or used by youth.

The FDA issued the fourth COVID-19 diagnostic Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Thermo Fisher for its TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit. “This action today shows our agency’s dedication to working around the clock to review and authorize diagnostics during this public health emergency,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “We have been engaging with test developers and encouraging them to come to the FDA and work with us. Since the beginning of this outbreak, more than 80 test developers have sought our assistance with development and validation of tests they plan to bring through the Emergency Use Authorization process. Additionally, more than 30 laboratories have notified us they are testing or intend to begin testing soon under our new policy for laboratory-developed tests for this emergency. The number of products in the pipeline reflects the significant role diagnostics play in this outbreak and the large number of organizations we are working with to bring tests to market.” The FDA issued an EUA to Thermo Fisher for its diagnostic test within 24 hours of receiving the request.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA gives flexibility to New York State Department of Health, FDA issues Emergency Use Authorization diagnostic", "date": "March 13, 2020", "contents": " Yesterday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took two significant actions in the agency’s ongoing and aggressive commitment to address the coronavirus outbreak (COVID19). First, the agency issued enforcement discretion and is not objecting to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) authorizing certain laboratories in New York to begin patient testing after validating their tests and notifying the NYSDOH. Under NYSDOH’s approach, laboratories will provide validation data to NYSDOH within 15 days in lieu of pursuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with FDA. Second, the FDA authorized the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test, the third Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted for a diagnostic test during the COVID-19 outbreak. “These actions today show our commitment to working around the clock to help expedite the availability of tests. This NYSDOH action shows the FDA’s extreme flexibility and adaptability during times of public health emergencies,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “As a practical matter, what this action means is that labs, authorized by NYSDOH, will not engage with FDA to begin patient testing. Nor will they get an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. These labs will interact solely with NYSDOH, which should expedite the availability of patient testing in New York State. This action demonstrates FDA’s responsiveness to the needs of our country during this time.” The FDA is granting this flexibility to NYSDOH based on the urgent public health need for additional testing capacity. The FDA weighed several factors in this decision, including that the NYSDOH has a long-established framework in place for oversight of laboratory developed tests in New York State. The FDA had also previously accredited Wadsworth be a third-party reviewer for certain molecular tests. Additionally, the FDA issued an EUA to Roche Molecular Systems for its cobas SARS-CoV-2 test within 24 hours of receiving the application. This is the first commercially distributed diagnostic test to receive an EUA during the COVID-19 outbreak. To expedite access to this test, FDA did not object to Roche pre-positioning its test so that labs could be ready to initiate testing immediately upon authorization of the EUA. Because of that pre-positioning, laboratories can immediately run tests on Roche’s high-volume platform, which will greatly increase national testing capacity. “We have been encouraging test developers to come to the FDA and work with us,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Since the beginning of this outbreak, more than 60 developers have sought our assistance with development and validation of tests they plan to bring through the Emergency Use Authorization process.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA and CDC take action to increase access to respirators, including N95s, for health care personnel", "date": "March 02, 2020", "contents": " Today, in a joint effort, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make more respirators, including certain N95s, available to health care personnel. Currently, the majority of respirators on the market are indicated for use in industrial settings. Today’s action allows certain National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved respirators not currently regulated by the FDA to be used in a health care setting by health care personnel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, thereby maximizing the number of respirators available to meet the needs of the U.S. health care system. Respiratory protective devices are designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. When properly fitted, respirators, such as N95s, can filter more airborne particles than face masks, which is important during an outbreak of a respiratory disease like COVID-19. The FDA regulates respirators intended for use in a health care setting, however, most respirators are used in construction and other industrial jobs only and are therefore not required to meet the FDA requirements for testing. Today, the FDA granted the CDC’s request for an emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow health care personnel to use certain industrial respirators during the COVID-19 outbreak in health care settings. The FDA concluded that respirators approved by NIOSH, but not currently meeting the FDA’s requirements, may be effective in preventing health care personnel from airborne exposure, including COVID-19, which can cause serious or life-threatening disease, including severe respiratory illness. Given the increased demand and supply challenges on the availability of respirators, today’s EUA helps to provide alternatives that can enable more health care personnel to have access to this potentially lifesaving personal protective equipment. This action is the result of the close collaboration between the FDA and the CDC to prioritize access to needed medical products during this outbreak to support health care personnel. Of note, the agencies are not currently aware of specific widespread shortages of personal protective equipment, but there are reports of increased ordering of these products and shortages have been observed in some U.S. health care institutions. The FDA and CDC are aware that as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to expand globally, the supply chain for these devices will continue to be substantially stressed as demand exceeds available supplies. Under the circumstances of this emergency, nationwide shortages are anticipated. The FDA and CDC are taking steps to address the observed and anticipated shortages by expanding the use of respirators that are NIOSH approved, but do not currently meet FDA regulatory requirements. This action today is part of an overall HHS strategy to help optimize the availability and use of respirators for health care personnel. Additionally, while the EUA today can help increase the availability of certain NIOSH-approved respirators to health care personnel, this EUA does not apply to the public, who should not wear these respirators to protect against COVID-19. There is no added health benefit to the general American public to wear a respiratory protective device (such as an N95 respirator). The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.

{"title": "FDA Requires Stronger Warning About Risk of Neuropsychiatric Events Associated with Asthma and Allergy Medication Singulair and Generic Montelukast", "date": "March 04, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced that it is requiring a boxed warning – the agency’s most prominent warning – for montelukast (sold under the brand name Singulair and in generic form) to strengthen an existing warning about the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with the drug, which is used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). The boxed warning advises health care providers to avoid prescribing montelukast for patients with mild symptoms, particularly those with allergic rhinitis. As noted in a new issued today, the warning follows the FDA’s review of available data regarding continued reports of neuropsychiatric events with montelukast, such as agitation, depression, sleeping problems, and suicidal thoughts and actions. The Drug Safety Communication includes recommendations for health care professionals and patients and a summary of the data that led to these warnings. The FDA updated the product labeling in 2008 to include information about neuropsychiatric events reported with use of montelukast. In response to continued reports of suicide and other adverse events, the FDA evaluated available data regarding the risk of neuropsychiatric events, including reports submitted through the and observational studies in the published literature. The FDA also conducted an observational study using data in and presented the findings at an FDA advisory committee meeting in 2019. As part of its review, the FDA re-evaluated the benefits and risks of montelukast as the treatment landscape has evolved since the drug was first approved in 1998. Based upon this assessment, the FDA determined the risks of montelukast may outweigh the benefits in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of the disease are mild and can be adequately treated with alternative therapies. For allergic rhinitis in particular, the FDA has determined that montelukast should be reserved for patients who have not responded adequately to other therapies — or who cannot tolerate these therapies. In addition to the boxed warning, the FDA is also requiring a new Medication Guide to be given to patients with each montelukast prescription. Health care professionals and patients should report side effects from montelukast to the The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Informs Patients, Providers and Manufacturers About Potential Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Certain Medical Devices with Bluetooth Low Energy", "date": "March 03, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is informing patients, health care providers and manufacturers about a set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, referred to as “SweynTooth,” that – if exploited - may introduce risks for certain medical devices. SweynTooth affects the wireless communication technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE allows two devices to “pair” and exchange information to perform their intended functions while preserving battery life and can be found in medical devices as well as other devices, such as consumer wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities may allow an unauthorized user to wirelessly crash the device, stop it from working, or access device functions normally only available to the authorized user. To date, the FDA is not aware of any confirmed adverse events related to these vulnerabilities. However, software to exploit these vulnerabilities in certain situations is publicly available. Today, the FDA is providing additional information regarding the source of these vulnerabilities and recommendations for reducing or avoiding risks the vulnerabilities may pose to a variety of medical devices, such as pacemakers, glucose monitors, and ultrasound devices. said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA is currently aware of several microchip manufacturers that are affected by these vulnerabilities: Texas Instruments, NXP, Cypress, Dialog Semiconductors, Microchip, STMicroelectronics and Telink Semiconductor. Their microchips may be in a variety of medical devices, such as those that are implanted in or worn by a patient (such as pacemakers, stimulators, blood glucose monitors and insulin pumps) or larger devices that are in health care facilities (such as electrocardiograms, monitors and diagnostic devices like ultrasound devices). Medical device manufacturers are already assessing which devices may be affected by SweynTooth and are identifying risk and remediation actions. In addition, several microchip manufacturers have already released patches. For more information about SweynTooth cybersecurity vulnerabilities – including a list of affected devices, see The agency is asking medical device manufacturers to communicate to health care providers and patients which medical devices could be affected by SweynTooth and ways to reduce associated risk. Patients should talk to their health care providers to determine if their medical device could be affected and to seek help right away if they think their medical device is not working as expected. The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices very seriously and today’s safety communication includes recommendations to manufacturers for continued monitoring, reporting and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA is recommending that manufacturers conduct a risk assessment, as described in the FDA’s , to evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities on medical devices they manufacture and develop risk mitigation plans. Medical device manufacturers should work with the microchip manufacturers to identify available patches and other recommended mitigation methods, work with health care providers to determine any medical devices that could potentially be affected, and discuss ways to reduce associated risks. The FDA will continue to assess new information concerning the SweynTooth vulnerabilities and will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available. Further, the FDA will continue its ongoing work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to help develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device's total product lifecycle.

{"title": "FDA Takes Rare Step to Ban Electrical Stimulation Devices for Self-Injurious or Aggressive Behavior", "date": "March 04, 2020", "contents": " After careful consideration, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today published a final rule to ban electrical stimulation devices (ESDs) used for self-injurious or aggressive behavior because they present an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury that cannot be corrected or eliminated through new or updated device labeling. ESDs administer electrical shocks through electrodes attached to the skin of individuals to immediately interrupt self-injurious or aggressive behavior or attempt to condition the individuals to stop engaging in such behavior. Evidence indicates a number of significant psychological and physical risks are associated with the use of these devices, including worsening of underlying symptoms, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, pain, burns and tissue damage. In addition, many people who are exposed to these devices have intellectual or developmental disabilities that make it difficult to communicate their pain. Evidence of the device’s effectiveness is weak and evidence supporting the benefit-risk profiles of alternatives is strong. As the risks presented by ESDs meet the agency’s definition of unreasonable and substantial and cannot be corrected or eliminated through new or updated labeling, banning the product is necessary to protect public health. The act of banning a device is rare and the circumstances under which the agency can take this action is stringent, but the FDA has the authority to take this action when necessary to protect the health of the public. The FDA has only two other medical devices since gaining the authority to do so. This final rule issued today follows a 2016 proposed rule to ban ESDs from the marketplace and takes effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. The FDA understands that a gradual transition period may be needed for a subgroup of individuals currently exposed to these devices, to allow time for them to transition to another treatment, so the agency is establishing two compliance dates. For devices in use on specific individuals as of the date of publication and subject to a physician-directed transition plan, compliance is required 180 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. For all other devices, compliance is required 30 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. The FDA received more than 1,500 comments on the proposed rule, as well as approximately 300 comments submitted to the docket, which the FDA has associated with this rulemaking action. Comments were received from a variety of stakeholders, including parents of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, state agencies and their sister public-private organizations, the affected manufacturer and residential facility, some of the facility’s employees, and parents of individual residents. State and federal legislators also expressed interest, as did state and national advocacy groups. The overwhelming majority of comments supported this ban. The final rule bears minor changes from the proposed rule, including clarification of which devices are banned and an explanation that this ban is not a special control that allows continued use of the device. A full list of changes is available within the At this time, the FDA has information that indicates only one facility is using these devices in the United States, the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC) in Canton, Massachusetts, and estimates between 45 and 50 individuals are currently being exposed to the device. The FDA believes that state-of-the-art behavioral treatments, such as positive behavioral support, and medications can enable health care providers to find alternative approaches for curbing self-injurious or aggressive behaviors in their patients. In making the determination that these products present an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury to the public and therefore meet the regulatory standard for banning, the FDA considered all available evidence, including clinical and scientific data; input from experts in the field and state agencies; and comments from JRC, individuals and parents of individuals on whom ESDs have been used, and disability rights groups; as well as insights from the expert members of the This rule applies only to ESDs used for self-injurious or aggressive behavior and does not apply to aversive conditioning devices used for other purposes, such as those used for smoking cessation, which are outside the scope of this rule, or other FDA-cleared or approved devices or technologies such as cranial electrotherapy stimulators or transcranial magnetic stimulation, both of which have been found to have a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for different indications.

{"title": "FDA informs health care providers, facilities and patients about potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities for certain GE Healthcare Clinical Information Central Stations and Telemetry Servers", "date": "January 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is issuing a informing health care providers, facilities and patients about cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified for certain GE Healthcare Clinical Information Central Stations and Telemetry Servers. These devices are primarily used in health care facilities for displaying patient information, such as the physiologic status (i.e., temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, etc.) of a patient, and monitoring patient status from a central location in a facility, such as a nurse’s bay. The cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified could allow an attacker to remotely take control of the device to silence alarms, generate false alarms or interfere with the function of patient monitors connected to these devices. For example, an attacker could potentially silence an alarm that is intended to communicate vital information about a patient to health care staff, such as a patient’s cardiac status. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities were identified by a third-party security firm. To date, the agency has not received any adverse event reports, including reports of patient harm or device malfunction, associated with these vulnerabilities. “Medical devices connected to a communications network can offer numerous advantages over non-connected devices, such as access to more convenient or more timely health care. However, when a medical device is connected to a communications network, there is a risk that cybersecurity vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker, which could result in patient harm,” said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, acting director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The agency understands that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility with the medical device industry, health care delivery organizations, patients, security researchers and other government agencies. Today’s alert regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities in certain GE Healthcare stations and servers is a key example of the FDA’s commitment to work with all stakeholders to address cybersecurity issues that affect medical devices in order to keep patients safe.” The vulnerabilities of certain GE Healthcare Clinical Information Central Stations and Telemetry Servers are such that an attack could occur undetected and without user interaction. Because an attack may be interpreted by the affected device as normal or routine network communications, it may remain invisible to existing security measures. Given the potential for patient harm, GE Healthcare has contacted health care providers and facilities that have these devices and has provided information on the vulnerability in addition to instructions for mitigating risk and where to find the software updates or patches when they become available. The FDA’s safety communication issued today alerts health care providers and facilities of the risk posed by these vulnerabilities and provides recommendations on actions that can be taken to mitigate risks. These recommendations include advising health care facilities to segregate the network connecting the patient monitors with the affected GE Healthcare Clinical Information Central Stations and Telemetry Servers from the rest of the hospital network, and using firewalls, segregated networks, virtual private networks, network monitors, or other technologies that minimize the risk of remote or local network attacks. The agency is committed to communicating cybersecurity vulnerabilities to the public and has issued for medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities since 2013. The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices seriously and today’s safety communication includes recommendations to health care providers and facilities for continued monitoring, reporting and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA will continue its work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to help address cybersecurity issues throughout a device's total product lifecycle. The FDA is continuously assessing new information concerning cybersecurity vulnerabilities for medical devices, and will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment option specifically for patients with epithelioid sarcoma, a rare soft tissue cancer", "date": "January 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Tazverik (tazemetostat) for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) or locally advanced (when cancer has grown outside the organ it started in, but has not yet spread to distant parts of the body) epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection (surgically removing all of a tissue, structure, or organ). Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare sub-type of soft tissue sarcoma that often occurs in young adults. “Epithelioid sarcoma accounts for less than one percent of all soft tissue sarcomas,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Until today, there were no treatment options specifically for patients with epithelioid sarcoma. The approval of Tazverik provides a treatment option that specifically targets this disease. When we brought Tazverik’s application to the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee last month, the committee voted unanimously that the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks.” Tazverik blocks activity of the EZH2 methyltransferase, which may help keep the cancer cells from growing. Most cases of epithelioid sarcoma begin in the soft tissue under the skin of an extremity, though it can start in other areas of the body. Surgical removal is considered the main treatment when the cancer is localized to one area of the body. Chemotherapy or radiation may also be given. However, there is a high likelihood for local and regional spread of the disease even with treatment and approximately 50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastatic disease is considered life-threatening to the patient. Tazverik’s approval was based on the results of a clinical trial enrolling 62 patients with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma. During the clinical trial, patients received 800 milligrams (mg) of Tazverik twice a day until the disease progressed or the patient reached an unacceptable level of toxicity. Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks during the clinical trial. The trial measured how many patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage (by a certain amount) of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). The overall response rate was 15%, with 1.6% of patients having a complete response and 13% having a partial response. Of the nine patients that had a response, six (67%) patients had a response lasting six months or longer. The most common side effects for patients taking Tazverik were pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting and constipation. Patients treated with Tazverik are at increased risk of developing secondary malignancies including: T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system usually found in the lymph nodes), myelodysplastic syndrome (a disorder resulting from poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells) and acute myeloid leukemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow). The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tazverik and for six months after the final dose. Males with a female partner of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Tazverik and for three months after the final dose. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Tazverik because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Tazverik must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Tazverik was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on a result that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients.

{"title": "FDA Continues Strong Support of Innovation in Development of Gene Therapy Products", "date": "January 28, 2020", "contents": " This is a pivotal time in the field of gene therapy as the FDA continues its efforts to support innovators developing new medical products for Americans and others around the world. To date, the FDA has approved four gene therapy products, which insert new genetic material into a patient’s cells. The agency anticipates many more approvals in the coming years, as evidenced by the more than 900 investigational new drug (IND) applications for ongoing clinical studies in this area. The FDA believes this will provide patients and providers with increased therapeutic choices. In that spirit, today, the FDA is announcing the release of a number of important policies: six final guidances on gene therapy manufacturing and clinical development of products and a draft guidance, Interpreting Sameness of Gene Therapy Products Under the Orphan Drug Regulations. One of the most important steps the FDA can take to support safe innovation in this field is to create policies that provide product developers with meaningful guidance to answer critical questions as they research and design their gene therapy products. The six final guidances issued today provide the agency’s recommendations for product developers on manufacturing issues and recommendations for those focusing on gene therapy products to address specific disease areas. The six guidance documents incorporate input from many stakeholders and take a significant step toward helping to shape the modern structure for the development and manufacture of gene therapies. The agency is issuing this suite of documents to help advance the field of gene therapy while providing recommendations to help ensure that these innovative products meet the FDA’s standards for safety and effectiveness. The scientific review of gene therapies includes the need to evaluate highly complex information on product manufacturing and quality. In addition, the clinical review of these products frequently poses more challenging questions to regulators than reviews of more conventional drugs, such as questions about the durability of response, and these questions often can’t be fully answered in pre-market trials of reasonable size and duration. For some gene therapy products, therefore, although they have met the FDA’s standards for approval, we may need to accept some level of uncertainty around questions of the duration of the response at the time of marketing authorization. Effective tools for reliable post-market follow up, such as post-market clinical trials, are going to be key to advancing this field and helping to ensure that our approach fosters safe and innovative treatments. The draft guidance on interpreting sameness of gene therapy products under the orphan drug regulations provides the FDA’s proposed current thinking on an interpretation of sameness between gene therapy products for the purposes of obtaining orphan-drug designation and eligibility for orphan-drug exclusivity. The draft guidance focuses on how the FDA will evaluate differences between gene therapy products when they are intended to treat the same disease. As laid out in the draft guidance and our regulations, the agency’s determination will consider the principal molecular structural features of the gene therapy products, which includes transgenes (the transferred gene) and vectors (the vehicle for delivering the transgene to a cell). With the large volume of products currently being studied, gene therapy product developers have asked the agency important questions about orphan-drug designation incentives to develop products for rare diseases with very small patient populations. The draft guidance has potential positive implications both for product developers and patients by providing insight into the agency’s most current thinking on the sameness of products, and thus, not discourage the development of multiple gene therapy products to treat the same disease or condition. For patients, this policy could help lead to the development and approval of multiple treatments, creating a more competitive market with choices.  We encourage stakeholders to provide their comments. In sum, these policy documents are representative of efforts to help advance product development in the field of gene therapy. We will continue to work with product innovators, sponsors, researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to help make the development and review of these products more efficient, while putting in place the regulatory controls needed to ensure that the resulting therapies are both safe and effective. We also encourage developers of new gene therapy products to make full use of our expedited programs available for products intended to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. These programs include breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation, and fast track designation, as well as priority review and accelerated approval. Developers should pursue these programs whenever possible to help bring the benefits of important advances to patients as soon as possible. We believe our work will help advance innovations in a way that assures their safety and effectiveness, provides new therapeutic choices to patients and providers and continues to build confidence in this novel and emerging area of medicine.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed on available therapies", "date": "December 20, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) for the treatment of adults with unresectable (unable to be removed with surgery) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Enhertu is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, meaning that the drug targets the changes in HER2 that help the cancer grow, divide and spread, and is linked to a topoisomerise inhibitor, which is a chemical compound that is toxic to cancer cells. “There have been many advances in the development of drugs for HER2-positive breast cancer since the introduction of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in 1998. The approval of Enhertu represents the newest treatment option for patients who have progressed on available HER2-directed therapies,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Drug development in the area of targeted therapies builds on our scientific understanding of malignant diseases not only in breast cancer, but in multiple other diseases.” HER2-positive breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. Approximately one of every five breast cancers have a gene mutation in the cancer cells that makes an excess of the HER2 protein. HER2-positive breast cancers are an aggressive type of breast cancer. Enhertu’s approval was based on the results of a clinical trial enrolling 184 female patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 therapies in the metastatic setting. These patients were heavily pretreated in the metastatic setting, receiving between two and 17 therapies prior to receiving Enhertu. Patients in the clinical trial received Enhertu every three weeks and tumor imagining was obtained every six weeks. The overall response rate was 60.3%, which reflects the percentage of patients that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response of 14.8 months. The prescribing information for Enhertu includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of interstitial lung disease (a group of lung conditions that causes scarring of lung tissues) and embryo-fetal toxicity. Interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), including cases resulting in death, have been reported with Enhertu. Health care professionals should monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing), fever and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. If these symptoms arise, Enhertu may need to be withheld, the dose reduced or permanently discontinued. Women who are pregnant should not take Enhertu because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby, or cause delivery complications. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age, and males with a female partner of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment with Enhertu. The most common side effects for patients taking Enhertu were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia (hair loss), constipation, decreased appetite, anemia (hemoglobin in blood is below the reference range), decreased neutrophil count (white blood cells that help lead your body’s immune system response to fight infection), diarrhea, leukopenia (other white blood cells that help the immune system), cough and decreased platelet count (component of blood whose function is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, thereby initiating a blood clot). Decreased neutrophil count is a potentially serious and common side effect as described in the Medication Guide. Patients treated with Enhertu may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to the body, as this has been seen with other HER2-directed therapies for breast cancer. Enhertu was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on a result that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials may be required to verify and describe Enhertu’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Enhertu was also granted designation, which expedites the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This application was approved four months prior to the FDA goal date. The FDA granted the approval of Enhertu to Daiichi Sankyo.

{"title": "FDA approves the first targeted therapy to treat a rare mutation in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors", "date": "January 09, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ayvakit (avapritinib) for the treatment of adults with unresectable (unable to be removed with surgery) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) – a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine – harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. This approval includes GIST that harbors a PDGFRA D842V mutation, which is the most common exon 18 mutation. Ayvakit is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it blocks a type of enzyme called a kinase and helps keeps the cancer cells from growing. “GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation do not respond to standard therapies for GIST. However, today’s approval provides patients with the first drug specifically approved for GIST harboring this mutation,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Clinical trials showed a high response rate with almost 85% of patients experiencing tumor shrinkage with this targeted drug.” GISTs arise from specialized nerve cells found in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. One or more mutations in the DNA of one of these cells may lead to the development of GIST. These cells aid in the movement of food through the intestines and control various digestive processes. More than half of GISTs start in the stomach. Most of the others start in the small intestine, but GISTs can start anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. The activating mutations in PDGFRA have been linked to the development of GISTs, and up to approximately 10% of GIST cases involve mutations of this gene. The FDA approved Ayvakit based on the results of a clinical trial involving 43 patients with GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation. Patients received Ayvakit 300 mg or 400 mg orally once daily until disease progression or they experienced unacceptable toxicity. The recommended dose was determined to be 300 mg once daily. The trial measured how many patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage (by a certain amount) of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). For patients harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, the overall response rate was 84%, with 7% having a complete response and 77% having a partial response. For the subgroup of patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations, the overall response rate was 89%, with 8% having a complete response and 82% having a partial response. While the median duration of response was not reached, 61% of the responding patients with exon 18 mutations had a response lasting six months or longer (31% of patients with an ongoing response were followed for less than six months). Common side effects for patients taking Ayvakit were edema (swelling), nausea, fatigue/asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy), cognitive impairment, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hair color changes, increased lacrimation (secretion of tears), abdominal pain, constipation, rash and dizziness. Ayvakit can cause intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding that occurs inside the skull) in which case the dose should be reduced, or the drug should be discontinued. Ayvakit can also cause central nervous system effects including cognitive impairment, dizziness, sleep disorders, mood disorders, speech disorders and hallucinations. If this happens, depending on the severity, Ayvakit should be withheld and then resumed at the same or reduced dose upon improvement or permanently discontinued. Health care professionals should advise pregnant women that Ayvakit may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Additionally, the FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive potential, and males with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment with Ayvakit and for six weeks after the final dose. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Ayvakit was also granted designation, which expedites the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

{"title": "Statement on the Salinas-linked romaine lettuce E. coli O157:H7 outbreak and status update on investigation ", "date": "January 15, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local partners, on Dec. 12 that public health experts were tracking three separate outbreaks linked to romaine lettuce caused by three different strains of E. coli O157:H7. We also reported that, through the FDA’s traceback investigation, we were able to identify a common grower between each of these outbreaks in Salinas, California based on available supply chain information. Today, the FDA is providing an update on the status of the E. coli O157:H7 illnesses linked to romaine lettuce, along with recent findings based on our investigation of fields linked to a common grower, which was identified in our traceback. It should be noted that romaine from this grower does not explain all of the illnesses seen in these outbreaks. The FDA is lifting the consumer advisory to avoid romaine lettuce from Salinas as the growing season for this region is over, and there is no longer a need for consumers to avoid it. There is also no need to avoid other produce products from Salinas. The FDA and CDC have been tracking two multi-state romaine lettuce outbreaks. Today, federal health officials are declaring both multi-state romaine lettuce outbreaks over. One of the outbreaks sickened 167 people in 27 states. The other outbreak, linked to Fresh Express salad kits, sickened 10 people in five states. There was also a third outbreak in that sickened 11 people. This outbreak has also been declared over. The last reported illness onset date for all the outbreaks was Dec. 21. Based on this information, it appears that our to not eat romaine from Salinas played an important role in preventing illnesses and containing this outbreak because it prompted the removal of romaine lettuce from Salinas from the marketplace and warned consumers to throw away romaine from that growing region. The FDA traceback investigation for these outbreaks required investigators to go through hundreds of supply chain records to find a commonality to a single grower with multiple fields. We were able to narrow this down further to at least 10 fields in the lower Salinas Valley. Investigators from the FDA, CDC, the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the California Department of Public Health, visited several of these fields and took a variety of samples from water, soil and compost. So far, sample results have come back negative for all of the three outbreak strains of E. coli O157:H7. However, we did find a strain of E. coli that is unrelated to any illnesses in a soil sample taken near a run-off point in a buffer zone between a field where product was harvested and where cattle are known to occasionally graze. This could be an important clue that will be further examined as our investigation continues. However, this clue does not explain the illnesses seen in these outbreaks. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are doing everything possible to find the source or sources of contamination. The investigation into how this contamination occurred is important, so romaine growers can implement measures that will prevent future contamination and illnesses. The FDA is planning to conduct an additional, in-depth, root-cause investigation. The investigation will further characterize how contamination might have occurred and will inform what preventive controls are needed to prevent future outbreaks. Once complete, we plan to issue a prompt report and share lessons learned, so that growers can implement best practices to protect consumers from contaminated produce. As we mentioned in our last update, it is important to remember that millions of servings of fresh leafy greens are safely eaten every day by consumers, although the repeat nature of these outbreaks linked to leafy greens – and more specifically to romaine lettuce – remains a concern. We are doing our part by continuing our sampling assignment to monitor for pathogens in romaine lettuce across the nation. Industry can and must do their part too. Everyone across the romaine supply chain must do everything possible to fully understand why and how these outbreaks keep happening and continue to aggressively implement preventive measures to further protect consumers. It’s critical that all stakeholders, including growers, processors, distributors and retailers, stay laser-focused on prevention to help bend the curve of foodborne illness. We understand the importance of food safety, and we know there’s a human face to every foodborne illness. The FDA remains committed to doing everything we can to prevent outbreaks, working with fellow regulators and the food industry to identify and address causes and keep consumers aware of potential risks. Rest assured that we are working hard every day to try to prevent foodborne illness. We also know that food safety is a shared responsibility. It involves food producers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers and certainly regulatory officials at the federal, state, local, territorial and tribal levels. That’s why we work directly with our partners on things such as training and inspections. We also work closely with industry, so they understand our requirements and are educated on the latest scientific standards and good agricultural practices. Working together, we have and will continue to advance food safety. While we will always place emphasis on prevention, being able to promptly respond to an outbreak when it occurs is a critical part of our food safety mission. As public health agencies have gotten better at detecting foodborne illnesses, our ability to trace back to the source of contaminated foods that may have caused the illnesses has lagged, due in part to the lack of modernized food traceability capabilities. As part of the FDA’s , we plan to use advances in technology to improve our ability to track and trace products through the supply chain.

The FDA is working to assess the cause and full impact of these concerns. Surgical gowns are commonly used in health care facilities during surgical procedures and/or to provide moderate to high risk barrier protection. Gowns are classified into four levels of barrier protection based on their liquid barrier performance. Level 3 gowns provide moderate risk protection and are used in a wide-range of surgical procedures, such as open heart surgery and knee replacements. They are intended to be worn to protect both the patient and health care personnel from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids and particulate material. The FDA is working closely with Cardinal Health to understand and address the quality issues with these products, including the potential risks to users and patients, which specific product lots are impacted, and the potential impact on the supply chain. At this time, we are concerned about possible contamination of the products and agree with the manufacturer’s recommendation about not using the affected lots of Level 3 surgical gowns or PreSource procedural packs. We understand the company is continuing to communicate directly with its customers about which specific products are directly impacted by the quality concern and will be issuing a recall soon. We also understand this issue may already be impacting patient care at health care facilities, such as the cancellation of non-elective surgeries. There are very real consequences that medical device supply chain disruptions can have on patients, and we’re committed to taking steps we can to mitigate any adverse patient impact. At this time, we are not aware of any patient harm because of this issue. The FDA is engaged in activities to mitigate supply chain disruption that would negatively impact clinical care operations, including identifying alternative Level 3 gowns. There are numerous FDA-cleared surgical gown alternatives on the market that provide Level 3 barrier protection. We will continue to work with Cardinal Health to keep the public informed about the impact on the supply of Level 3 surgical gowns and potential shortages. Customers with questions about whether their own inventory is affected should contact We encourage healthcare facilities to the FDA with information about potential or actual supply issues. We have a device shortages mailbox ( ) so that any user, patient, manufacturer, or organization within the supply chain that is aware of a delay in distribution of new product, and/or anticipates a potential or actual shortage, can notify us. The FDA will continue to monitor this evolving situation and will continue to communicate with the public on this matter.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for thyroid eye disease ", "date": "January 21, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) for the treatment of adults with thyroid eye disease, a rare condition where the muscles and fatty tissues behind the eye become inflamed, causing the eyes to be pushed forward and bulge outwards (proptosis). Today’s approval represents the first drug approved for the treatment of thyroid eye disease. “Today’s approval marks an important milestone for the treatment of thyroid eye disease. Currently, there are very limited treatment options for this potentially debilitating disease. This treatment has the potential to alter the course of the disease, potentially sparing patients from needing multiple invasive surgeries by providing an alternative, non surgical treatment option,” said Wiley Chambers, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Transplant and Ophthalmology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Additionally, thyroid eye disease is a rare disease that impacts a small percentage of the population, and for a variety of reasons, treatments for rare diseases are often unavailable. This approval represents important progress in the approval of effective treatments for rare diseases, such as thyroid eye disease.” Thyroid eye disease is associated with the outward bulging of the eye that can cause a variety of symptoms such as eye pain, double vision, light sensitivity or difficulty closing the eye. This disease impacts a relatively small number of Americans, with more women than men affected. Although this condition impacts relatively few individuals, thyroid eye disease can be incapacitating. For example, the troubling ocular symptoms can lead to the progressive inability of people with thyroid eye disease to perform important daily activities, such as driving or working. Tepezza was approved based on the results of two studies (Study 1 and 2) consisting of a total of 170 patients with active thyroid eye disease who were randomized to either receive Tepezza or a placebo. Of the patients who were administered Tepezza, 71% in Study 1 and 83% in Study 2 demonstrated a greater than 2 millimeter reduction in proptosis (eye protrusion) as compared to 20% and 10% of subjects who received placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Tepezza are muscle spasm, nausea, alopecia (hair loss), diarrhea, fatigue, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), hearing loss, dry skin, dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) and headache. Tepezza should not be used if pregnant, and women of child-bearing potential should have their pregnancy status verified prior to beginning treatment and should be counseled on pregnancy prevention during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Tepezza. The FDA granted this application , in addition to . Additionally, Tepezza received , which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases or conditions. Development of this product was also in part supported by the , which provides grants for clinical studies on safety and efficacy of products for use in rare diseases or conditions.

{"title": "Trump Administration takes historic steps to lower U.S. prescription drug prices", "date": "December 18, 2019", "contents": " Today, President Trump, along with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that, if finalized, would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. In addition, the Administration is announcing the availability of a new draft guidance for industry that describes procedures drug manufacturers can follow to facilitate importation of prescription drugs, including biological products, that are FDA-approved, manufactured abroad, authorized for sale in any foreign country, and originally intended for sale in that foreign country. The NPRM issued today is the first step in implementing a provision of federal law that would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada under specific conditions that ensure the importation poses no additional risk to the public’s health and safety while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer. The draft guidance issued today describes procedures for a drug manufacturer to submit documentation that demonstrates that the product offered for import from any foreign country is, in fact, an FDA-approved drug product, including that it is manufactured in accordance with the FDA-approved application. “Today’s announcement outlines two pathways for the safe importation of certain prescription drugs to help provide safe, effective, more affordable drugs to American patients,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “These are historic actions by HHS and the FDA, and they represent the bold nature of President Trump’s agenda for lowering drug costs. The President has recognized the opportunity to lower costs for American patients through safe importation, and we at HHS and FDA are delivering on that possibility through a safe, commonsense approach.” The NPRM would allow states and certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. An importation program could be co-sponsored by a pharmacist, a wholesaler, or another state or non-federal governmental entity. Referred to as Section 804 Importation Programs, these programs would be authorized by the FDA to manage the importation of certain prescription drugs that are approved in Canada and also meet the conditions in an FDA-approved drug application. Eligible prescription drugs would have to be relabeled with the required U.S. labeling prior to importation and undergo testing for authenticity, degradation, and to ensure that the drugs meet established specifications and standards. Notably, these programs would also have to demonstrate significant cost reductions to the American consumer. “The FDA continues to assess and act on multiple opportunities to promote competition that can, in turn, help reduce drug prices and improve access to medicines for Americans,” said Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir. “The proposed rule and draft guidance include procedures intended to protect the public’s health and safety. We look forward to receiving public comment on these draft policies, and we will take timely comments into account as we work to finalize the rule and guidance. Our ultimate goal is to provide a robust program that clearly lays out procedures to import drugs that could provide lower prices while also maintaining the high quality Americans expect.” Of note, the draft guidance describes procedures drug manufacturers could follow to obtain an additional National Drug Code (NDC) for certain FDA-approved prescription drugs, including biological products, that were originally manufactured, and intended to be marketed, in a foreign country. The use of an additional NDC would allow greater flexibility for drug companies to offer these products at a lower price than what their current distribution contracts require. The draft guidance also recommends that the drug manufacturer include a statement on the product’s label and in the prescribing information to assist pharmacists to accurately identify, dispense and bill for these products. Prescription drugs, including biological products, imported under the pathway described in the draft guidance could be available to patients in a variety of settings, including hospitals, health care providers’ offices, or licensed U.S. pharmacies, and would include the FDA-approved labeling (including prescribing information). Comments on the NPRM are being accepted for 75 days after publication in the Federal Register and comments on the draft guidance are being accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

{"title": "FDA approves new type of therapy to treat advanced urothelial cancer", "date": "December 18, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), a Nectin-4-directed antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate, meaning the drug specifically targets cancer cells – in this case, the cell adhesion molecule Nectin-4, which is highly expressed in urothelial cancers. Padcev is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced (when cancer has grown too large to be surgically removed) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) urothelial cancer who have previously received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy. Platinum-containing chemotherapy, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are standard treatments for patients with bladder cancer, the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. Urothelial cancer, accounting for more than 90% of bladder cancers, begins in cells that line the bladder and nearby organs. Padcev represents a new type of therapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer whose disease has progressed on chemotherapy and immunotherapy. “Antibody-drug conjugates are strategic tools in the targeted treatment of cancer. These conjugates combine the ability of monoclonal antibodies to target specific receptors on cancer cells and then deliver a drug to the cancer cell,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Padcev is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets Nectin-4, a cell surface protein expressed on bladder cancer cells and a cell-killing agent, monomethyl auristantin E.” Padcev was approved based on the results of a clinical trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. The overall response rate, reflecting the percentage of patients who had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage, was 44%, with 12% having a complete response and 32% having a partial response. The median duration of response was 7.6 months. The most common side effects for patients taking Padcev were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage resulting in tingling or numbness), decreased appetite, rash, alopecia (hair loss), nausea, altered taste, diarrhea, dry eye, pruritis (itching) and dry skin. Patients may experience hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) regardless of whether they have diabetes or not, and blood sugar levels should be monitored closely in patients receiving Padcev. Patients should also be monitored for new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and have the dose of Padcev interrupted, reduced or discontinued if needed. Patients may experience eye disorders, including dry eyes and vision changes, while taking Padcev. Health care professionals may consider prophylactic artificial tears for dry eyes and referral to an ophthalmologist for any new symptoms related to the eye. Patients who experience infusion site extravasation (leakage of medications administered through veins into the surrounding tissue) may experience delayed extravasation site reactions with pain, blisters and peeling of skin. Adequate venous access should be ensured prior to starting Padcev. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell patients of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Padcev, and for a period of time thereafter. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Padcev because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby, or cause delivery complications. Padcev was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on a result that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. A further clinical trial is required to verify and describe Padcev’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Padcev received approval approximately three months before the goal date. The FDA granted the approval of Padcev to Astellas Pharma US Inc.

{"title": "First FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease, marking a critical milestone in public health preparedness and response", "date": "December 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today the approval of Ervebo, the first FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years of age and older. Cases of EVD are very rare in the U.S., and those that have occurred have been the result of infections acquired by individuals in other countries who then traveled to the U.S., or health care workers who became ill after treating patients with EVD. “While the risk of Ebola virus disease in the U.S. remains low, the U.S. government remains deeply committed to fighting devastating Ebola outbreaks in Africa, including the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” said Anna Abram, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International Affairs. “Today’s approval is an important step in our continuing efforts to fight Ebola in close coordination with our partners across the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as our international partners, such as the World Health Organization. These efforts, including today’s landmark approval, reflect the FDA’s unwavering dedication to leveraging our expertise to facilitate the development and availability of safe and effective medical products to address urgent public health needs and fight infectious diseases, as part of our vital public health mission.” EVD is contagious and is transmitted through direct contact with blood, body fluids and tissues of infected wild animals or people, as well as with surfaces and materials, such as bedding and clothing, contaminated with these fluids. Onset of symptoms of EVD can be sudden and can include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and in some cases internal and external bleeding. EVD has an incubation period that ranges from 2 to 21 days. Individuals who provide care for people with EVD, including health care workers who do not use correct infection control precautions, are at the highest risk for infection. Confirmed outbreaks of EVD have been documented since the 1970s, primarily in areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where scientists believe the virus is always present at low levels in certain infected wild animals. On rare occasions, people become sick with EVD after coming into direct contact with infected animals, which can then lead to EVD outbreaks when the virus spreads between people. An outbreak in three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) from 2014 to 2016 resulted in more than 28,000 cases of EVD and more than 11,000 deaths that were caused by Zaire ebolavirus. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently experiencing the world’s second largest EVD outbreak. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the DRC began to use Ervebo as an investigational vaccine under an expanded access program to help mitigate this outbreak. With or without vaccination, it is critical to implement appropriate infection control and prevention measures as part of efforts to prevent the spread of EVD. “Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe and often deadly disease that knows no borders. Vaccination is essential to help prevent outbreaks and to stop the Ebola virus from spreading when outbreaks do occur,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The FDA’s approval of Ervebo is a major advance in helping to protect against the Zaire ebolavirus as well as advancing U.S. government preparedness efforts. The research approach used to study the effectiveness and safety of this vaccine was precedent-setting during a public health emergency and may help create a model for future studies under similar circumstances. The FDA is committed to continuing our work across the U.S. government and with our international partners to prevent future Ebola outbreaks and mitigate the current outbreak in the DRC, reflecting our nation’s commitment to preparing for and responding to biological threats, like Ebola.” The approval of Ervebo is supported by a study conducted in Guinea during the 2014-2016 outbreak in individuals 18 years of age and older. The study was a randomized cluster (ring) vaccination study in which 3,537 contacts and contacts of contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed EVD received either “immediate” or 21-day “delayed” vaccination with Ervebo. This noteworthy design was intended to capture a social network of individuals and locations that might include dwellings or workplaces where a patient spent time while symptomatic, or the households of individuals who had contact with the patient during that person’s illness or death. In a comparison of cases of EVD among 2,108 individuals in the “immediate” vaccination arm and 1,429 individuals in the “delayed” vaccination arm, Ervebo was determined to be 100% effective in preventing Ebola cases with symptom onset greater than 10 days after vaccination. No cases of EVD with symptom onset greater than 10 days after vaccination were observed in the “immediate” cluster group, compared with 10 cases of EVD in the 21-day “delayed” cluster group. In additional studies, antibody responses to Ervebo were assessed in 477 individuals in Liberia, approximately 500 individuals in Sierra Leone and approximately 900 individuals in Canada, Spain and the U.S. The antibody responses among those in the study conducted in Canada, Spain and the U.S. were similar to those among individuals in the studies conducted in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The safety of Ervebo was assessed in approximately 15,000 individuals in Africa, Europe and North America. The most commonly reported side effects were pain, swelling and redness at the injection site, as well as headache, fever, joint and muscle aches and fatigue. Ervebo is administered as a single-dose injection, and is a live, attenuated vaccine that has been genetically engineered to contain a protein from the Zaire ebolavirus. The FDA granted this application under a program intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases. The FDA also granted for Ervebo to facilitate the development and scientific evaluation of the vaccine. Because of the public health importance of a vaccine to prevent EVD, the FDA worked closely with the company and completed its evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of Ervebo in less than six months. The approval was granted to Merck & Co., Inc.

{"title": "Statement on National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on framing opioid prescribing guidelines for acute pain", "date": "December 19, 2019", "contents": " , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration contracted the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to help advance the development of evidence-based guidelines for opioid analgesic prescribing for acute pain resulting from specific conditions or procedures. NASEM was tasked with providing a framework to evaluate current and future opioid prescribing to support a clinical practice guideline and to identify gaps in the evidence where future research is needed. We greatly appreciate all the work done by NASEM to produce released today. We recognize the critical role that health care providers play in addressing the opioid crisis – both in reducing the rate of new addiction by decreasing unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to opioid analgesics, while still providing appropriate pain treatment to patients who have medical needs for these medicines. However, there are still too many prescriptions written for opioid analgesics for durations of use longer than are appropriate for the medical need being addressed. The FDA’s efforts to address the opioid crisis must focus on encouraging “right size” prescribing of opioid pain medication as well as reducing the number of people unnecessarily exposed to opioids, while ensuring appropriate access to address the medical needs of patients experiencing pain severe enough to warrant treatment with opioids. That’s why it’s important that we re-examine how opioid analgesics are being prescribed and help to ensure that health care providers – who are the gatekeepers to prescription opioid analgesics – are provided with the most current and comprehensive guidance on the appropriate management of pain. One of the ways we believe we can work together with medical professional societies is by developing a framework that can assist them in creating and evaluating evidence-based guidelines on appropriate opioid analgesic prescribing to treat acute pain caused by specific medical conditions and common surgical procedures for which these drugs are prescribed. As part of their work, NASEM examined existing opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines, identified where there were gaps in evidence and outlined the type of research that will be needed to fill these gaps. NASEM also held a series of meetings and public workshops to engage a broad range of stakeholders who contributed expert knowledge on existing guidelines and provided emerging evidence or identified specific policy issues related to the development and availability of opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines based on their specialties. Moving forward, the FDA will consider the recommendations included in the consensus report as the agency works to implement the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ( ) provision that requires the development of evidence-based opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines for the indication-specific treatment of acute pain for the relevant therapeutic areas where such guidelines do not exist. The FDA remains committed to addressing this national crisis on all fronts, with a continued focus on decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies; and taking action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioid products.

{"title": "FDA, DEA seize 44 websites advertising sale of illicit THC vaping cartridges to US consumers as part of Operation Vapor Lock", "date": "December 20, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced today that they have seized 44 websites advertising the sale of illicit vaping cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The action, which is part of Operation Vapor Lock, reflects ongoing work by federal, state and local authorities to investigate the supply chain of vaping products associated with recent lung injuries. The online networks, some of which were identified based on interviews with patients and families, were advertising THC vaping cartridges in various brand names alongside pictures and statements about THC levels or other information clearly indicating the items for sale would be considered a controlled substance under federal law. To date, none of the products advertised on the 44 websites have been confirmed to be linked to any cases of lung injury. Nonetheless, the FDA and DEA took action to seize these sites, which were advertising THC vaping products for sale over the internet in clear violation of federal law. The seizure of the websites comes as the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other state and local health partners work to investigate lung injuries and deaths associated with the use of vaping products. FDA, CDC and state health authorities have made progress in identifying substances of concern; however, there are many different substances and product sources that remain under investigation, and there may be more than one cause. The latest national and state patient reports and product sample testing suggest THC-containing vaping products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers, are linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the incidents. “We need to fully understand the causes of vaping related lung injuries,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Moreover, it is a federal crime to advertise the sale of illicit THC vaping cartridges online, and by seizing these websites today, we are able to focus on other online and in-person sources of illegal and potentially dangerous vaping products. As more information comes to light in this complex and evolving investigation, we remain committed to taking further appropriate actions with our federal, state and local partners.” “In the wake of recent injuries and deaths caused by vaping products, these seizures send a message to anyone seeking to capitalize on this dangerous trend,” said Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon. “DEA will continue to work in lockstep with FDA and other federal, state, and local partners to use all our authorities to pursue anyone that violates our laws and puts Americans in harm’s way.” The websites that were seized directed people to order illicit THC vaping cartridges and make payments for orders through various financial services. Some of the websites seized were determined to exist solely to fraudulently obtain payments from people without ever intending to mail any product. For all of the other websites seized, investigators were able to complete a purchasing transaction for illicit THC vaping cartridges, but to date have not received any of the product ordered. In addition to health risks of illicit substances or illegal drugs purchased online, “scam” websites such as these pose other risks to consumers, including credit card fraud, identity theft and exposure to computer viruses. The FDA encourages consumers to report suspected criminal activity to the Shortly after the emergence of the lung injuries associated with vaping products, the FDA’s law enforcement arm began investigative efforts to identify particular products, constituents or compounds that may be at issue and the related supply chain. The agency’s Office of Criminal Investigations is following every possible lead, which includes traveling throughout the country and attempting to gather any available evidence and conduct interviews. The FDA is not pursuing any enforcement actions associated with personal use of any vaping products; the agency’s interest is in suppliers. To date, FDA laboratories have received over 1,200 samples from 31 states and one territory with roughly 1,004 of these samples connected to patients. These samples have been collected directly from consumers, hospitals, and state offices. They have included vaping devices and products containing varied levels of liquid as well as packaging and other documentation. The FDA laboratories are analyzing samples for the presence of a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids, along with cutting agents/diluents and other additives, pesticides, opioids, poisons, heavy metals and toxins. No one substance has been identified in all of the samples tested.

Outsourcing facilities, a significant part of the industry producing compounded drugs used by hospitals, clinics, providers, and other health care systems, have rapidly evolved since the passage of the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) in 2013. Although compounded drugs can fill an important role for patients and the FDA recognizes the need to preserve access to these products, they may also present a greater risk to patients because, among other things, they are not required to undergo the agency’s premarket review for safety, effectiveness and quality. These risks have become evident during inspections of outsourcing facilities when the agency has found concerning production practices that have resulted in recalls of compounded drug products and enforcement action against some firms. To help mitigate such issues, the FDA has been working to develop novel approaches to engage . To this end, today, the agency is announcing the – an initiative designed to enhance collaboration among and provide educational programs for outsourcing facilities aimed at improving the overall quality of compounded medicines. “By providing comprehensive, accessible learning tools, we will support outsourcing facilities in reliably producing high-quality compounded products that meet FDA’s standards. While engagement is voluntary, this initiative will provide an increased awareness and understanding of common issues and provide innovative ways to address challenges outsourcing facilities may face,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The FDA looks forward to ongoing engagement with outsourcing facilities.” The Center of Excellence, supported by a contract awarded by the FDA to Deloitte, will have three main areas of focus: in-person and online education and trainings; a conference to give outsourcing facilities, stakeholders and the agency the opportunity to exchange ideas and best practices; and market research to help inform the agency on key issues faced by outsourcing facilities. The in-person trainings will target registered outsourcing facilities and, as space allows, pharmacies that are considering becoming outsourcing facilities, by focusing on key aspects of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) and FDA policies. Registration is now open for the March courses with additional courses scheduled throughout 2020. Participants will have the opportunity to earn continuing education credits while enhancing their understanding of necessary procedures and guidelines. Topics for the in-person trainings will include sterile compounding, environmental monitoring, investigating quality issues, initiating corrective and preventive actions and proper cleanroom design and practices. Portions of this training will be in a laboratory environment to enhance hands-on learning. These trainings will be offered in small settings with free registration for outsourcing facility personnel to encourage participation. The online education programs will also focus on key aspects of CGMP, as well as other facets of drug compounding. These courses will be free for participants and will provide continuing education credits. As part of this new initiative, the FDA will also host a Center of Excellence conference in September 2020 in Dallas, Texas that will provide a forum for outsourcing facilities and related stakeholders to offer their feedback on policies and regulatory issues. Market research will be another key area of the Center of Excellence’s work as it gets underway. With this information, the agency can better understand the possible barriers and opportunities outsourcing facilities may encounter in several areas such as: business growth and viability, adhering to CGMP regulations and interactions with the FDA. This research will provide a better analysis of the outsourcing facility sector, so the agency can further enhance the Center of Excellence to make it as valuable as possible for all stakeholders. Through its training, collaboration and stakeholder engagement, the Center of Excellence will help support outsourcing facilities’ efforts to meet quality standards with the hope of reducing risks these products may pose to the public health.

Plaisier, FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. “All companies must follow the appropriate standards and are given the opportunity to ensure their actions are in accordance with these laws. We will continue to prevent the distribution of products that do not comply with applicable FDA requirements and ultimately place the public health at risk.” Basic Reset and Biogenyx have not received the FDA’s approval for the sale of their drugs and one device,  despite the companies’ claims that these products can be used to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent conditions such as inflammation, chronic diarrhea, bacterial infections, head lice, allergies and pain. Consumer use of an unapproved product that claims to treat diseases may cause them to delay seeking appropriate medical care. Additionally, unapproved products have not been reviewed by the FDA for quality, safety or effectiveness. Basic Reset and Biogenyx also unlawfully distributed dietary supplements that are adulterated and misbranded. This action follows multiple FDA inspections conducted at Basic Reset and Biogenyx between 2012 and 2017 and a 2016 . Despite assurances that the violations noted in the warning letter would be corrected, follow-up inspections revealed that the companies failed to make the necessary corrections. Basic Reset, Biogenyx and the other defendants cannot receive, label, hold or distribute dietary supplements, drugs or devices until they take certain steps to ensure that all of these products comply with the law. Operations can only resume after receiving written permission from the FDA. The FDA has not received any adverse event reports related to these products.

{"title": "FDA issues warning letter for not including the most serious risks in advertisement for medication-assisted treatment drug", "date": "December 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today posted a to Alkermes, Inc. of Massachusetts, for misbranding the drug Vivitrol (an extended-release injection formulation of naltrexone) by omitting warnings about the most serious risks associated with the drug from promotional materials. Vivitrol is approved for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification and should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. Known as medication-assisted treatment, the use of medications like Vivitrol, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, is effective in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and can help some people to sustain recovery. The warning letter was issued in relation to a print advertisement about Vivitrol. While the print advertisement contains claims and representations about the drug’s benefits, it fails to adequately communicate important warnings and precautions listed in the product labeling, including vulnerability to opioid overdose, a potentially fatal risk. “One way the FDA protects the public health is by ensuring that prescription drug information disseminated by drug sponsors is truthful, balanced and accurately communicated. We do this by reviewing prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in these promotional materials is not false or misleading,” said Thomas Abrams, director of the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Vivitrol is being promoted in a way that does not adequately present important risk information in a truthful and non-misleading manner. This is concerning from a public health perspective because of the potential for fatal opioid overdose in this vulnerable patient population.” The FDA is requesting the company immediately cease advertising practices that misbrand Vivitrol. In addition, because the violations described in the warning letter are serious, the FDA is also requesting the company include a comprehensive plan of action to disseminate truthful, non-misleading and complete corrective messages about the issues discussed in this letter to the audience(s) that received the violative promotional materials. Specifically, the labeling states that after opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. For approximately 28 days after administration, Vivitrol is designed to block the effect (known as blockade) of an opioid. As the blockade wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with Vivitrol may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used. Therefore, if a patient uses opioids at the same dose they previously used, after taking Vivitrol and as the blockade wanes or after missing a dose or discontinuing treatment, it could result in an opioid overdose. There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with Vivitrol could overcome the opioid blockade effect of Vivitrol. The print advertisement about Vivitrol also omits other important warnings and precautions including the risk of injection site reactions and other common adverse reactions associated with the use of drug. The FDA has requested that Alkermes, Inc. provide a written response to the warning letter to the FDA by Dec. 16. The warning letter posted today reflects the agency’s commitment to protect the public health by ensuring that prescription drug information is truthful, balanced and accurately communicated as well as the agency’s focus on addressing the opioid crisis, which remains one of the FDA’s top public health priorities. The FDA continues to look at ways to facilitate treatment options to address OUD as a chronic disease with long-lasting effects. There are three drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence: buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. All three of these treatments have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in combination with counseling and psychosocial support. Health care professionals and consumers should report any adverse events related to these and other drugs to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. To file a report, use the .

{"title": "FDA authorizes marketing of diagnostic test that uses novel technology to detect MRSA bacteria", "date": "December 05, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new diagnostic test based on bacterial viability and novel technology to detect Methicillin-resistant (MRSA) bacterial colonization, a widespread cause of hospital-acquired infections. The cobas vivoDx MRSA diagnostic test may allow health care professionals to evaluate patients for colonization with MRSA bacteria more quickly than traditional culture-based techniques when such testing is needed. “Diagnostics that are able to provide accurate results more quickly can offer health care providers an advantage when trying to prevent and contain the spread of resistant bacteria,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s authorization adds a new tool in the fight to prevent and control MRSA in high-risk settings. The FDA remains committed to supporting efforts to address antimicrobial resistance in order to better protect patients against this ongoing public health challenge.” MRSA is a type of bacteria that can lead to serious illness, and even death, if a patient develops an infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 5% of U.S. the MRSA bacteria, although many of those that carry the bacteria do not develop infections. MRSA has been defined as a serious antimicrobial resistant threat by the CDC. It is resistant to many common antibiotics, which means that if infections develop they can be very challenging to treat and control. The use of active screening to detect MRSA colonization and enable implementation of infection control measures has played an important role in reducing the rates of MRSA infection. The CDC that there were more than 323,000 MRSA cases in hospitalized patients in the U.S. and more than 10,000 deaths in 2017. The cobas vivoDx MRSA test uses a new bacteriophage technology based on bioluminescence to detect MRSA from nasal swab samples in as little as 5 hours compared to 24-48 hours for conventional culture. Diagnostic tests that can more quickly and easily detect MRSA could benefit patient care and may help healthcare providers prevent the spread of MRSA. The FDA reviewed data from performance studies in which the cobas vivoDx MRSA test correctly identified MRSA in approximately 90% of samples where MRSA was present and correctly identified no MRSA in 98.6% of samples that did not have MRSA present. The cobas vivoDx MRSA test authorized today is intended to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings and can be used to identify patients needing enhanced precautions for infection control such as isolation and additional decolonization efforts. The FDA reviewed the cobas vivoDx MRSA test through the pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for tests of this type, including requirements relating to labeling and design verification and validation to address certain risks, such as false positives.  When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the cobas vivoDx MRSA test to Roche Molecular Systems Inc.

{"title": "FDA approves first generics of Gilenya", "date": "December 05, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three applications for first generics of Gilenya (fingolimod) capsules for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adult patients. “Approving safe and effective generics so patients have more treatment options continues to be a priority for the FDA,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Having access to affordable treatments is important for patients with conditions that require ongoing care. The FDA has a longstanding commitment to increasing patient access to lower-cost, high-quality generic medicines.” MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body. It is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than men. For most people with MS, episodes of worsening function and appearance of new symptoms, called relapses or flare-ups, are initially followed by recovery periods (remissions). Over time, recovery may be incomplete, leading to progressive decline in function and increased disability. Gilenya is a widely used orally administered treatment option. The most common side effects reported in the clinical trials for Gilenya include headache, elevation of liver enzymes, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain and pain in the extremities. Fingolimod must be dispensed with a Medication Guide that contains important information about its uses and risks. Serious risks include slowing of the heart rate, especially after the first dose. Fingolimod may increase the risk of serious infections. Patients should be monitored for infection during treatment and for two months after discontinuation of treatment. A rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability, called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients being treated with the drug. PML cases usually occur in patients with weakened immune systems. Fingolimod can cause vision problems. It may increase the risk for swelling and narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Other serious risks include respiratory problems, liver injury, increased blood pressure and skin cancer. Fingolimod may cause harm to a developing fetus; health care professionals should advise women of child-bearing age of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. The FDA granted approvals of generic fingolimod applications to HEC Pharm Co. Limited, Biocon Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. Addressing the challenges related to developing generics and promoting more generic competition is a key part of the FDA’s and the agency’s efforts to help increase patient access to more affordable medicines.

{"title": "Statement from Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, on impurities found in diabetes drugs outside the U.S.", "date": "December 05, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been investigating the presence of genotoxic impurities, called nitrosamines, in some types of drugs. Over the past year and a half, several drug products including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and ranitidine, commonly known as Zantac, have been found to contain small amounts of nitrosamines such as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). During this time, there has been an ongoing investigation into the presence of nitrosamines in other drug products. This effort is focused on ensuring the drugs used by Americans continue to meet strict quality standards. The FDA is aware that some metformin diabetes medicines in other countries were reported to have low levels of NDMA. Based on the information we have available, the levels of NDMA seen outside the U.S. are within the range that is naturally occurring in some foods and in water. While we are aware that some regulatory agencies outside the U.S. may be recalling some metformin drugs, there are no metformin recalls affecting the U.S. market at this time. The FDA is investigating whether metformin in the U.S. market contains NDMA, and whether it is above the acceptable daily intake limit of 96 nanograms. The agency will also work with companies to test samples of metformin sold in the U.S. and will recommend recalls as appropriate if high levels of NDMA are found. If as part of our investigation, metformin drugs are recalled, the FDA will provide timely updates to patients and health care professionals. Metformin is a prescription drug used to control high blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients should continue taking metformin to keep their diabetes under control. It could be dangerous for patients with this serious condition to stop taking their metformin without first talking to their health care professional. The FDA recommends prescribers continue to use metformin when clinically appropriate, as the FDA investigation is still ongoing, and there are no alternative medications that treat this condition in the same way. NDMA is a common contaminant found in water and foods including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. Everyone is exposed to some level of NDMA. The FDA and the international scientific community do not expect it to cause harm when ingested at low levels. The acceptable daily intake limit for NDMA in the U.S. is 96 nanograms. Genotoxic substances such as NDMA may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels and over long periods of time, but a person taking a drug that contains NDMA at-or-below the acceptable daily intake limit every day for 70 years is not expected to have an increased risk of cancer. Today, we have better testing methods than ever before, and we know what to look for in products’ chemical structure and manufacturing processes that may increase the risk of forming low levels of nitrosamines. Improved technology enables us to detect even trace amounts of impurities in drug products and may be the reason why more products have been found to have low levels of NDMA. The agency has strict standards for safety, effectiveness and quality, and our staff makes every effort to help keep the U.S. drug supply as safe as possible. We also work closely with international drug regulatory agencies so that we leverage resources and testing done outside the U.S. which can help inform testing of the U.S. drug supply. As our investigations and testing continues, along with the investigations done by other drug regulatory agencies, we may find low levels of nitrosamines in additional drugs. The FDA will continue to investigate the source of these impurities, but it is important to note that there are multiple reasons why NDMA can be present in drugs. Previously, we found the source of NDMA can be related to the drug’s manufacturing process or its chemical structure or even the conditions in which they are stored or packaged. As food and drugs are processed in the body, nitrosamines, including NDMA, can be formed. The FDA continues to test and research possible sources for the several drugs found to contain NDMA. We are taking a systematic approach to identify medicines with nitrosamines above acceptable daily intake limits and remove them from the market. For example, yesterday we expanded testing requirements for ranitidine manufacturers to help give consumers confidence that the drugs on the market do not have NDMA above the acceptable daily intake limit. Our investigations, including our current investigation of metformin, take into account the medical necessity of the drug, how many Americans may take it, and whether there may be alternative treatments available. The American public can expect that we will act quickly to address any issue as soon as we find out about it. These investigations take time. We understand that these issues affect patients’ health and well-being in many ways, and the FDA’s goal is to provide patients and health care providers as much clarity and as many answers as possible to inform their health care decisions. The FDA will communicate any information we have scientifically confirmed to ensure the public knows as much as possible as soon as possible. Protecting patients is the FDA’s highest priority, and Americans can be confident in the quality of the products the agency approves. We are patients too, and we’re committed to maintaining our high standards for quality, safety and efficacy for all drugs we, our families, friends, colleagues and millions of fellow Americans rely on for their health.

{"title": "FDA sends warning to companies for offering unapproved umbilical cord blood products that may put patients at risk", "date": "December 06, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has , of Yorba Linda, California, and their presidents and chief executive officers, Roya Panah and John W. Kosolcharoen, for processing and distributing unapproved products derived from umbilical cord blood. They have also been warned regarding significant deviations from current good tissue practice (CGTP) and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, including deficient donor eligibility practices, inadequate aseptic practices to prevent contamination and deficient environmental monitoring. These deviations create potential significant safety concerns that put patients at risk. The companies’ unapproved products derived from umbilical cord blood are PURE and PURE PRO. In addition to the warning letter issued to Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC earlier this month, the FDA sent untitled letters to , Inc., and for offering unapproved stem cell products to patients. The agency also recently sent 20 letters to manufacturers and health care providers noting that it has come to our attention that they may be offering unapproved stem cell products, reiterating the FDA’s compliance and enforcement policy. “The FDA’s mission includes protecting public health by helping to ensure the safety and efficacy of medical products that patients rely on. The agency is aware that there are establishments who prey upon vulnerable populations by commercially marketing stem cell products with false and misleading claims about their effectiveness for treating serious diseases,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The FDA is taking this action today because Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC failed to take appropriate measures to protect patient safety. As evidenced by the number of actions that the agency has taken this month alone, there are still many companies that have failed to come into compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations during the period in which the agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain products with respect to FDA’s investigational new drug and premarket approval requirements, when the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns. This period, which ends in November 2020, has allowed product manufacturers time to engage with the FDA to determine if they need to submit a marketing authorization application and, if so, seek guidance on how to submit their application to the FDA for approval. The agency continues to urge these manufacturers to engage with the agency about their regulatory requirements in the coming months.” An FDA inspection of the Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC facility in May revealed the companies were processing and distributing products derived from human umbilical cord blood for use in patients who were unrelated to the donors. Because these products are not intended for homologous use only (i.e., to perform the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor) and fail to meet other criteria set forth in , they are regulated as both drugs and biological products. Therefore, to lawfully market these products, an approved biologics license application is needed. While in the development stage, the products may be used in humans only if an investigational new drug application (IND) is in effect. However, no such licenses or INDs exist for the PURE and PURE PRO products marketed by Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC. During the inspection, the FDA documented evidence of significant deviations from CGTP and CGMP requirements in the manufacture of the PURE and PURE PRO products, including deficient donor eligibility practices, such as failing to screen donors’ relevant medical records for risk factors for communicable diseases; inadequate aseptic practices, such as failing to follow procedures to prevent microbiological contamination; and deficient environmental monitoring, such as failing to establish a system for cleaning and disinfecting the processing room and equipment. These deviations pose a significant risk that the products may be contaminated with viruses or other microorganisms or have other serious product quality defects, which could potentially lead to patient harm. In addition to the warning letter released today, the FDA has issued a about exosome products. Certain clincs across the country, including some that also manufacture or market violative “stem cell” products, are now also offering exosome products to patients. FDA’s safety alert informs the public, especially patients, health care practitioners and clinics, of multiple recent reports of serious adverse events experienced by patients in Nebraska who were treated with unapproved products marketed as containing exosomes. These reports were brought to the FDA’s attention by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others, and the agencies worked with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is carefully assessing this situation along with our federal and state partners. As highlighted in 2017 with the release of the FDA’s , including the FDA’s final guidance ( ), the FDA is applying a risk-based approach to compliance and enforcement of cell-based regenerative medicine products, taking into account how products are being administered as well as the diseases and conditions for which they are intended to be used. The agency noted that it intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain products until November 2020 with respect to the FDA’s IND application and premarket approval requirements when the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns. However, the FDA does not intend to exercise such enforcement discretion for those products that pose a reported safety concern or a potential significant safety concern to patients. As reflected by this warning letter and other correspondence issued by the agency, the FDA will continue to take appropriate steps to protect the public health. The FDA continues to facilitate the development of safe and effective cellular therapies and offers opportunities for engagement between potential manufacturers and the agency, such as through the program. The agency also encourages the use of its expedited programs whenever applicable, in addition to a of products with industry and the agency. In addition, the a temporary program called the Tissue Reference Group (TRG) Rapid Inquiry Program (TRIP), which is intended to assist manufacturers of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products (including stem cells) to obtain a rapid, preliminary, informal, non-binding assessment from the agency regarding how their specific products are regulated. The FDA requested a response from Liveyon Labs and Liveyon LLC within 15 working days of the letter’s issuance that details how the deviations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Deviations not corrected by the companies and responsible individuals could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction or prosecution.

These attacks occur suddenly and can produce permanent neurological damage and death,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Prior to today’s approval, treatment options have only provided partial relief from the intense unremitting pain that characterizes these attacks. The drug approved today can treat this disease by helping to reduce the number of attacks that disrupt the lives of patients.” The approval of Givlaari was based on the results of a clinical trial of 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria. Patients received a placebo or Givlaari. Givlaari’s performance was measured by the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent health care visits or intravenous infusion of hemin at home. Patients who received Givlaari experienced 70% fewer porphyria attacks compared to patients receiving a placebo. Common side effects for patients taking Givlaari were nausea and injection site reactions. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients for anaphylactic (allergic) reaction and renal (kidney) function.

{"title": "FDA approves system for the delivery of ear tubes under local anesthesia to treat ear infection", "date": "November 25, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved a new system for the delivery of tympanostomy tubes, commonly referred to as ear tubes, that can be inserted into the eardrum to treat recurrent ear infections (i.e., otitis media). The Tubes Under Local Anesthesia (Tula) System is the first ear tube delivery system that can be performed in young children using local anesthesia in a physician’s office setting. The Tula System consists of the anesthetic Tymbion, Tusker Medical tympanostomy tubes, and several devices needed for the delivery of the ear tubes and the anesthetic into the ear drum. “Today’s approval offers patients an option for the treatment of recurrent ear infections that does not require general anesthesia. As millions of children suffer from ear infections every year, it is important to have safe and effective treatments available to this susceptible patient population,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This approval has the potential to expand patient access to a treatment that can be administered in a physician’s office with local anesthesia and minimal discomfort.” Ear infections are common in children, with the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) estimating that 5 of 6 children will have at least one ear infection before their third birthday. While health care professionals frequently prescribe antibiotics as a treatment, if antibiotics fail to treat an ear infection, or if infections continue to occur, a doctor may recommend a surgical procedure to place a small tube in the eardrum. In young children, the delivery of an ear tube has traditionally been performed in a hospital setting or surgery center and required the patient to receive general anesthesia. The Tula System enables the delivery of an ear tube to patients under local anesthesia in a physician’s office setting, therefore avoiding the administration of general anesthesia. The Tula System uses a small electrical current to deliver a local anesthetic into the ear drum prior to tube insertion. It is approved for use in both adults and children as young as six months of age. The FDA evaluated data provided by the sponsor from 222 pediatric patients to assess the effectiveness of the Tula System for the delivery of ear tubes. The procedural success rate was 86% and 89% in children younger than age 5 and between ages 5-12 years old, respectively. The most common adverse event observed was inadequate anesthesia during the procedure. The Tula System should not be used in patients younger than six months of age or patients who have allergies to some local anesthetics. This product is not intended for patients who may have pre-existing issues with their eardrum, such as a perforated eardrum. The Tula System was granted designation, meaning the FDA provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the product. To qualify for such designation, a device must be intended to treat or diagnose a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition and meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients.

{"title": "FDA warns 15 companies for illegally selling various products containing cannabidiol as agency details safety concerns", "date": "November 25, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to 15 companies for illegally selling products containing cannabidiol (CBD) in ways that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The FDA also published a detailing safety concerns about CBD products more broadly. Based on the lack of scientific information supporting the safety of CBD in food, the FDA is also indicating today that it cannot conclude that CBD is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts for its use in human or animal food. Today’s actions come as the FDA continues to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. This includes ongoing work to obtain and evaluate information to address outstanding questions related to the safety of CBD products, while maintaining the agency’s rigorous public health standards. The FDA plans to provide an update on its progress regarding the agency’s approach to these products in the coming weeks. “As we work quickly to further clarify our regulatory approach for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds like CBD, we’ll continue to monitor the marketplace and take action as needed against companies that violate the law in ways that raise a variety of public health concerns. In line with our mission to protect the public, foster innovation, and promote consumer confidence, this overarching approach regarding CBD is the same as the FDA would take for any other substance that we regulate,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “We remain concerned that some people wrongly think that the myriad of CBD products on the market, many of which are illegal, have been evaluated by the FDA and determined to be safe, or that trying CBD ‘can’t hurt.’ Aside from one prescription drug approved to treat two pediatric epilepsy disorders, these products have not been approved by the FDA and we want to be clear that a number of questions remain regarding CBD’s safety – including reports of products containing contaminants, such as pesticides and heavy metals – and there are real risks that need to be considered. We recognize the significant public interest in CBD and we must work together with stakeholders and industry to fill in the knowledge gaps about the science, safety and quality of many of these products.” Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. The revised outlines specific safety concerns related to CBD products, including potential liver injury, interactions with other drugs, drowsiness, diarrhea, and changes in mood. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels and impair sexual behavior in males. Questions also remain about cumulative use of CBD and about CBD’s impacts on vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. CBD is marketed in a variety of product types, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, food products such as chocolate bars and teas, and topical lotions and creams. As outlined in the warning letters issued today, these particular companies are using product webpages, online stores and social media to market CBD products in interstate commerce in ways that violate the FD&C Act, including marketing CBD products to treat diseases or for other therapeutic uses for humans and/or animals. Other violations include marketing CBD products as dietary supplements and adding CBD to human and animal foods. The companies receiving warning letters are: The FDA has previously sent to other companies illegally selling CBD products in interstate commerce that claimed to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat or cure serious diseases, such as cancer, or otherwise violated the FD&C Act. Some of these products were in further violation because CBD was added to food, and some of the products were also marketed as dietary supplements despite products which contain CBD not meeting the definition of a dietary supplement. Under the FD&C Act, any product intended to treat a disease or otherwise have a therapeutic or medical use, and any product (other than a food) that is intended to affect the structure or function of the body of humans or animals, is a drug. The FDA has not approved any CBD products other than to treat rare, severe forms of epilepsy. There is very limited information for other marketed CBD products, which likely differ in composition from the FDA-approved product and have not been evaluated for potential adverse effects on the body. Unlike drugs approved by the FDA, there has been no FDA evaluation of whether these unapproved products are effective for their intended use, what the proper dosage might be, how they could interact with FDA-approved drugs, or whether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns. In addition, the manufacturing process of unapproved CBD drug products has not been subject to FDA review as part of the human or animal drug approval processes. Consumers may also put off getting important medical care, such as proper diagnosis, treatment and supportive care due to unsubstantiated claims associated with CBD products. For that reason, it’s important that consumers talk to a health care professional about the best way to treat diseases or conditions with existing, approved treatment options. Additionally, some of the products outlined in the warning letters issued today raise other legal and public health concerns: The FDA has requested responses from the companies within 15 working days stating how the companies will correct the violations. Failure to correct the violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and/or injunction. The FDA encourages human and animal health care professionals and consumers to report adverse reactions associated with these or similar products to the agency’s The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Some of the products are foods to which CBD has been added. Under the FD&C Act, it is illegal to introduce into interstate commerce any human or animal food to which certain drug ingredients, such as CBD, have been added. In addition, the FDA is not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS among qualified experts for its use in human or animal food. There also is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD as an ingredient in human food or animal food, and the agency is not aware of any other exemption from the food additive definition that would apply to CBD. CBD is therefore an unapproved food additive, and its use in human or animal food violates the FD&C Act for reasons that are independent of its status as a drug ingredient. Some of the products are marketed as dietary supplements. However, CBD products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act. One product outlined in a warning letter to Apex Hemp Oil LLC is intended for food-producing animals. The agency remains concerned about the safety of human food products (e.g. meat, milk, and eggs) from animals that consume CBD, as there is a lack of data establishing safe CBD residue levels."},

This action follows several inspections conducted by the FDA, which found Listeria monocytogenes ( ) in the company’s food preparation area and that the company was holding food for distribution in insanitary conditions. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for the Northern District of California entered a consent decree of permanent injunction on Nov. 22, 2019, between the U.S. and Golden Gate Soy Products Inc., and the company’s representatives, Yong Li Chen and Ling Hong Tang. Golden Gate Soy Products specializes in manufacturing a variety of tofu and soy-based products, including soy milk. “The FDA takes its role to protect our food supply very seriously. The inappropriate and unsafe practices of Golden Gate Soy Products not only violated the law, but also put consumers in harm’s way,” said FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Melinda K. Plaisier. “This type of behavior is unacceptable and is why we took action to prevent the defendants from introducing contaminated or potentially contaminated food products into the marketplace.” The consent decree prohibits the defendants from receiving, preparing, processing, packing, holding, labeling and/or distributing foods at or from their facility, or any other facility, until certain requirements are met. If the defendants choose to resume operations, the consent decree requires them to notify the FDA and take corrective actions before resuming operations. is a species of disease-causing bacteria.

This infection can have serious adverse effects for consumers, particularly women who are or may become pregnant, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. According to the complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the agency, the FDA inspected the facility several times since 2017 and found in the facility during two separate inspections. The inspections also documented multiple violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act where the defendants were processing food under insanitary conditions. The FDA issued the defendants inspection observations noting the violations during each inspection through the use of FDA Form 483s. On Mar. 5, 2019, the defendants responded to the FDA in writing with promised corrective actions. However, the FDA’s follow up inspection found that none of these promised actions were adequate, resulting in today’s injunction. The FDA is not aware of any confirmed illnesses related to these products.

{"title": "FDA launches app for health care professionals to report novel uses of existing medicines for patients with difficult-to-treat infectious diseases", "date": "December 05, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the global launch of , an internet-based repository that will allow the clinical community to report their experiences treating difficult-to-treat infectious diseases with novel uses of existing FDA-approved drugs through a website, a smartphone or other mobile device. The platform enables the crowdsourcing of medical information from health care providers to guide potentially life-saving interventions and facilitate the development of new drugs for neglected diseases. The repository is a collaboration between the FDA and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). “The CURE ID application focuses on drugs for infectious diseases lacking adequate treatments, including neglected tropical diseases, emerging infectious threats and infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant organisms. When health care professionals directly input their clinical cases into the app, CURE ID allows these real-world experiences to be organized and analyzed much faster, making it easier to spot promising new uses for existing drugs,” said Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D., FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner. “Our hope is that this app will serve as a connector among major treatment centers, academics, private practitioners, government facilities and other health care professionals from around the world and ultimately get treatments to patients faster.” The repository captures clinical outcomes when drugs are used for new indications, in new populations, in new doses or in new combinations. Health care professionals generally may choose to prescribe or use a legally marketed human drug or medical device for an unapproved or uncleared use when they judge that the unapproved use is medically appropriate for an individual patient. The systematic collection of real-world experience in the app will help identify drug candidates for additional study, encourage further drug development, and may serve as a resource for practitioners making individual patient treatment decisions in the absence of established safe and effective options. Repurposing approved drugs for new clinical indications can potentially offer an efficient drug-development pathway for treatments of diseases and conditions that have few or no therapeutic options. “The potential importance of new therapeutic opportunities from repurposing drugs can’t be understated,” said NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, M.D. “The CURE ID platform exemplifies how collaborative efforts can spark innovations that benefit patients. This new platform harnesses the power of crowdsourcing to help gather medical observations in the field and help identify potentially effective treatments for diseases.” The app works by collecting a simple case report form from caregivers about their experience using an approved product for an unapproved use. Health care professionals can browse from a collection of cases that have already been documented, including successful and unsuccessful treatments, in addition to viewing relevant clinical trials and those open to enrollment at . App users can also participate in a treatment discussion forum where they can engage with fellow providers globally. The FDA plans to reach out to health care providers in various disciplines, including infectious and tropical diseases, to encourage them to use the app. The full launch of the app follows the release of several pilot versions after an initial innovation award was received from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services IDEA Lab in April 2015. During the pilots, extensive user-testing was conducted in India (2015 and 2017) and South Africa (2016). Additional feedback was also collected from users in the U.S., Europe and Peru. The updated app that launched today includes the addition of a newsfeed, an improved search feature with data from 325 different infectious diseases and syndromes to choose from, and the inclusion of nearly 1,500 initial cases from clinicians and the published literature and over 18,000 clinical trials.

Cruz, to immediately cease manufacturing due to significant violations of FDA regulations. An FDA inspection and subsequent record review revealed significant violations of regulations regarding donor eligibility determinations, including donor screening and testing. The clinic’s failure to fulfill these requirements puts patients at risk for exposure to communicable diseases, including HIV and hepatitis. “Patients use fertility clinics to help them become parents and they rely on these clinics to follow the appropriate regulatory requirements for screening and testing of donors of reproductive tissue. Patients should not have to worry about being at risk or becoming infected with a communicable disease when receiving reproductive tissues. In this case, the clinic’s actions put patients at risk and violated the FDA’s regulations, and we took this action to stop these potentially harmful practices,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “We will use the full scope of our authorities to take action, as appropriate, to protect the public from those who choose to disregard the rules and potentially cause harm.” The FDA issued this order upon finding that the establishment is in violation of FDA regulations that require certain protections to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). The FDA has also determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the HCT/Ps manufactured by the establishment pose a danger to health. The FDA’s inspection of the Gynecology, Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility Institute from August 26 to October 1 revealed that, among other violations, the clinic failed to test specimens from anonymous or directed donors of reproductive cells or tissue for relevant communicable disease agents—including HIV-1/2, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia—using appropriate FDA-licensed, approved or cleared donor screening tests. Additionally, the clinic failed to determine donor eligibility, based on the results of donor screening and donor testing, prior to implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of HCT/Ps. The clinic also failed to determine as ineligible donors who were identified as having a risk factor for or clinical evidence of any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases for which screening is required. Under the FDA’s regulations, the clinic is responsible for following designed to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. The Gynecology, Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility Institute clinic did not follow those requirements. Per the order issued by the agency, the clinic must immediately cease all manufacturing of HCT/Ps from directed or anonymous reproductive tissue donors, which includes any or all steps in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any human cell or tissue, and the screening or testing of cell or tissue donors. The order further requires the clinic to continue to store all HCT/Ps subject to the order, which are in their possession, or received after the date of the order. The clinic cannot resume operations until it achieves compliance with the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271 and receives written authorization from the FDA to resume operations. Additionally, the FDA has asked the clinic to immediately notify regarding the order any patients of the clinic since May 25, 2005, who were recipients of anonymous or directed donations of reproductive tissues (such as gestational carriers or surrogates); have offspring as the result of an assisted reproductive technology cycle with the clinic, involving an anonymous or directed reproductive tissue donor; or have stored tissues that involve anonymous or directed reproductive tissue donors. Patients of this clinic who have concerns should reach out to the clinic or their health care professional with questions about testing for any communicable disease. However, at this time, the FDA is not aware of any reports of transmission of communicable diseases from patients at this clinic. The FDA’s order to cease manufacturing HCT/Ps went in effect immediately upon being issued on November 25, although the agency has offered the clinic the opportunity for a regulatory hearing.

{"title": "Statement on concerns with medical device availability due to certain sterilization facility closures", "date": "October 25, 2019", "contents": " As the agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all medical devices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been closely monitoring the supply chain effects of closures and potential closures of certain large-scale sterilization facilities that use a gas called to sterilize medical devices prior to their use. The recent closure of a Sterigenics ethylene oxide sterilization facility in Illinois, the temporary closure of another Sterigenics facility in Georgia, and the potential closure of a large Becton Dickinson sterilization facility in Georgia could affect the availability of some sterile medical devices used by health care delivery organizations and patients. We have been working diligently with impacted device manufacturers and health care delivery organizations to ensure that they are aware of these developments and preparing to minimize adverse effects on patients whose care could be negatively affected if medical devices sterilized at these large facilities were not accessible. Medical devices that are sterilized to remove potentially harmful germs and other microorganisms prior to use are critical to our health care system and a shortage—especially of life-saving, life-sustaining, or other critical devices—can be a detriment to public health. In light of the possibility of continued ethylene oxide sterilization facility closures, we are again alerting the public to growing concerns about the future availability of sterile medical devices and impending medical device shortages. Although medical devices can be sterilized by several methods, ethylene oxide is the most common method of sterilization of medical devices in the U.S. and is a well-established and scientifically-proven method of preventing harmful microorganisms from reproducing and causing infections. More than 20 billion devices sold in the U.S. every year are sterilized with ethylene oxide, accounting for approximately 50 percent of devices that require sterilization. Medical devices made from certain polymers (such as plastic or resin), metals, or glass—or devices that have multiple layers of packaging or hard-to-reach crevices—are likely to be sterilized with ethylene oxide to avoid product damage during the process. These include surgical kits used in emergency procedures such as emergency Caesarean sections (“C-sections”) and in routine procedures such as cardiac surgery and hip or knee replacement surgeries. Without adequate availability of ethylene oxide sterilization, we anticipate a national shortage of these devices and other critical devices including feeding tube devices used in neonatal intensive care units, drug-eluting cardiac stents, catheters, shunts and other implantable devices. It’s important to note at this time there are no readily available processes or facilities that can serve as viable alternatives to those that use ethylene oxide to sterilize these devices. In short: this method is critical to our health care system and to the continued availability of safe, effective and high-quality medical devices. The FDA recognizes that there are concerns associated with release of ethylene oxide into the environment if emissions were to occur at unsafe levels. Concerns about ethylene oxide emissions have resulted in certain state actions against sterilization facilities that are currently impacting manufacturers’ ability to use the ethylene oxide process to sterilize their medical devices. In February, the FDA became aware that the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop Sterigenics from sterilizing medical products and other products with ethylene oxide at their Willowbrook, Illinois, facility. The state EPA order was due to the presence of levels of ethylene oxide higher than the EPA found to be acceptable in the air around the facility. This closure caused a temporary of pediatric breathing tubes. Another Sterigenics contract sterilization facility, in Atlanta, Georgia, has been closed since August while it undergoes construction to reduce ethylene oxide emissions. In October, the Sterigenics Willowbrook, Illinois, facility announced they would not reopen. As a consequence of these two large sterilization facilities being unavailable, the FDA continues to coordinate with multiple stakeholders on any impacts to medical device availability and to communicate with Sterigenics and medical device companies that may be affected. Because the number of ethylene oxide contract sterilization facilities in the U.S. is limited, we are very concerned that additional facility closures could severely impact the supply of sterile medical devices to health care delivery organizations that depend on those devices to take care of patients. The impact resulting from closure of these and perhaps more facilities will be difficult to reverse, and ultimately could result in years of spot or nationwide shortages of critical medical devices, which could compromise patient care. This is why today we are urging medical device manufacturers that use ethylene oxide facilities to assess their inventory for any potential downstream impacts of sterilization facility closures on their product distribution. We are committed to working with manufacturers to look for alternative sterilization options. When manufacturers keep the FDA apprised of progress and obstacles encountered, it helps ensure that everyone’s best efforts are being made to mitigate any shortages and prevent potential shortages. When U.S. manufacturers are not able to resolve a shortage and it involves a critical device needed for U.S. patients, the FDA may look for a firm that is willing and able to redirect safe and effective product into the U.S. market to address a shortage. We also encourage health care facilities to perform similar inventory assessments of critical medical supplies that undergo contract terminal sterilization via ethylene oxide prior to shipping and reach out to the FDA so we can assist in any way we can to help identify sources of potential substitute devices. Hospitals and other health care delivery organizations should also work with their purchasing departments, group purchasing organizations and distributors, as appropriate, to help obtain product needed for patient care. So as to not exacerbate anticipated product availability concerns, we urge facilities to work together and not hoard product or attempt to purchase larger quantities of devices beyond their normal purchase volume. We also encourage device manufacturers and health care providers to us with information on potential supply issues. We have a so that any user, patient, manufacturer, or organization within the supply chain that is aware of a delay in distribution of new product, and/or anticipates a shortage, can notify us. It’s never too early to contact us – the sooner we are aware of a potential shortage, the better we can assist in proactively developing a plan to mitigate its effects on patient care. Since we first became aware of this issue earlier this year, we have continued to focus intently on addressing the immediate impacts of these closures and potential closures to help ensure patients can have access to the safe, effective, and high-quality medical devices they need today. We continue to communicate directly with manufacturers and monitor the supply of devices sterilized in facilities that have closed or that may close, paying special attention to life-saving, life-sustaining, and other critical devices. For instance, in the case of Smiths Medical’s Bivona tracheostomy breathing tubes that were processed at the now-closed Sterigenics facility in Illinois, we helped mitigate that shortage by helping the manufacturer get a timely site change that kept supply interruptions to a minimum. We share the public’s objective to reduce over-reliance on ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. And therefore, in addition to our shortage mitigation efforts, we have also been addressing the broader need for innovation and improvements to medical device sterilization techniques in general. For example,  earlier this year we announced to encourage ideas from stakeholders, academics, industry and others about novel solutions for improving sterilization processes. This includes a call to identify new or alternative sterilization methods and technologies that are alternatives to those that use ethylene oxide, and another to develop new strategies to reduce ethylene oxide emissions. In addition, we’ve previously announced we’re holding a on November 6 and 7, 2019, dedicated to discussing how best to encourage innovation in medical device sterilization. We also continue to collaborate with the U.S. EPA, the entity responsible for reviewing and enforcing Clean Air Act regulations for sterilization facilities that emit ethylene oxide to ensure that facilities protect the public from significant risks, providing the U.S. EPA with updates on FDA activities in this area. And we’ll continue to update stakeholders and the public as new information becomes available. We want to be clear that we understand that there are very real consequences that medical device shortages have on patients, and we’re committed to doing everything in our authority to help mitigate the adverse patient impact these sterilization facility closures are expected to have. We’re also calling on all stakeholders—manufacturers, contract sterilizers, government agencies and other public health advocates—to join us and do your part to avert new device shortages and ensure patients have access to important and life-saving medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on FDA’s new report regarding root causes and potential solutions to drug shortages", "date": "October 29, 2019", "contents": " One of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s top priorities is to ensure that Americans have access to safe and effective medicines. Sometimes, for a number of reasons, of certain medicines occur and the FDA works immediately with our public health partners and industry to minimize their impact on patients and restore the availability of these drugs. A shortage of just one critical drug can have a major impact on a patient’s health, which underscores why government and industry need to act quickly to prevent future shortages. Despite public- and private-sector efforts to prevent and mitigate drug shortages, they continue to occur and persist. So, at the request of Congress last year, the FDA convened an inter-agency to study the problem, determine the root causes of drug shortages, and make recommendations for enduring solutions. This effort was designed to help address the number of drug shortages that we continue to experience, which place a serious burden on patients and providers who need access to these medically necessary products. To understand forces causing drug shortages, the Task Force commissioned a team of FDA economists and scientists to analyze drugs that went into shortage from 2013 to 2017. The agency also invited public participation by hosting a public meeting, opening a docket to receive public comments, and inviting stakeholders from industry, academia, and the medical provider and patient communities to a series of listening sessions to provide insight into the causes of drug shortages and identify potential solutions. Today, on behalf of the inter-agency Task Force, the FDA issued a report, “ ,” that attempts to identify root causes and offer recommendations for government and industry based on insights gleaned from stakeholders in the private and public sectors. These recommendations are intended to help prevent and mitigate future drug shortages. The report focuses on human drugs, but many of the same concerns apply to veterinary medicines used to treat service, companion, and food-producing animals. The Task Force found that the number of ongoing drug shortages has been rising, and that their impact is likely underappreciated. The Task Force analyzed 163 drugs that went into shortage from 2013 to 2017 and compared these medicines to similar drugs that did not go into shortage. Shortage drugs were more likely to be relatively low-price and financially unattractive drugs and were more likely to be sterile injectables. Shortages often occurred as a result of disruption in supply due to a variety of factors. Importantly, prices rarely rose after shortages began, and during shortages, production typically did not increase enough to restore supply to pre-shortage levels. Many manufacturers reported discontinuing the production of drugs before a shortage for commercial reasons (e.g., loss of profitability). These results suggest a broken marketplace, where scarcity of drugs in shortage or at risk for shortage does not result in the price increases predicted by basic economic principles. While there are no easy solutions to the problems identified, and there is no single cause of drug shortages, the Task Force offers three key recommendations to address the root causes of shortages. First, we recommend taking steps to increase understanding of the impacts of drug shortages and companies’ contracting practices that may contribute to them. Currently, there is little private- or public-sector effort to collect and analyze comprehensive information to characterize shortages, quantify their effects, or closely observe the contracting practices that may be driving them. This information would help improve stakeholders’ understanding of the impact shortages have on the Nation’s health care and support private- and public-sector strategies to prevent or mitigate them in the future. Our report encourages more systematic and transparent study of current contracting practices to support development of model contracts designed to promote reliable access to safe, effective, and affordable drugs. Second, we support the idea of developing a system to measure and rate a facility’s quality management maturity. The rating would evaluate the robustness of a manufacturing facility’s quality system and its ability to deliver high-quality products reliably and without disruption. Historically, many pharmaceutical manufacturing firms have focused their efforts on compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), which set a minimum threshold that companies must achieve to be allowed to supply the U.S. marketplace. They do not include more advanced levels of quality management. As outlined in an , a rating system could be used to inform purchasers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs), and consumers about the state of, and commitment to, the quality management maturity of the manufacturing facility making the drugs they are buying. This effort would introduce transparency into the market, and provide companies committed to quality management maturity with a competitive advantage, potentially enabling them to obtain sustainable prices as well as grow market share. Third, we recommend considering new contracting approaches that help ensure a reliable supply of drugs. This may include providing financial incentives to make certain that manufacturers, especially of older generic drugs, earn sustainable returns on their products. The combination of more complete information about contracting practices and greater transparency of the quality management maturity of specific manufacturing sites would enable payers, purchasers, and GPOs to consider new contracting approaches aimed at making sure there is a reliable supply of medically important drugs. This could be done through several different mechanisms, such as paying higher prices for drugs manufactured at top-rated facilities, requiring a certain quality maturity rating as a condition of contracting, or guaranteeing purchase of a set volume of products from sites achieving a certain quality maturity rating. The report also describes several legislative proposals and planned FDA initiatives that focus primarily on enabling the agency to help prevent supply disruptions that lead to shortages. These include new requests in the President’s FY 2020 budget and new guidances that the agency intends to release by the end of calendar year 2019. We have outlined these specific actions in the report, and they are designed to mitigate and prevent drug shortages nationwide. We also feel that international action is necessary. The (ICH) is finalizing a guideline, “ ,” which provides opportunities for regulatory flexibility in making post-approval changes to the product or its manufacturing process. Global implementation of this guideline, once finalized, could facilitate the efforts of manufacturers for the international market who wish to modernize processes and equipment to avoid potential disruptions, but have found the regulatory landscapes of different countries to pose a financial burden. Given the potential scale of impacts from drug shortages, and the fact that these impacts have continually been underestimated, it is likely that drug shortages will continue to persist absent major changes to this marketplace. The root causes of shortages involve economic factors that are driven by both private- and public-sector decision-making. This means that the types of enduring solutions proposed in the report will require multi-stakeholder efforts and rethinking business practices throughout all sectors of the health care system. It will also require a fuller characterization of the true costs of shortages and more comprehensive and reliable analysis of the effects shortages have on patients and the health care system. We hope that the recommendations set forth in this report will help to set a framework that all stakeholders can assess and implement as we work together to further mitigate the public health impact that drug shortages have on American consumers. In the meantime, the FDA’s employees remain committed to working behind-the-scenes to anticipate and help mitigate shortages and make sure that patients have access to the drugs they need. The FDA will continue to report regularly on the progress of our Task Force and keep the public informed about current drug shortages and our efforts to prevent and mitigate new ones. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Digital submission of adverse event reports for investigational new drug applications reflects FDA’s ongoing modernization efforts", "date": "October 29, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is taking steps towards requiring electronic submission of certain safety reports for products being evaluated by the FDA under an investigational new drug (IND) application into the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System ( ). The planned process for submissions is outlined in a , and the FDA is also making available . The changes will allow the FDA to access and review both pre- and post-market safety information in the same system and with the same data standard. “In September, the FDA rolled out our (TMAP), an ambitious strategy that includes modernizing our technical infrastructure in ways that allow us to receive, analyze, and use data in new ways to advance the FDA’s regulatory mission,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “One way we are working to meet this goal is by designing technical interfaces and tools to enable the streamlined submission and review of data. Creating standard, digital IND safety reports is an important step toward more sophisticated data and technology solutions at the FDA to support efficient development of safe and effective medical products.” The guidance outlines the FDA’s intent to implement a standard digital framework for the electronic submission, review and tracking of certain IND safety reports in FAERS. The publication of the draft guidance and technical documents should assist  sponsors in beginning preparations for when the draft guidance is finalized and effective. IND safety reports will be submitted using a data standard known as ICH E2B. This will provide sponsors with a reporting format that is consistent with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines and consistent with reports used by other regulatory agencies. The FDA will soon announce when sponsors can begin to voluntarily submit IND safety reports to FAERS. “Currently, sponsors of IND applications are required to submit IND safety reports to the FDA, which are submitted for review via a standardized form that is received either in paper format or electronically as a PDF. Review and tracking of these reports in paper or PDF format is inefficient and labor intensive,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The submission of this important safety information as electronic data in structured data elements will improve the FDA’s ability to review and track the safety signals that occur during the conduct of clinical trials. The FDA highly encourages sponsors of all INDs, both commercial and noncommercial, to begin submitting IND safety reports to FAERS voluntarily as soon as the new submission process is available.” IND safety reporting via FAERS will be voluntary until two years after the finalization of the guidance, at which point it will be mandatory for sponsors of commercial INDs that make electronic submissions. Once the requirement is in effect, sponsors will be required to submit certain IND safety reports to FAERS instead of in eCTD format. There will be two options for submission, directly to FAERS and via the Safety Reporting Portal, a web-based submission system that feeds into FAERS. This guidance does not affect the criteria sponsors must use to determine if an IND safety report must be submitted, timelines for reporting, or other elements of IND safety reporting requirements. Because IND data, including clinical trial information, is proprietary and generally not releasable from the FDA, IND safety reports will not be made publicly available. The FDA has created a separate submission path to FAERS for IND safety report submissions so that they remain designated as investigational in FDA’s internal recordkeeping system. The digital framework for IND safety reports was conceived and piloted under the FDA’s Information Exchange and Data Transformation (INFORMED) Program. Working with the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence, in collaboration with the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, several sponsors submitted IND safety reports using the piloted digital framework in parallel to the standard submission process to inform the process. The FDA analyzed results and used the feedback from sponsors to optimize the process for submitting safety reports electronically using the new framework. As part of the TMAP, the FDA is expanding its capability to develop technology products through a series of projects that demonstrate new ways of applying technology and data to the FDA’s regulatory mission. These projects will span the FDA’s broad regulatory responsibilities—from supporting innovation in medical product development to bringing new ways to ensure food safety and increase the effectiveness of the FDA’s field operations. This work will build on the success of INFORMED and similar programs through a new, forward-looking program called CoInnovate@FDA. Designed to be an incubator of modern technology and data projects, CoInnovate@FDA will connect work from across the FDA and the broader learning health system.

{"title": "USDA, EPA and FDA announce partnership with the Food Waste Reduction Alliance ", "date": "October 30, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a new partnership with the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, the latest effort in the Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative launched by the three federal agencies in 2018. Through this g, USDA, EPA and the FDA will formalize industry education and outreach efforts with the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Food Marketing Institute, and the National Restaurant Association, the three founding partners of the Food Waste Reduction Alliance (FWRA). The FWRA represents three major sectors of the supply chain: food manufacturing, retail, and restaurant and food service. The Alliance pursues three goals: reducing the amount of food waste generated; increasing the amount of safe, nutritious food donated to those in need; and diverting food waste from landfills. “The FDA strongly supports our shared goal of reducing the amount of food that Americans waste through important efforts like today’s agreement,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The issues of food waste and food safety go hand in hand and we will continue to work with our federal partners and other stakeholders on enhancing our efforts to reduce food waste and do it safely. We are committed to doing all that we can to support safe and sound food policy decisions that are good for our families, good for our communities, and good for our planet.” “USDA shares many common goals with the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, including our belief in the power of teamwork,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “We are proud to join this public-private partnership to prompt action throughout the food system.” “EPA is proud to build upon the Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative through this partnership with leaders of the Food Waste Reduction Alliance,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “Reducing food loss and waste has many environmental and social benefits. By collaborating with these major segments of the food supply chain, we are making progress toward the national goal to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030.” Federal officials shared the news today at the 2019 Food Waste Summit, hosted by ReFED, a nonprofit that uses a data-driven approach to combat food loss and waste. At the event, federal officials also recognized the growing cadre of , a group of corporations and organizations that have made a public commitment to reduce food loss and waste in their U.S. operations by 50 percent by the year 2030. In the U.S., more than one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste. Food is the single largest type of waste in our daily trash. In recent years, great strides have been made to highlight and mitigate food loss and waste, but the work has just begun. When food is tossed aside, so too are opportunities for economic growth, healthier communities, and environmental protection – but that can change through partnership, leadership, and action. The Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative is a among USDA, EPA and the FDA to reduce food loss and waste through combined and agency-specific action. Individually and collectively, these agencies contribute to the initiative, encourage long-term reductions, and work toward the goal of reducing food loss and waste in the United States. These actions include research, community investments, education and outreach, voluntary programs, public-private partnerships, tool development, technical assistance, event participation and policy discussion.

{"title": "Statement on new testing results, including low levels of impurities in ranitidine drugs ", "date": "November 01, 2019", "contents": " Americans deserve to have confidence in the quality of drugs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates – from the prescription medicines they take to the over-the-counter (OTC) products they use in their daily lives. Helping assure the quality and safety of these products is one of our greatest responsibilities. Over the past several weeks, the FDA has been the detection of a contaminant known as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in ranitidine medications, commonly known by the brand name Zantac. We set out to fully understand this issue and provide actionable information for Americans who use these medications. The information we’ve gathered as part of our ongoing ranitidine investigation has been vital to answering the questions we’ve received about the potential risk of these products. Throughout this process, we’ve been updating our with new information, and we are again providing an update with the latest information. The agency has tested numerous ranitidine products on the market over the past few months, and today we’re releasing a of the results we have to date. Through our testing so far, we have found levels of NDMA in ranitidine that are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats. We also conducted tests that simulate what happens to ranitidine after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet and results of these tests indicate that NDMA is not formed through this process. Similarly, if ranitidine is exposed to a simulated small intestine environment, NDMA is not formed. However, we still must test the drugs in the human body to fully understand if ranitidine forms NDMA. Although many of these levels of NDMA observed through FDA testing are much lower than the levels some third-party scientists first claimed, some levels still exceed what the FDA considers acceptable for these medicines. The calculated acceptable intake for NDMA in drugs is based on methods described in the 2018 . If we or the manufacturers find NDMA levels above the acceptable limits (96 nanograms per day or 0.32 ppm), we’re now asking companies to voluntarily recall ranitidine. We would also ask manufacturers to voluntarily recall nizatidine, commonly known as Axid, if they found NDMA above the acceptable daily intake level because it is chemically similar to ranitidine. We’re also asking manufacturers to continue conducting their own laboratory testing to in ranitidine and nizatidine as well as to send samples to the FDA to be tested by our scientists. Additionally, we have requested that manufacturers of nizatidine test their drugs. We are still working with manufacturers to investigate the true source of NDMA and to understand the root cause of the low levels of NDMA present in the drugs. In the meantime, our recommendations for consumers and patients have not changed. Consumers taking OTC ranitidine or nizatidine can consider using other OTC products approved for their condition. So far, the FDA and industry testing of medicines in the histamine-2 (H2) blocker and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) classes has identified NDMA only in ranitidine and nizatidine. The FDA’s tests of samples of alternatives such as Pepcid (famotidine), Tagamet (cimetidine), Nexium (esomeprazole), Prevacid (lansoprazole) and Prilosec (omeprazole) show no NDMA impurities in the medicines. Patients taking prescription ranitidine or nizatidine should speak with their health care professional about other treatment options. There are multiple drugs approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine and nizatidine. Additionally, in our testing of ranitidine syrup, primarily used in neonates and pediatric patients, some samples yielded levels of NDMA above the acceptable daily intake level in some lots. Medicines with unacceptable levels are being recalled. We understand the concern we’ve been hearing from parents and pediatricians, and we’ll continue to investigate. Testing of ranitidine for injection is still ongoing. We’ve been asked if testing methods have changed since these products were approved, and whether, in light of this situation, we should look at the safety of other older drugs. Drug manufacturers and the FDA continually gain knowledge about drugs, which is why the FDA constantly evaluates quality and safety information as it is learned. As testing methods have become more sophisticated and sensitive, the FDA and industry can identify and mitigate previously unknown risks to patients. This is something we are thoroughly aware of, and we have ongoing assessment, surveillance, compliance and pharmaceutical quality efforts across every product area to work to ensure similar impurities can be kept out of our drug supply. We also maintain a robust practice of postmarket surveillance and risk evaluation programs to identify adverse events that did not appear during the product development process. Evaluations occur on more than two million adverse event reports submitted every year to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) through the MedWatch Program by patients, family members and health care providers, as well as adverse event reports submitted by regulated industry. We use this information to identify safety concerns and recommend actions to improve product safety and protect the public. Patients and health care professionals are encouraged to report any adverse reaction to the agency’s We know impurities in medicines are of great concern to patients and consumers who rely on safe and effective medicines approved by the FDA, and we are working with manufacturers and global regulators to provide clear and actionable information. These investigations take time and do not provide instantaneous answers. The FDA is committed to sharing all findings when we have adequate understanding of the situation and of what actions should be taken. We will continue to work with drug manufacturers to ensure safe, effective, and high-quality drugs for the American public.

Safe, effective and high-quality play a vital role in our health care system. Generic drugs account for about 90% of all prescription drug purchases in the U.S. In 2018, competition from generic drugs saved the health care system about $293 billion. Thanks to the FDA’s ongoing efforts under the , the FDA has built a thriving generic drug program that continues to impress me. I am pleased to report that our generic drug program is having another strong year. While we expect to see highs and lows in our approval numbers from month to month based in part on what is submitted to us for assessment, I’m delighted to share that our overall show a total of 1,171 generic drug approvals (935 full approvals and 236 tentative approvals). This breaks our all-time record of 971 for fiscal year 2018. Additionally, in fiscal year 2019 we approved 125 applications for of medicines that had no generic competition. First generics approved in fiscal year 2019 included an and drugs to treat conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, breast cancer, , depression and various infections. Also, of note, the FDA is approving increasing numbers of complex generic drugs, which are harder to copy and traditionally have lacked competition. Moreover, we know it is not enough to just bring more generics to market. Consumers must also have confidence in the safety and quality of . The FDA’s scientific review and assessment process for generic drug applications ensures that generic medications perform the same way in the human body, have the same active ingredients and have the same conditions of use as their counterpart name brand medication. Generic drugs are held to high approval and manufacturing standards and once a generic medication is approved, the FDA continues to monitor its safety, effectiveness and quality, including through periodic inspections of manufacturing plants, careful evaluation of post-approval changes proposed by manufacturers and thorough assessment of any adverse event reports. The value of our generic drug program runs deep, and we are engaged in a number of efforts to help ensure the program remains vibrant. We’re encouraged to see that the pipeline of generic drug applications is strong and that there is ongoing interest in the development of generic versions of complex drugs and of other drugs with inadequate generic competition. In the coming months, we plan to publish additional guidances and take other important policy steps to assist generic drug applicants, including planning additional conferences on generic drug development to further engage with stakeholders and generic drug developers.

{"title": "FDA allows marketing of first rapid diagnostic test for detecting Ebola virus antigens", "date": "October 10, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed marketing of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect Ebola virus antigens (proteins) in human blood from certain living individuals and samples from certain recently deceased individuals suspected to have died from Ebola (cadaveric oral fluid). The Test is the first rapid diagnostic test the FDA has allowed to be marketed in the U.S. for the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The test provides a rapid, presumptive diagnosis that must be confirmed. “Today’s marketing authorization provides another important tool in the effort to fight Ebola, which continues to be a priority of the U.S. Government, especially as we work with our partners, including the World Health Organization, to help address the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The current outbreak in the DRC has already killed thousands and the outbreaks in West Africa that began in 2014 tragically killed more than 11,000. Investigational vaccines and therapeutics have shown promising results, but one of the most important tools in stopping these outbreaks is quickly diagnosing patients and supporting safe and dignified burials. This marketing authorization may provide additional assurances to health care professionals seeking to use these types of rapid diagnostics. The ability to use this test to promptly make a presumptive Ebola diagnosis could help providers to more quickly isolate patients and begin treatments that can be potentially life-saving. Additionally, this device could be used to support safe and dignified burials while helping to reduce the risk of transmission during those burials.” EVD, which is caused by the Ebola virus, is a severe, often fatal disease in humans that can spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids or objects contaminated with body fluids, as well as from the bodies of those who have died from the virus. EVD has led to several large outbreaks in Africa, including the West African Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 and was the largest outbreak of EVD in recorded history, and the ongoing outbreak in the DRC, which is currently the second largest outbreak. Extensive efforts are underway by the Ministry of Health in the DRC to contain the current outbreak with support from the World Health Organization, the U.S. government, and other partners. These measures include campaigns to promote good hygiene, large-scale vaccination campaigns, specialized Ebola treatment centers where those infected or exposed to the virus can receive investigational therapeutics, and comprehensive efforts to trace and prevent the spread of EVD through vaccination campaigns, monitoring for symptoms, diagnostic testing, and implementation of infection prevention and control measures, such as safe and dignified burial procedures. During the 2014 outbreak, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection of Ebola virus. At the time, the FDA worked with CDC and test developers to make diagnostic tests, including the OraQuick Ebola Test, available through the (EUA) pathway. This pathway allows the FDA to temporarily authorize the use of unapproved medical products to address a public health emergency when specific conditions are met, including that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the disease or condition. The FDA has authorized a number of diagnostic tests for EVD under the EUA pathway to assist with the public health response. Today’s marketing authorization of the first EVD presumptive rapid diagnostic test for Ebola virus antigens through the De Novo review pathway reflects the ongoing collaboration between the U.S. Government and test developers to gather additional data on EUA products. For the OraQuick Ebola Test submission, the FDA reviewed data from multiple clinical studies of blood samples and cadaveric oral fluid from the 2014 West African outbreak and from a variety of analytical studies. Based on these data, the FDA determined that general and special controls were necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the OraQuick Ebola Test when intended to identify antigens associated with Ebola virus in blood from symptomatic patients and oral fluid of cadavers. The amount of Ebola virus when patients have severe symptoms of EVD is usually high; however, the amount of virus in samples taken early after infection when symptoms are not present yet or taken early during the course of EVD when symptoms are mild can be very low. The studies demonstrated the importance of testing only symptomatic individuals so that the amount of virus is high enough to be detectable by this test. Therefore, the OraQuick Ebola Test is intended for use in patients suspected of and with signs or symptoms consistent with EVD, and when the patient meets the , such as history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active EVD transmission at the time of travel. The OraQuick Ebola Test is not intended to be used for general Ebola infection screening (e.g., airport screening) or testing of individuals at risk of exposure without observable signs of infection. The OraQuick Ebola Test may also be used in recently deceased individuals (cadaveric oral fluid) with epidemiological risk factors (including geographic locations with high prevalence of EVD) suspected to have died of EVD to inform decisions on safe handling of cadavers to prevent disease transmission. Negative results do not rule out Ebola virus infection. The definitive identification of EVD requires additional testing and confirmation procedures (such as by a more sensitive but less rapid polymerase chain reaction test) and in consultation with public health and/or other authorities to whom reporting is required. The OraQuick Ebola Test was reviewed under the , a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this marketing authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that determine the requirements for demonstrating accuracy, reliability and effectiveness of tests intended to identify Ebola virus antigens. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The OraQuick Ebola Test was granted designation, meaning the FDA provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development, to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the device. To qualify for such designation, a device must provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition, and meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the OraQuick Ebola Test to OraSure Technologies, Inc.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for patients with migraine", "date": "October 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Reyvow (lasmiditan) tablets for the acute (active but short-term) treatment of migraine with or without aura (a sensory phenomenon or visual disturbance) in adults. Reyvow is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. “Reyvow is a new option for the acute treatment of migraine, a painful condition that affects one in seven Americans,” said Nick Kozauer, M.D., acting deputy director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “We know that the migraine community is keenly interested in additional treatment options, and we remain committed to continuing to work with stakeholders to promote the development of new therapies for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine.” Migraine headache pain is often described as an intense throbbing or pulsing pain in one area of the head. Additional symptoms include nausea and/or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Approximately one-third of individuals who suffer from migraine also experience aura shortly before the migraine. An aura can appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines, or a temporary loss of vision. Migraines can often be triggered by various factors including stress, hormonal changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep, and diet. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men and affects more than 10% of people worldwide. The effectiveness of Reyvow for the acute treatment of migraine was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A total of 3,177 adult patients with a history of migraine with and without aura treated a migraine attack with Reyvow in these studies. In both studies, the percentages of patients whose pain resolved and whose most bothersome migraine symptom (nausea, light sensitivity, or sound sensitivity) resolved two hours after treatment were significantly greater among patients receiving Reyvow at all doses compared to those receiving placebo. Although patients were allowed to take a rescue medication two hours after taking Reyvow, opioids, barbiturates, triptans and ergots were not allowed within 24 hours of the study drug’s administration. Twenty-two percent of patients were taking a preventive medication for migraine. There is a risk of driving impairment while taking Reyvow. Patients are advised not to drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after taking Reyvow, even if they feel well enough to do so. Patients who cannot follow this advice are advised not to take Reyvow. The drug causes central nervous system (CNS) depression, including dizziness and sedation. It should be used with caution if taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants. The most common side effects that patients in the clinical trials reported were dizziness, fatigue, a burning or prickling sensation in the skin (paresthesia), and sedation. The FDA granted the approval of Reyvow to Eli Lilly and Company.

{"title": "FDA approves new breakthrough therapy for cystic fibrosis", "date": "October 21, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Trikafta (elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor), the first triple combination therapy available to treat patients with the most common cystic fibrosis mutation. Trikafta is approved for patients 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which is estimated to represent 90% of the cystic fibrosis population. “At the FDA, we’re consistently looking for ways to help speed the development of new therapies for complex diseases, while maintaining our high standards of review. Today’s landmark approval is a testament to these efforts, making a novel treatment available to most cystic fibrosis patients, including adolescents, who previously had no options and giving others in the cystic fibrosis community access to an additional effective therapy,” said acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “In the past few years, we have seen remarkable breakthroughs in therapies to treat cystic fibrosis and improve patients’ quality of life, yet many subgroups of cystic fibrosis patients did not have approved treatment options. That’s why we used all available programs, including Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and orphan drug designation, to help advance today’s approval in the most efficient manner possible, while also adhering to our high standards. The FDA remains committed to advancing novel treatment options for areas of unmet patient need, particularly for diseases affecting children.” Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States. The efficacy of Trikafta in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in two trials. The first trial was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 403 patients who had an F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor alone. The second trial was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 107 patients who had two identical F508del mutations. In each trial, the primary analysis looked at increases in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, known as ppFEV1, which is an established marker of cystic fibrosis lung disease progression. Trikafta increased the ppFEV1 in both trials. In the first trial, it increased mean ppFEV1 13.8% from baseline compared to placebo. In the second trial, it increased mean ppFEV1 10% from baseline compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. In the first trial, treatment with Trikafta also resulted in improvements in sweat chloride, number of pulmonary exacerbations (worsening respiratory symptoms and lung function), and body mass index (weight-to-height ratio) compared to placebo. The safety profile of Trikafta is based on data from the 510 cystic fibrosis patients in the two trials. The safety profile was generally similar across all subgroups of patients. Serious adverse drug reactions that occurred more frequently in patients receiving Trikafta compared to placebo were rash and influenza (flu) events. The most common adverse drug reactions included headaches, upper respiratory tract infections, abdominal pains, diarrhea, rashes, increased liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), nasal congestion, increased blood creatine phosphokinase (an enzyme that can be associated with muscle damage), rhinorrhea (mucus in the nasal cavity), rhinitis (swelling of the mucous membrane of the nose), influenza, sinusitis and increased blood bilirubin (may be caused by problems involving the liver, gallbladder or red blood cells). The prescribing information for Trikafta includes warnings related to elevated liver function tests (transaminases and bilirubin), use at the same time with other products that are inducers or inhibitors of another liver enzyme called Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A), and the risk of cataracts. Patients and their caregivers should speak with a health care professional about these risks and any medicines they take before starting treatment. Patients with cystic fibrosis should speak with a health care professional and have tests performed to understand which gene mutations they have. The presence of at least one F508del mutation should be confirmed using an FDA-cleared genotyping assay prior to treatment. The safety and effectiveness of Trikafta in patients with cystic fibrosis younger than 12 years of age have not been established. The FDA granted this application , in addition to . Trikafta also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. Drugs approved under expedited programs are held to the same approval standards as other FDA approvals. Because of Trikafta’s benefit to the cystic fibrosis community, the FDA reviewed and approved Trikafta in approximately three months, ahead of the March 19, 2020 review goal date. The approval of Trikafta was granted to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, which will receive a for developing this therapy.

We are working to protect Americans from companies marketing products with unsubstantiated claims that they prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure a number of diseases or conditions. This is especially concerning when companies are peddling unproven CBD products for use in vulnerable populations like infants and children,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We’ve sent numerous warning letters that focus on matters of significant public health concern to CBD companies, and these actions should send a message to the broader market about complying with FDA requirements. As we examine potential regulatory pathways for the lawful marketing of cannabis products, protecting and promoting public health through sound, science-based decision-making remains our top priority. We appreciate the FTC joining us on these and other actions to protect consumers from fraudulent CBD products.” As described in the warning letter issued to Rooted Apothecary, the company used product webpages, through its online store and social media websites, to make unfounded claims about its CBD products, and some of the products were also unlawfully marketed as dietary supplements. The agency has determined that CBD products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements. Examples of the unsupported claims made by the company include: Additionally, under the Federal Trade Commission Act, it is unlawful to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless the advertiser possesses competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. The FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. These products are also misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, because the products’ labels and product information fail to include adequate directions for use. Drugs in the United States must contain directions explaining how a consumer can use a drug safely for its intended purpose. Under the law, there is an exemption for this labeling requirement for prescription drugs that have FDA-approved applications in effect. However, none of Rooted Apothecary’s products are FDA-approved. The FDA and FTC have requested responses from Rooted Apothecary within 15 working days stating how the company will correct the violations. Failure to correct the violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and/or injunction. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or administrative cease and desist order, and an order also may require that a company pay back money to consumers. The FDA continues to be concerned about the proliferation of products claiming to contain CBD that are marketed for therapeutic or medical uses that have not been approved by the agency. The FDA approval process ensures that drugs on the market are safe and effective for their intended therapeutic uses. CBD is marketed in a variety of product types, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas and topical lotions and creams. The FDA has not approved any CBD products other than to treat rare, severe forms of epilepsy. There is very limited information for other marketed CBD products, which likely differ in composition from the FDA-approved product and have not been evaluated for potential adverse effects on the body. The FDA continues to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. An important component of this work is obtaining and evaluating information to address outstanding questions related to the safety of CBD products while maintaining the FDA’s rigorous public health standards. “The FDA is working quickly to further clarify our regulatory approach for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds like CBD while using all available resources to monitor the marketplace and protect public health by taking action as needed against companies,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “We recognize that there is significant public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds; however, we must work together to fill in the knowledge gaps about the science, safety and quality of many of these products. We are committed to advancing our regulation of these products through an approach that, in line with our mission, prioritizes public health, fosters innovation and promotes consumer confidence.” Unlike drugs approved by the FDA, the manufacturing process of unapproved CBD products has not been subject to FDA review as part of the drug approval process. Further, there has been no FDA evaluation of whether these products are effective for their intended use, what the proper dosage is, how they could interact with FDA-approved drugs, or whether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns. Consumers may put off getting important medical care, such as proper diagnosis, treatment and supportive care due to unsubstantiated claims associated with CBD products. For that reason, it’s important that consumers talk to a health care professional about the best way to treat diseases or conditions with existing, approved treatment options. The FDA has previously sent to other companies illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat or cure serious diseases, such as cancer. Some of these products were in further violation of the FD&C Act because they were marketed as dietary supplements or because they involved the addition of CBD to food. The FDA encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse reactions associated with these or similar products to the agency’s The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

It seems like an attractive and safe option for children.” “CBD oil may have neuroprotective properties and may protect against neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.” “[P]ossible uses for CBD include helping with skin problems such as acne, autism, ADHD, and even cancer. It’s often used in conjunction with traditional treatments to provide extra help. Children can use high amounts of CBD safely and without any risk.”"},
{"title": "FDA grants first-ever modified risk orders to eight smokeless tobacco products ", "date": "October 22, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today that, for the first time, it has authorized the marketing of products through the modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) pathway. The authorizations are for eight Swedish Match USA, Inc. snus smokeless tobacco products sold under the “General” brand name. These products had previously been authorized for U.S. sale without modified risk claims by the FDA in 2015 in response to filings of premarket tobacco applications (PMTAs). Today’s action further authorizes the manufacturer to market these specific products with the claim “Using General Snus instead of cigarettes puts you at a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.” The FDA made this authorization after reviewing scientific evidence submitted by the company that supports this claim. In an effort to help prevent youth access and exposure, the agency has also placed stringent advertising and promotion restrictions on the products, including a requirement to restrict advertising to adults. In addition, the products’ packaging and advertising must also bear the required for all smokeless tobacco products. While today’s decision permits the eight General brand snus smokeless tobacco products to be sold in the U.S. with a modified risk claim, it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA approved.” All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive, and those who do not use tobacco products should continue to refrain from their use. The modified risk orders are product-specific and limited to five years. “Today’s action demonstrates the viability of the pathway for companies to market specific tobacco products as less harmful to consumers, but only following a thorough scientific evaluation by the FDA. Our team of scientific experts examined these applications to ensure that the tobacco products meet the public health standards in the law. While we are authorizing these specific modified risk tobacco products, it’s important for the public to understand that all tobacco products — including these — pose risk. Anyone who does not currently use tobacco products, especially youth, should refrain from doing so,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “In addition to stringent restrictions to limit youth access and exposure to advertising, this time-limited authorization comes with a number of postmarket requirements that will allow us to keep a close watch on the marketplace. Should any information lead us to determine that the marketing of these products as posing less risk no longer benefits the health of the population as a whole, the agency would consider withdrawing this authorization.” While all tobacco products pose risks, the MRTP pathway outlined in the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act allows companies to submit applications for the FDA to evaluate whether a tobacco product may be sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products. In its review, the FDA generally must look at whether the applicant has demonstrated that the product – as actually used by consumers – will significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users and benefit the health of the population as a whole. This includes taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products. In making this assessment, the agency must consider, among other things, whether those who do not use tobacco products would start using the product and whether existing tobacco users who would have otherwise quit would switch to the modified risk product instead. Today’s announcement marks the first time that the FDA has authorized an MRTP. The FDA’s review determined that the claim proposed by the company in its application is supported by scientific evidence, that consumers understand the claim and appropriately perceive the relative risk of these products compared to cigarettes, and that the modified risk products, as actually used by consumers, will significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users and benefit the health of the population as a whole. In particular, the available scientific evidence, including long-term epidemiological studies, shows that relative to cigarette smoking, exclusive use of these specific smokeless tobacco products poses lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Evidence submitted in the application also demonstrated that consumers can understand the claim and the relative risk of the products, and that seeing the claim influenced their intentions to buy the products among smokers 25 years of age or older – a group who stands to benefit the most from the modified risk tobacco products. Consumers also generally understood that the risk reduction is not achieved from partial switching (i.e., dual use of the products with continued use of cigarettes), thereby increasing the likelihood that smokers will switch completely. In addition to these lower risks relative to cigarette smoking, the FDA previously determined that the levels of two potent carcinogens in smokeless tobacco products called are lower in these General snus products than the vast majority of smokeless tobacco products on the U.S. market. In addition, the evidence showed when used exclusively instead of other smokeless tobacco products, the General snus products offer the potential for reductions in oral cancer risk. The available evidence does not demonstrate significant youth initiation of these products, and evidence submitted by the company also found low levels of intentions to buy the product among non-users of tobacco (including young adults) and, importantly, found that the inclusion of the modified risk claim did not affect these intentions. In addition, to further limit the likelihood of youth initiation, the FDA is placing stringent restrictions on how the products are advertised and promoted – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including restrictions that prevent advertising from being targeted to youth. With the authorization of these products, the company is required to conduct postmarket studies to determine the impact of modified risk tobacco product orders on consumer perception, behavior, and health. Relatedly, the FDA will evaluate new available data regarding the products through postmarket records and reports required in the modified risk orders. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. To continuously market these same products with the same modified risk information beyond the five-year limit would require the company to submit a request for renewal and receive renewal authorization from the FDA before the current orders expire. The FDA may withdraw the initial and any potential subsequent modified risk orders if the agency determines that, among other things, the continued marketing of the product no longer benefits the health of the population as a whole. Prior to today’s MRTP authorization, the eight General brand snus smokeless tobacco products were without modified risk claims through the PMTA pathway in November 2015.The FDA’s review of those applications found, among other things, that levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents in these products are lower than most other smokeless tobacco products. The FDA an MRTP request from the company for these same products to remove a currently required warning stating that the products can cause gum disease and tooth loss. At that time, the FDA also issued a response to the applicant’s requests to remove a currently required warning stating that the products can cause mouth cancer and to revise a currently required warning stating that the products are not a safe alternative to cigarettes. This response offered the company an option to amend its MRTP applications.

This approval represents another step forward in the FDA’s overall efforts to ensure safe and effective antimicrobial drugs are available to patients for treating infections.” The safety and effectiveness of Fetroja was demonstrated in a study of 448 patients with cUTIs. Of the patients who were administered Fetroja, 72.6% had resolution of symptoms and eradication of the bacteria approximately seven days after completing treatment, compared with 54.6% in patients who received an alternative antibiotic. The clinical response rates were similar between the two treatment groups. Labeling for Fetroja includes a warning regarding the higher all-cause mortality rate observed in Fetroja-treated patients compared to those treated with other antibiotics in a trial in critically ill patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established. Some of the deaths were a result of worsening or complications of infection, or underlying co-morbidities. The higher all-cause mortality rate was observed in patients treated for hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (i.e.nosocomial pneumonia), bloodstream infections, or sepsis. The safety and efficacy of Fetroja has not been established for the treatment of these types of infections. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Fetroja included diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, elevations in liver tests, rash, infusion site reactions, candidiasis (yeast infection), cough, headache and hypokalemia (low potassium). Fetroja should not be used in individuals with a known history of severe hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Fetroja received the (QIDP) designation. The QIDP designation is given to antibacterial and antifungal drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. As part of QIDP designation, Fetroja was granted under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame.

{"title": "FDA approves first contact lens indicated to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children", "date": "November 15, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first contact lens indicated to slow the progression of myopia (nearsightedness) in children between the ages of 8 and 12 years old at the initiation of treatment. The MiSight contact lens is a single use, disposable, soft contact lens that is discarded at the end of each day, and is not intended to be worn overnight. “Today’s approval is the first FDA-approved product to slow the progression of myopia in children, which ultimately could mean a reduced risk of developing other eye problems,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., director of the Office of Ophthalmic, Anesthesia, Respiratory, ENT and Dental Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Myopia is the most frequent cause of correctable visual impairment worldwide. Myopia occurs when the eye grows too long from front to back (axial length). Instead of focusing images on the retina, images are focused at a point in front of the retina. As a result, people with myopia have good near vision, but poor distance vision that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Myopia is common in children and tends to increase as they get older. If a person develops severe myopia as a child, they may be susceptible to other eye problems such as early cataracts or a detached retina during adulthood. The MiSight soft contact lenses are meant to be worn daily to correct nearsightedness and slow the progression of myopia in children with healthy eyes. When placed on the eye, one part of the MiSight contact lens corrects the refractive error to improve distance vision in nearsighted eyes, similar to a standard corrective lens. In addition, concentric peripheral rings in the lens focus part of the light in front of the retina (the back of the eye). This is believed to reduce the stimulus causing the progression of myopia. The approval of MiSight was based on data obtained from a prospective clinical trial at four clinical sites and real-world evidence. The safety and effectiveness of MiSight was studied in a three-year randomized, controlled clinical trial of 135 children ages 8 to 12 at the start of treatment who used MiSight or a conventional soft contact lens. The trial showed that for the full three-year period, the progression in myopia of those wearing MiSight lenses was less than those wearing conventional soft contact lenses. In addition, subjects who used MiSight had less change in the axial length of the eyeball at each annual checkup. Over the course of the trial, there were no serious ocular adverse events in either arm of the study. Additionally, to estimate the rate of vision-threatening corneal infections (i.e., corneal ulcers) among children and adolescents who wear soft contact lenses daily, the FDA reviewed real world data from a retrospective analysis of medical records of 782 children ages 8 to 12 years old from seven community eye care clinics. The results showed a rate comparable to the rate of ulcer cases among adults who wear contact lenses daily. As part of the approval of MiSight, the sponsor is required to conduct a postmarket study of the contact lenses to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product as indicated. The FDA granted approval of MiSight to CooperVision Inc. The device was approved using the .

{"title": "Trump Administration Combating Epidemic of Youth E-Cigarette Use with Plan to Clear Market of Unauthorized, Non-Tobacco-Flavored E-Cigarette Products", "date": "September 11, 2019", "contents": " Today, the Trump Administration announced that as part of its ongoing work to tackle the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use, the FDA intends to finalize a compliance policy in the coming weeks that would prioritize the agency’s enforcement of the premarket authorization requirements for non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, including mint and menthol, clearing the market of unauthorized, non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products. The FDA plans to share more on the specific details of the plan and its implementation soon. “The Trump Administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “We will not stand idly by as these products become an on-ramp to combustible cigarettes or nicotine addiction for a generation of youth.” Today’s announcement comes as preliminary numbers from the National Youth Tobacco Survey show a continued rise in the disturbing rates of youth e-cigarette use, especially through the use of non-tobacco flavors that appeal to kids. In particular, the preliminary data show that more than a quarter of high school students were current (past 30 day) e-cigarette users in 2019 and the overwhelming majority of youth e-cigarette users cited the use of popular fruit and menthol or mint flavors. “We appreciate President Trump and Secretary Azar’s continued support of the agency’s efforts to prevent youth use of e-cigarettes, including the bold approach we’re announcing today. Once finalized, this compliance policy will serve as a powerful tool that the FDA can use to combat the troubling trend of youth e-cigarette use. We must act swiftly against flavored e-cigarette products that are especially attractive to children. Moreover, if we see a migration to tobacco-flavored products by kids, we will take additional steps to address youth use of these products,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The tremendous progress we’ve made in reducing youth tobacco use in the U.S. is jeopardized by this onslaught of e-cigarette use. Nobody wants to see children becoming addicted to nicotine, and we will continue to use the full scope of our regulatory authority thoughtfully and thoroughly to tackle this mounting public health crisis.” Following a rule which became effective August 8, 2016, all electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products were expected to file premarket tobacco product applications with the FDA within two years. ENDS products currently on the market are not being legally marketed and are subject to government action. The compliance policy the FDA anticipates announcing in the coming weeks will outline enforcement policy addressing non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products that lack premarket authorization moving forward. The Trump Administration has demonstrated a deep commitment to preventing youth from using all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, and the finalization of the compliance policy will be an important step in ongoing work to ensure e-cigarettes are not marketed to, sold to, or used by kids. The FDA has been holding retailers and manufacturers for marketing and sales practices that have led to increased youth accessibility and appeal of e-cigarettes. For example, the FDA has issued more than 8,600 warning letters and more than 1,000 civil money penalties (fines) to retailers — both online and in brick-and-mortar retail stores — for sales of ENDS and their components to minors. The agency has also issued warning letters — many in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — that resulted in the market removal of dozens of e-liquid products resembling kid-friendly juice boxes, cereal, and candy. Additionally, the FDA and FTC cited firms that make and sell flavored e-liquids for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on their behalf. Most recently, on September 9, the FDA issued a for marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products by engaging in labeling, advertising, and/or other activities directed to consumers, including a presentation given to youth at a school. Concurrently, the agency issued a second letter expressing its concern — and requesting additional information — about several issues raised in a recent Congressional hearing regarding JUUL’s outreach and marking practices, including those targeted at students, tribes, health insurers and employers. The Administration has also continued to invest in campaigns to educate youth about the dangers of e-cigarette use. Last year, the FDA launched “ – a comprehensive effort targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. The campaign features hard-hitting advertising on TV, digital and social media sites popular among teens, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages in high schools across the nation. The FDA in partnership with the Surgeon General joined forces with Scholastic to distribute youth e-cigarette prevention posters and lesson plans to every public and private high school in the U.S. – with additional resources planned for middle school educators throughout the 2019-2020 school year. The agency also released resources for doctors, youth groups, churches, state and local public health agencies, and others on the dangers of youth e-cigarette use and has undertaken efforts to further the discussion and understanding around how to help aid those kids who are already addicted to e-cigarettes quit. In December 2018, the Surgeon General on e-cigarette use among youth, emphasizing the importance of protecting youth from a lifetime of nicotine addiction and associated health risks in light of the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.

{"title": "Statement alerting patients and health care professionals of NDMA found in samples of ranitidine", "date": "September 13, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has learned that some ranitidine medicines, including some products commonly known as the brand-name drug Zantac, contain a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products, and vegetables. The FDA has been investigating NDMA and other nitrosamine impurities in blood pressure and heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) since last year. In the case of ARBs, the FDA has recommended numerous recalls as it discovered unacceptable levels of nitrosamines. When the agency identifies a problem, it takes appropriate action quickly to protect patients. The FDA is evaluating whether the low levels of NDMA in ranitidine pose a risk to patients. FDA will post that information when it is available. Patients should be able to trust that their medicines are as safe as they can be and that the benefits of taking them outweigh any risk to their health. Although NDMA may cause harm in large amounts, the levels the FDA is finding in ranitidine from preliminary tests barely exceed amounts you might expect to find in common foods. Ranitidine is an over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drug. Ranitidine is an H2 (histamine-2) blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach. Over-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid ingestion and sour stomach. Prescription ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The agency is working with international regulators and industry partners to determine the source of this impurity in ranitidine. The agency is examining levels of NDMA in ranitidine and evaluating any possible risk to patients. The FDA will take appropriate measures based on the results of the ongoing investigation. The agency will provide more information as it becomes available. The FDA is not calling for individuals to stop taking ranitidine at this time; however, patients taking prescription ranitidine who wish to discontinue use should talk to their health care professional about other treatment options. People taking OTC ranitidine could consider using other OTC medicines approved for their condition. There are multiple drugs on the market that are approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine.

{"title": "FDA takes first action under new international collaboration with Australia and Canada designed to provide a framework for concurrent review of cancer therapies, approving treatment for patients with endometrial carcinoma", "date": "September 17, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE). Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. Under this project, the FDA, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada collaboratively reviewed applications for two oncology drugs, allowing for simultaneous decisions in all three countries. “We are pleased to be working alongside our Australian and Canadian colleagues to help make potentially life-changing treatments available to patients as quickly as possible while still ensuring the FDA’s high standards of safety and effectiveness,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “As Project Orbis expands, we look forward to welcoming additional international partners to collaborate with us in this important initiative as we work to help further serve the global patient community.” Collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions, regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval. This is partly due to different standards of care around the world that also have an impact on the increasingly international conduct of cancer clinical trials, potentially slowing the development of anticancer products. With a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs, Project Orbis facilitates a collaborative review to identify any regulatory divergence across review teams. As part of Project Orbis, in conjunction with decisions by TGA and Health Canada, the FDA today granted accelerated approval to Lenvima (lenvatinib) in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), and who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy but are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Endometrial cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium). Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female genital tract. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and certain estrogen promoting medications may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Symptoms may include unusual vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis. “In addition to the international collaboration with Australia and Canada, this review used the ‘Real-Time Oncology Review’ (RTOR) pilot program, which can streamline the submission of data prior to the completion and submission of the entire clinical application,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “RTOR, and its accompanying Assessment Aid, facilitated discussions among the regulatory agencies, expediting the approval in the three countries. These applications were approved three months prior to the FDA goal date.” Lenvima was initially approved by the FDA in 2015 and Keytruda was initially approved in 2014. Today’s approval of Lenvima in combination with Keytruda was based on the results of a clinical trial of 94 patients with endometrial carcinoma tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR. Of the 94 patients, 10 patients (10.6% of responders) had a complete response, or disappearance of all lesions on imaging, and 26 patients (27.7% of responders) had a partial response, or shrinkage of lesions by at least 30%, leading to an objective response rate of 38.3%. Of these, 25 patients (69% of responders) have a duration of response of greater than 6 months. Common side effects for patients in the clinical trial included fatigue, high blood pressure, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), nausea and stomatitis (inflamed and sore mouth). Additional side effects included vomiting, decreased weight, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, urinary tract infection, dysphonia (voice difficulty), hemorrhagic events (bleeding), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand foot syndrome), dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough and rash. Health care professionals should inform females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lenvima in combination with Keytruda. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take this combination because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Lenvima in combination with Keytruda was granted . This approval commits the sponsor to provide additional data to the FDA. The application also received and both Lenvima and Keytruda had received for this indication.

{"title": "FDA continues to take steps to fulfill its commitment to strengthen and modernize the 510(k) medical device program", "date": "September 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced that, as a first step toward implementation of the recently established for medical devices, the agency is issuing draft guidances outlining the recommended premarket performance criteria and testing methodologies for four specific types of devices. These are anticipated to be the first device types eligible for the new, voluntary premarket notification pathway to market devices, which was earlier this year. The initial device types being considered for eligibility for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway under the draft guidances issued today include: “One of our goals with the Safety and Performance Based Pathway is to ensure that the 510(k) program is keeping pace with the important innovations we’re seeing in device development. This new pathway reflects our focus on advancing new products that are safer and more effective,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This new option for 510(k) clearance of certain well-understood device types will allow manufacturers to use objective performance criteria—established or recognized by the FDA—to demonstrate substantial equivalence of their new products or superior performance to those already legally on the market. For example, if a manufacturer wants to market a new spinal plating system that falls within the scope of the guidance, with this new pathway, they would submit a 510(k) demonstrating that the safety and performance characteristics of their device are consistent with the new FDA-identified criteria. They would not need to provide a side-by-side performance assessment with a predicate device. The major benefit is that the pathway will benchmark modern technology against modern standards while, at the same time, offering a potentially more efficient way to demonstrate a new device is substantially equivalent to devices already on the market. This ensures patients have timely access to beneficial products. This new approach may also drive greater market competition to develop safer, more effective devices by providing the opportunity to demonstrate superior performance to the FDA-established benchmarks.” The Safety and Performance Based Pathway provides an option to medical device manufacturers seeking premarket clearance of certain, well-understood device types. With a premarket notification, also known as a 510(k), a manufacturer demonstrates that its product has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as a device already on the market (known as a predicate device); if the product has different technological characteristics, the manufacturer must demonstrate that its product is at least as safe and effective as, and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than, the predicate device. Manufacturers often conduct direct comparison testing to demonstrate that a new device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. In some cases, predicates may be older and may not reflect modern technologies embedded in new devices. In the new pathway, the safety and performance characteristics of new devices are evaluated against a set of FDA-identified objective and transparent metrics consistent with the safety and performance characteristics of modern predicates. Devices being reviewed and cleared under this new pathway must still meet regulatory requirements for safety and effectiveness; however, the FDA expects this pathway to promote a competitive marketplace for developing even safer, more effective technologies, ultimately giving patients timely access to more beneficial medical devices. These first four device-specific guidances were chosen because for these device types, the agency had already worked to develop performance criteria and/or FDA-recognized consensus standards exist for the performance of these devices. The FDA is soliciting public feedback on these guidances, which will assist in the finalization of the initial device-specific guidances and also aid in expansion of the pathway to other types of medical devices in the coming months. In addition to publishing these four draft guidances, the FDA is also updating the Safety and Performance Based pathway guidance issued in February 2019 to further clarify the information the FDA will review in a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In February 2019, the FDA announced the for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway through . It is optional and will not change existing review processes.

The drugs—which include compounded ophthalmic products among other drug products — pose unnecessary risks due to significant quality and sterility concerns. “When the FDA becomes aware of drugs that have the potential to cause harm to American consumers, we will alert the public, Prior to today’s outreach, AmEx Pharmacy refused to recall all sterile drug products and has not adequately addressed FDA’s concern that it is manufacturing drugs that are not in line with the quality standards we’ve set, putting patients at risk,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We urge drug manufacturers and compounders to take appropriate action to ensure quality medicines as the agency continues our efforts to protect public health.” of AmEx Pharmacy’s facility found conditions that could cause the company’s drugs to become contaminated or otherwise pose risks to patients. As a result, the agency recommended on June 25that AmEx Pharmacy voluntarily recall all unexpired drugs intended to be sterile and cease sterile operations until the company takes adequate corrective actions. However, AmEx Pharmacy declined to initiate a recall of all unexpired drugs intended to be sterile and has not provided adequate assurances regarding the sterility and quality of its remaining and newly manufactured products. Because of this, the agency today issued a to the outsourcing facility to recall all non-expired lots of drugs intended to be sterile. The FDA is also urging consumers to stop using these drugs and dispose of them immediately. Additionally, the agency is requesting the outsourcing facility cease production of drugs intended to be sterile until adequate remediation actions have been taken. Administration of a non-sterile drug intended to be sterile presents the risk of infection. Intraocular medications which are not sterile can lead to intraocular infections such as endophthalmitis which, depending on the infecting microorganism, can lead to a loss of partial or total permanent visual function (i.e., no light perception). Patients who have concerns about receiving any drug produced by AmEx Pharmacy or who observe signs of an infection after using these medicines should contact their health care professional. Health care professionals should immediately check their medical supplies, quarantine any drugs intended to be sterile and prepared by AmEx Pharmacy, and not administer or provide them to patients. The FDA urges health care professionals who obtained drugs from AmEx Pharmacy to make alternative arrangements to obtain medications from sources that adhere to proper quality standards. “Although compounded drugs can serve an important need for some patients, they present a higher risk because they do not undergo premarket review to ensure that they are safe and effective for their intended use and to verify their manufacturing quality,” said Donald D. Ashley, director of compliance for the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The agency’s compounding program aims to protect patients from unsafe, ineffective and poor-quality compounded drugs, while preserving access to compounded drugs for patients for whom an FDA-approved drug is not medically appropriate.” The FDA has received reports of adverse events associated with the use of AmEx Pharmacy’s drugs. The FDA encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse events to the AmEx Pharmacy is registered as an under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

{"title": "Remarks prepared for testimony before a U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on FDA Regulation of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems and Investigation of Vaping Illnesses", "date": "September 25, 2019", "contents": " Good morning, Chairwoman DeGette, Ranking Member Guthrie, and Members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the regulation of electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, and the Agency’s role in the ongoing investigation into lung injuries experienced by individuals who use vaping products. As you know, prior to coming to FDA, I was Director of the NCI, and I’m a long-time cancer doctor. My experience treating patients has informed all of my work at the agency including the issues before the committee today. We are here to discuss two top priority issues: first, the ongoing investigation into the cause of lung injury associated with the use of vaping products. Second, FDA’s ongoing efforts to address an epidemic of youth use of ENDS products; including the Administration’s recent announcement about our intention to issue a policy that would address ongoing marketing of flavored ENDS products. Let me start by discussing the vaping illness outbreak. Working with state partners, FDA and CDC have been investigating an outbreak of severe lung injury associated with the use of vaping products. Most cases have reported recent use of vaping products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Although these cases seem similar, it is not clear if they have a common cause, or if they have differing pathogenesis with similar presentation. The investigation has not identified any specific substance or product that is linked to all cases. Let me outline the main components of our investigation. FDA’s Office of Emergency Operations has activated an Incident Management Group to coordinate across the agency and works alongside CDC’s Incident Management System. FDA’s regulatory field force is playing a critical role in fact-gathering and analysis. With State health departments, we are collecting samples for analysis at our Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC). The FCC is using state-of-the-art methods to assess the presence of a broad range of chemicals including nicotine; THC and other cannabinoids; opioids; cutting agents and other additives; pesticides, and toxins. Additionally, we are working with Customs and Border Protection to identify illicit vaping products at the International Mail Facilities. FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations is focused on identifying the products that are making people ill and following the supply chain to the source. FDA is not pursuing any actions associated with personal use of any vaping products, our interest is in the suppliers. But to be clear, if we determine that someone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that caused illness and death for personal profit, we would consider that to be a criminal act. Because many of the products associated with cases contain THC oils, we have engaged the DEA to help with our investigation. Now let me turn to FDA’s efforts to address the disturbing rate of ENDS use by kids. This summer, working with CDC, the Agency received preliminary data from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). Despite strong compliance and education strategies, the 2019 data indicate another alarming increase in youth use of ENDS products. FDA’s response to the 2018 NYTS data was aggressive and multi-pronged. We stepped up compliance and enforcement efforts by issuing warning letters and civil monetary penalties to retailers for sales of ENDS to minors. We collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission to remove kid appealing products from the market, and pursued ENDS manufacturers employing unlawful online posts by social media influencers. Most recently, we issued a warning letter to JUUL Labs Inc. for marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products, including in a presentation to children given at a school. We also expanded our efforts to educate youth about the dangers of e-cigarette use. Our Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign, the Real Cost, is a comprehensive effort targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17. Despite these significant efforts, the 2019 NYTS preliminary data, as well as another study supported by NIDA, demonstrate a continued rise in the disturbing rates of youth e-cigarette use, especially through the use of non-tobacco flavors. In particular, these data show that more than a quarter of high school students were current e-cigarette users in 2019 and youth e-cigarette users cited fruit and menthol/mint flavors as being the most popular. In short: the data indicate that FDA must do more. That’s why the President announced his support for the FDA’s intention to soon finalize a compliance policy related to flavored ENDS. This policy would prioritize FDA’s enforcement of premarket authorization requirements for non-tobacco flavors. FDA is not ‘banning’ flavors, as has been described in some news reports. Rather, FDA intends to enforce existing law that limits the marketing of such products. This policy would not mean that flavored e-cigarettes could never be marketed. If a company can show through an application to FDA that a specific product meets the standard set forth by Congress, then the FDA would authorize that ENDS product for sale. FDA intends to prioritize enforcement action such that flavored e-cigarette products will be expected to exit the market unless and until manufacturers of these products provide scientific evidence demonstrating that marketing their products is appropriate for the protection of the public health. I want to assure the subcommittee that I am firmly committed to employing all of the tools at FDA’s disposal to tackle these problems. We will not rest until we have answers to the questions in the investigation, and until we have dramatically reduced the access and appeal of e-cigarettes to kids. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on new steps to advance digital health policies that encourage innovation and enable efficient and modern regulatory oversight", "date": "September 26, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a suite of guidances to continue to encourage innovative approaches to the development of digital health tools, and to ensure the agency’s approach to overseeing these technologies advances along with it. Patients, their families and their health care professionals are increasingly embracing digital health technologies to inform everyday decisions, from tools that more easily report blood glucose levels to smart watches that can detect atrial fibrillation. These tools provide patients with a wealth of easily-accessible information that can help them make better and more efficient decisions, take steps to improve their lifestyles and health choices, and experience better outcomes. We believe that an appropriate regulatory framework that takes into account the realities of how technology advances plays a crucial role in the efficient development of digital health technologies. We’ve maintained, since we issued our in 2017, that our approach to regulating these novel, swiftly evolving products must foster, not inhibit, innovation. Our plan outlined our efforts to reimagine the FDA’s approach to ensure all Americans have timely access to high-quality, safe and effective digital health products. As part of this plan, we’ve accomplished several key initiatives, including the digital health software precertification pilot program (“Pre-Cert”) and taking steps to modernize our policies. The guidances issued today continue those efforts announced as part of the Digital Health Innovation Action Plan and address key provisions of the , that offer additional clarity about where the FDA sees its role in advancing safe and effective digital health technologies. We’ve taken the goals we were entrusted with by Congress under the Cures Act and are building on these provisions to make sure that we’re adopting the full spirit of the intent to provide a practical oversight framework that is risk based. The first guidance we’re announcing, , is a revised draft guidance based on careful review of public comments received on the previous draft published in 2017. We recognize that software that provides clinical decision support (CDS) has many uses, including helping providers, and ultimately patients, identify the most appropriate treatment plan for their disease or condition. An example of CDS could be software that analyzes family history, electronic health record data, prescription patterns and geographical data in order to help health care professionals identify patients who may be at risk for opioid addiction. These types of software programs are intended to inform the physician’s clinical management of their patient. This technology has enormous potential to improve clinical decision making. We want to encourage developers to create, adapt and expand the functionalities of their software to support providers in diagnosing and treating diseases, while also ensuring the software doesn’t introduce unacceptable risk to the patient. After first publishing the draft guidance in 2017, the agency received feedback from many stakeholders advising us on improvements that could be made to better clarify the agency’s oversight of CDS products. We heard you and worked to incorporate that important feedback. More specifically, stakeholders asked that the FDA consider the inclusion of risk-based categorization of software products based on the risk to patients if a software product malfunctions, so we’ve leveraged the (IMDRF) risk-based framework for categorizing products. The IMDRF final document, “ ,” progressing from our international harmonization efforts, establishes common principles that can be used by all stakeholders, including regulators, to promote safe innovation and protect patient safety. The draft guidance clarifies categories of CDS that would be subject to FDA oversight, categories of CDS for which we intend not to enforce applicable regulatory requirements (known as enforcement discretion) due to the software’s low risk to patients, and CDS categories that do not meet the definition of a medical device. In this draft guidance, we propose to focus our regulatory oversight on CDS functions that are intended to help health care professionals and patients inform their clinical management for serious or critical conditions and that are not intended for health care professionals to independently evaluate the basis of the software’s recommendations. An example of a product we would focus our oversight on would be CDS that identifies hospitalized, type 1 diabetic patients at increased risk of postoperative cardiovascular events and which does not explain why the software made that identification to the health care professional. In this case, if the CDS provides information that is not accurate (e.g., inappropriately identifies a patient as low risk when he is high risk), then any misidentification could lead to inappropriate treatment and patient harm. Since the potential for patient harm is significant, FDA regulation plays an important role in evaluating the software’s safety and effectiveness. We believe our proposed approach for regulating CDS not only fulfills the provisions of the Cures Act, but also strikes the right balance between ensuring patient safety and promoting innovation by clarifying which products would be the focus of FDA’s oversight and which would not. Also issued today was the final guidance which addresses other digital health provisions included in the Cures Act. Specifically, this final guidance outlines the FDA’s interpretation of the types of software that are no longer considered medical devices under the amended definition of device. We’re making clear that certain digital health technologies – such as mobile apps that are intended only for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle – generally fall outside the scope of the FDA’s regulation. Such technologies tend to pose a low risk to patients, but can provide great value to consumers and the healthcare system. The digital health technologies described in this guidance (3060) have been previously discussed in existing medical software guidances.  That’s why today we are also updating four previously issued FDA final guidances to align with interpretations and policies under the Cures Act: . Changes to these documents include clarification that many products previously under enforcement discretion no longer are medical devices under the 21st Century Cures Act, and therefore are not subject to FDA’s regulations and oversight. Overall, these important guidance documents being issued today expand on our efforts to both encourage innovation in the ever-changing field of digital health and protect the public health. Our aim is to provide more clarity on our risk-based approach to digital health products, and, in particular, to provide more detail on those technologies and applications that would no longer be classified as a medical device subject to FDA regulation according to the Cures Act. These documents are critical elements of FDA’s comprehensive approach to digital health.  We are committed to promoting beneficial innovation in this space while providing appropriate oversight where it’s merited. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

This recall is due to a , N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which was found in the recalled medicine. NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer). “The FDA is committed to ensuring that the medicines Americans take are safe and effective. We began testing ranitidine products immediately after we learned of the potential impurity. When we identify lapses in the quality of drugs that pose potential risks for patients, the FDA makes all efforts to understand the issue and provide our best recommendation to the public as quickly and accurately as possible,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We will continue to investigate and work to ensure these types of impurities do not exceed acceptable limits, so that patients can continue taking the medicines they need without concern.” Ranitidine is an over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drug. Ranitidine is a histamine-2 blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach. OTC ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid ingestion and sour stomach. Prescription ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The agency today provided the following information for patients and health care professionals on the recall of ranitidine capsules produced by Sandoz: “We are continuing our investigation along with our international counterparts, and we will keep the American public informed of any additional recalls as well as the potential risks from taking ranitidine products,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The agency is testing ranitidine products from multiple manufacturers and assessing the possible effect on patients who have been taking ranitidine, as well as what manufacturers can do to reduce or eliminate nitrosamine in drugs. As part of the FDA’s investigation, the agency recently posted a testing protocol, which can be used by regulators and industry to detect nitrosamine impurities in ranitidine. The FDA is asking companies to begin their own laboratory testing to examine levels of NDMA in ranitidine and to send samples of ranitidine to the FDA to be tested by agency scientists. The FDA and manufacturers of ranitidine will take appropriate measures based on the results of this ongoing investigation and the agency will provide additional information when it becomes available.

If a patient is taking one of the recalled medicines, they should follow the recall instructions provided by the company. This information is available on the FDA’s While the FDA investigates the root cause and risk, consumers and patients can continue to take ranitidine that has not been recalled. It is important to remember that not all ranitidine marketed in the U.S. is being recalled.

Multiple drugs are approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine. Consumers taking OTC ranitidine could consider using other OTC products for their condition."},
{"title": "Statement on continued efforts to increase availability of all forms of naloxone to help reduce opioid overdose deaths", "date": "September 20, 2019", "contents": " Addressing opioid overdose continues to be one of the most urgent public health priorities for the U.S. government and making potentially lifesaving treatments more readily available is one of the top ways we can address this crisis. As we observe Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, a time when we acknowledge the devastating toll the opioid crisis has inflicted on our country, we felt it was essential to clarify important information about naloxone, an emergency opioid overdose reversal treatment. Naloxone is a critical tool for individuals, families, first responders and communities to help reduce opioid overdose deaths. Access to naloxone, however, continues to be limited in some communities. There are three FDA-approved forms of naloxone – injectable, auto-injector and nasal spray – and all three currently require a prescription, which can be a barrier for people who aren’t under the care of a health care provider or who are apprehensive about admitting to issues with substance abuse. However, in response to the crisis, most states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that allow pharmacists to dispense naloxone under a standing order, which takes the place of an individual prescription. Some states also have given pharmacists direct authority to prescribe and sell naloxone to consumers. Still, many pharmacists may be unaware of the standing orders and direct authority in their states or are unwilling to provide all forms of naloxone to consumers without an individual prescription. There is also a persistent misunderstanding that the FDA-approved labeling for the injectable form of naloxone, the least expensive option, precludes administration outside a health care setting. This has created confusion among public health officials and community-based organizations about whether the injectable form of naloxone can be used as part of their distribution programs. The FDA-approved product labeling for the three forms of naloxone does not exclude dispensing by pharmacies or community distribution programs. All three forms of naloxone are FDA-approved and may be considered as options for community distribution and use by individuals with or without medical training to stop or reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. The FDA is working with other federal, state and local officials as well as health care providers, patients and communities across the country to increase availability of all forms of naloxone and combat the toll to communities, individuals and the economy resulting from opioid abuse and addiction. As we continue to confront the opioid crisis, several efforts are underway at the FDA to make naloxone more readily available and accessible. In April, we approved the , a generic of the brand product, Narcan. The FDA is also granting priority review to all generic applications for products that can be used as emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose. As part of the priority review, sponsors will receive shorter goal dates or standard goal dates with earlier reviewer deadlines; enhanced agency communication with sponsors; and expanded agency engagement, such as pre-submission and mid-cycle meetings. Making naloxone more widely available in every pharmacy as an approved over-the-counter (OTC) product would also be an important public health advancement – one we have been working on at the FDA. In January, we took an unprecedented step in helping to encourage development of . To encourage drug companies to enter the OTC market, the FDA designed, tested and validated the key labeling requirements necessary to approve an OTC version of naloxone. To do this, we developed a model Drug Facts label (DFL) with pictogram instructions so anyone with access to the drug can better understand how to administer it. To ensure the pictograms are easy to understand, we also conducted label comprehension testing with consumers. This was the first time the FDA proactively developed and tested a DFL to support development of an OTC product. With one of the key components for OTC availability now in place, drug companies can use this information as part of an application to obtain approval for OTC naloxone. We are continuing to work with industry partners who are interested in developing these OTC naloxone products. The FDA also held a in December 2018 on various options for increasing access to naloxone, weighing logistical, social and economic aspects of this important issue. There was overwhelming support from meeting participants to remove barriers to obtaining naloxone, particularly OTC naloxone, and to support community activities that expand its availability. As a result, we are currently exploring more ways to increase the availability of all forms of naloxone, such as working with manufacturers to see if shelf-life extensions for naloxone products are possible; conducting additional research on naloxone; and considering situations where co-prescribing of naloxone may be appropriate including possible updated product labeling. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has ongoing efforts to fight the opioid crisis and expand the use of naloxone. In April 2017, the department announced a to Combat the Opioids Crisis, including better targeting of overdose reversing drugs. In April 2018, Surgeon General VADM Jerome Adams issued an encouraging more individuals, including family, friends and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose to carry naloxone. In December 2018, Adm. Brett Giroir, M.D., Assistant Secretary for Health and the Secretary’s Senior Advisor for Opioid Policy, released for health care professionals and patients detailing how naloxone can help save lives Ultimately, the goal of increasing access to all forms of naloxone is to make this potentially life-saving treatment available to individuals at risk of an overdose – such as those with a history of overdose or substance use disorder – and those in the community most likely to observe an overdose. The FDA remains committed to using its regulatory authority to address this crisis, working with all our partners to expand the availability of all forms of naloxone, and encouraging prescribers and patients to discuss this topic. All together, these efforts have the potential to put a vital tool for combatting opioid overdose in the hands of those who need it most – friends and family of opioid users, as well as first responders and community-based organizations. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on final guidance to help advance development of novel treatments for ALS", "date": "September 23, 2019", "contents": " Over the past few years we’ve witnessed new medical breakthroughs that are altering how diseases are treated in ways that seemed unimaginable just a decade ago. We recognize that scientific progress across different disease and therapeutic areas has been uneven, particularly lagging for complex neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In part, this is because the underlying causes of severe neurological diseases are often not well understood, contributing to the challenge in the development of drug and biological treatments. Despite years of research and the availability of some approved therapies, we know the lack of new treatments for ALS is deeply frustrating for patients and caregivers. Staff from the FDA have been meeting regularly with members of the ALS community, including patients, their families and caregivers, and have heard their concerns loud and clear. We recognize the kind of strength it takes to battle ALS every day and the critical, unmet medical need that exists. The FDA has a long-standing commitment to working with researchers, drug companies and the patient community to facilitate the development and approval of new products to treat ALS. To further support that effort, today the FDA issued a final guidance for industry, . The final guidance provides industry with the FDA’s current scientific thinking so that effective treatments with a favorable benefit to risk profile can be most efficiently developed, studied and ultimately made available to patients. It is the result of collaboration among experts across the agency and incorporates important input from patients, researchers and advocates. We appreciate the many thoughtful comments submitted to the docket for the draft guidance and other feedback we received. We carefully reviewed and considered all comments as we developed this final guidance. The final guidance includes up-to-date information on our recommendations to help advance the development of products for ALS patients, including recommendations on clinical trial design and ways to measure effectiveness. We know that an important element of product development is working early and often with researchers and companies to help facilitate their clinical development programs. That’s why our final guidance recommends that researchers and companies interact with the FDA early in product development so that we can best advise on proposed development programs and the efficient design of trials to produce the data needed for FDA approval in order to get effective therapies to patients as efficiently as possible. Because this guidance presents non-binding recommendations for the FDA and sponsors, the FDA is open to considering alternative approaches to meeting our requirements for approval. Specific to clinical trial design, this final guidance provides clarity around some of the questions raised by stakeholders. It emphasizes that all patients in ALS trials should receive the best standard of care, and no patient should be denied effective therapies in order to be randomized to a placebo-only arm. While exposure to placebo may be the best way to determine the effectiveness of some products, the guidance also explains various strategies that can be applied to minimize unnecessary exposure to placebo and expedite trials, such as master protocols, adaptive designs and enrichment strategies. ALS patients deserve effective treatments, just as patients with any other disease or condition do. The statutory standards for effectiveness apply to drugs and biologics for ALS just as the standards apply for all other drugs and biologics. However, the FDA has long stressed the appropriateness of exercising regulatory flexibility in applying the statutory standards to medical products for serious diseases with unmet medical needs, while preserving appropriate assurance that they are effective and have a favorable benefit to risk profile. As such, we stand ready to use the available to help bring new treatments for ALS to patients as quickly as possible. We also know that many patients with ALS are seeking access to investigational products for this devastating disease. The FDA remains committed to helping patients and health care professionals evaluate options for accessing investigational products, such as participating in a clinical trial, obtaining access to an unapproved, investigational product outside of a clinical trial through or providing information for patients about the . However, it’s important to note that for a patient to receive a treatment under expanded access or Right to Try, the manufacturer or sponsor must be willing to provide it. Additionally, we encourage sponsors to offer access to investigational products after clinical trials are complete when continued access to a promising medicine would be appropriate under the expanded access program. The FDA is generally prohibited by law from releasing confidential information about investigational products, so we ask that companies developing treatments for ALS provide information about the status of their research and information on availability of products under expanded access or Right to Try so that patients, caregivers and physicians can have informed discussions. For outcomes associated with use under expanded access, as explained in , FDA reviewers understand that assessment of any serious adverse event must consider the context in which the investigational drug or biologic is provided. We want to reassure sponsors that providing a drug under expanded access very rarely impacts development timelines. Patients are at the forefront of everything we do. That’s why the aim of issuing this final guidance is to help foster the availability of treatments. The FDA remains deeply committed to supporting the ALS community in its efforts to fight the toll that this devastating disease takes on all those affected. The FDA looks forward to continuing our dialogue with the ALS community, and is looking into how to proceed with additional meetings that will best facilitate this engagement."},
{"title": "FDA approves first live, non-replicating vaccine to prevent smallpox and monkeypox", "date": "September 24, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today the approval of Jynneos Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Non-Replicating, for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. This is the only currently FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of monkeypox disease. “Following the global Smallpox Eradication Program, the World Health Organization certified the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox disease in 1980. Routine vaccination of the American public was stopped in 1972 after the disease was eradicated in the U.S. and, as a result, a large proportion of the U.S., as well as the global population has no immunity,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Therefore, although naturally occurring smallpox disease is no longer a global threat, the intentional release of this highly contagious virus could have a devastating effect. Today’s approval reflects the U.S. government’s commitment to preparedness through support for the development of safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and other medical countermeasures.” Jynneos will be available for those determined to be at high risk of either smallpox or monkeypox infection. This vaccine is also part of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), the nation’s largest supply of potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency that is severe enough to cause local supplies to be depleted. The availability of this vaccine in the SNS will help ensure that the vaccine is accessible in the U.S. if needed. Smallpox, which is caused by the variola virus, emerged in human populations thousands of years ago and is a highly contagious and often fatal infectious disease. A person infected with smallpox typically develops a rash characterized by raised pocks on the face and body. The smallpox virus is spread through saliva and droplets from the respiratory tract or by direct or indirect contact with the virus as it is shed from skin lesions. The virus can also be spread through other body fluids and contaminated clothing or bed linen. If a person is infected with smallpox and they are in close contact with others, the virus can spread quickly. Monkeypox, which does not occur naturally in the U.S., is a rare disease caused by infection with monkeypox virus, which causes symptoms similar to, but milder than, smallpox. Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion and can be fatal, even though it is typically milder than smallpox. It is transmitted to people from various wild animals, such as rodents and primates. In 2003, the U.S. experienced an outbreak of monkeypox, which was the first time human monkeypox was reported outside of Africa. Jynneos does not contain the viruses that cause smallpox or monkeypox. It is made from a vaccinia virus, a virus that is closely related to, but less harmful than, variola or monkeypox viruses and can protect against both of these diseases. Jynneos contains a modified form of the vaccinia virus called Modified Vaccinia Ankara, which does not cause disease in humans and is non-replicating, meaning it cannot reproduce in human cells. The effectiveness of Jynneos for the prevention of smallpox was determined in a clinical study comparing the immune responses in study participants who received either Jynneos or ACAM2000, an FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of smallpox. The study included approximately 400 healthy adults, 18 through 42 years of age who had never been vaccinated for smallpox, in which half of the study participants received two doses of Jynneos administered 28 days apart, and half received one dose of ACAM2000. The group vaccinated with Jynneos had an immune response that was not inferior to immune responses to ACAM2000. Vaccine effectiveness for the prevention of smallpox was also inferred from supportive animal studies that showed prior vaccination with Jynneos protected non-human primates who were exposed to viruses related to the smallpox virus. The effectiveness of Jynneos for the prevention of monkeypox disease is inferred from the antibody responses in the smallpox clinical study participants and from studies in non-human primates that showed protection of animals vaccinated with Jynneos who were exposed to the monkeypox virus. The safety of Jynneos was assessed in more than 7,800 individuals who received at least one dose of the vaccine. The most commonly reported side effects were pain, redness, swelling, itching, firmness at the injection site, muscle pain, headache and fatigue. No safety concerns that would require a Medication Guide have been identified for Jynneos. Jynneos is administered in two doses given four weeks apart. The FDA granted the approval of Jynneos to Bavarian Nordic A/S. The FDA granted the application and with this approval, the FDA issued a material threat medical countermeasure (MCM) priority review voucher to Bavarian Nordic A/S. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the 21st Century Cures (Cures) Act, authorizes the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of approved material threat MCM product applications that meet certain criteria. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement on FDA efforts to encourage patient engagement in medical device clinical investigations", "date": "September 23, 2019", "contents": " At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration we are committed to keeping patients, their families and caregivers at the center of our work and to deepening their involvement in how we review medical device applications. We value patient experience and insights about living with a disease, like diabetes or end-stage renal disease, as well as any impact a medical device—such as a glucose monitor or hemodialysis system—has had in a patient’s diagnosis, treatment and management of that disease. Patient experiences and insight can help us understand the benefits most important to patients and what risks patients may or may not be willing to tolerate. How medical devices are tested to determine a favorable benefit/risk profile is at the core of our medical device evaluations, and the patient voice provides important value in that process. Typically, medical device developers work with health care providers, clinical researchers and the FDA to design and test medical devices to understand how the product will benefit patients, but the process often does not incorporate direct input from patients. Without patient input in the design and conduct of the clinical investigation, outcomes important to patients may not be captured, clinical visits may become overly burdensome and study enrollment could be negatively impacted. This can lead to increased time to conduct trials and increased burden to study participants and the health care system, resulting in delays in patient access to potentially lifesaving medical devices. I believe that when we engage patients, their families and caregivers, throughout the medical device clinical investigation process, we will have more patient-centric clinical investigations and ultimately timely access to innovative, safe and effective medical devices. But, we recognize that encouraging patients to participate and complete clinical trials can be challenging. That is why, today, we are releasing draft guidance on . This draft guidance provides our proposed recommendations for manufacturers to engage patients in multiple aspects of medical device clinical investigation design. The draft guidance is a reflection of our extensive work to engage patients into our medical product regulatory processes, which has grown since 1991 when the FDA first began including patient perspective in FDA Advisory Committee meetings, and continues today through our (PEAC). Launched in 2017, the PEAC is our first advisory committee whose members are solely patients, caregivers and those who represent their needs. Through PEAC, our Center for Devices and Radiological Health works with a diverse group of patient organizations to encourage the inclusion of patient perspectives across the total medical device life cycle, from the design and ideation of the medical device to the clinical investigation process, and through to post market monitoring. Patient preference study design, benefit-risk determinations, device labeling, unmet clinical needs, available alternatives, patient reported outcomes and device-related quality of life or health status issues are among the topics that may be considered by the Committee. It’s particularly exciting that today’s draft guidance is a direct result of the first PEAC meeting, which focused on ways to improve clincal trial design and improve recruitment, enrollment and retention in trials. As an outcome of that meeting, the PEAC recommended the FDA work with industry to develop a framework clarifying how patient advisors can engage in the clinical investigation process. Patient advisors have experience living with a disease or condition and can be an advisor to improve the clinical investigation design and conduct, but they are not participating in the clinical investigation themselves. We provide proposed recommendations in the draft guidance on approaches sponsors might use to engage with patient advisors and outline some patient engagement activities that may enhance the design and conduct of clinical investigations. For example, patient advisors can help sponsors improve informed consent documents, so patients better understand the information being presented to them. Drawing from their personal experience, patient advisors can weigh in on outcomes that matter most to them to inform potential endpoints that are clinically meaningful in the treatment of a specific disease or condition. We look forward to feedback from the patient community and sponsors on this draft guidance as it will help inform us as we continue to work with sponsors to ensure they integrate patient input into clinical investigations and other aspects of the regulatory process. The FDA has also created engagement mechanisms to provide timely input from patients on what it is like to live with their disease or condition and/or interface with a medical device. One such effort is the program. Established in 2018, the pilot program was recently launched this summer and provides a formal process for FDA reviewers to engage with patients and patient organizations to obtain input on key issues when they are evaluating a medical device submission. This program allows us to broaden our exposure to patient experiences through patient organizations to address specific questions pertaining to their diagnosis and/or treatment. Along with today’s draft guidance, the Patient and Caregiver Connection program builds on our strong commitment to patients, who are our most important customers. When we work with patients early-on, we can advance the development and evaluation of innovative medical devices. Patient-centric clinical investigations may improve efficiency and quality in the design and conduct of clinical investigations ensuring that sponsors can enroll and retain patients and collect information that is more meaningful to patients. This may lead to greater uptake of results by patients and providers when making treatment decisions and, ultimately, to earlier U.S. patient access to innovative, safe and effective medical devices. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA issues proposed rule for premarket tobacco product applications as part of commitment to continuing strong oversight of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products", "date": "September 20, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued rule to set forth requirements related to the content, format and FDA’s review and communications procedures for premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) as part of the agency’s continued commitment to its oversight of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. When finalized, this proposed rule will help to ensure that PMTAs contain sufficient information for evaluation such as details regarding the physical aspects of a tobacco product and information on the product’s potential public health benefits and harms. It also would codify the procedures by which the agency would review PMTAs and establish the requirements for manufacturers to maintain records related to the legal marketing status of their tobacco products. “Our review of premarket product applications will help evaluate the public health benefits and harms of a tobacco product to ensure that those authorized for marketing are appropriate for the protection of public health. This will include understanding the likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products – such as kids – will start using them, as well as the likelihood that tobacco users will stop. And as I’ve said before, responsible manufacturers certainly don’t need to wait to act. We encourage industry to use available FDA resources as a guide for their submissions to the agency,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “This proposed rule follows our announcement last week that we intend to finalize a compliance policy in the coming weeks that would prioritize enforcement to clear the market of unauthorized, non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products. These important regulatory actions are part of our ongoing oversight of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products that is critical to our public health mission and, especially, to protecting kids from the dangers of nicotine addiction and tobacco-related disease and death.” , manufacturers or importers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product(s) would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That statutory standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. The agency’s evaluation also includes reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives, constituents, toxicological profile and health impact, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and labeled. In July, a U.S. District Court judge in Maryland requiring that manufacturers submit premarket applications by May 12, 2020, for deemed tobacco products, including e-cigarette products, that were on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016. Manufacturers may refer to available resources such as the issued this past June for manufacturers of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems who will need to prepare PMTA applications. The agency will continue to work efficiently to issue a final rule in a timely manner; however, the final rule need not be in place for manufacturers to continue submitting PMTAs to the agency. In addition to content and format requirements, the proposed rule would codify the general procedures the FDA would follow when evaluating PMTAs, including application acceptance, application filing and inspections. Additionally, the proposed rule would establish PMTA-related requirements for filing amendments to an application, the time for review, withdrawal of applications, changes in ownership, post-market reporting and maintenance of records, FDA communications with an applicant, FDA’s disclosure procedures and electronic submission requirements. This proposed rule also explains how applicants may submit a supplemental PMTA or a resubmission, which would reduce the burden of submitting and reviewing a standard PMTA in certain situations. A supplemental PMTA could be submitted when an applicant is seeking authorization for a new tobacco product that is a modified version of a tobacco product for which they have already received a PMTA marketing order. In addition, an applicant could resubmit a PMTA when seeking to address application deficiencies following the issuance of a “No Marketing Order.” The proposed rule also establishes certain recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers regarding the legal marketing status of certain tobacco products without a PMTA, such as documents showing that a tobacco product is not required to undergo premarket review (grandfathered) or has previously received premarket authorization. The proposed rule will be open for public comments for 60 days through November 25, 2019. The FDA continues to publish resources and hold meetings to better inform and assist manufacturers with the premarket application process. For example, in October, the agency is to discuss policies, processes, and general scientific principles related to tobacco product marketing applications with a focus on deemed tobacco products such as cigars, waterpipes, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). The agency recently published a for manufacturers submitting applications through the PMTA pathway for ENDS, such as e-cigarettes, “vape” products and the liquid nicotine and nicotine-containing e-liquids used with such products. The agency has also issued a proposed rule on , and has conducted describing, among other things, the statutory requirements for premarket applications. The FDA will continue efforts to provide resources for industry to comply with federal tobacco regulations through online information, meetings, webinars and guidance documents.

{"title": "FDA approves first oral GLP-1 treatment for type 2 diabetes", "date": "September 20, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Rybelsus (semaglutide) oral tablets to improve control of blood sugar in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. Rybelsus is the first glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor protein treatment approved for use in the United States that does not need to be injected. GLP-1 drugs are non-insulin treatments for people with type 2 diabetes. “Patients want effective treatment options for diabetes that are as minimally intrusive on their lives as possible, and the FDA welcomes the advancement of new therapeutic options that can make it easier for patients to control their condition,” said Lisa Yanoff, M.D, acting director of the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Before this approval, patients did not have an oral GLP1 option to treat their type 2 diabetes, and now patients will have a new option for treating type 2 diabetes without injections.” Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, occurring when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep blood sugar at normal levels. GLP-1, which is a normal body hormone, is often found in insufficient levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Like GLP-1, Rybelsus slows digestion, prevents the liver from making too much sugar, and helps the pancreas produce more insulin when needed. The efficacy and safety of Rybelsus in reducing blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes were studied in several clinical trials, two of which were placebo-controlled and several of which were compared to other GLP-1 injection treatments. Rybelsus was studied as a stand-alone therapy and in combination with other diabetes treatments, including metformin, sulfonylureas (insulin secretagogues), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, insulins and thiazolidinediones, all in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the placebo-controlled studies, Rybelsus as a stand-alone therapy resulted in a significant reduction in blood sugar (hemoglobin A1c) compared with placebo, as determined through HbA1c tests, which measure average levels of blood sugar over time. After 26 weeks, 69% of those taking 7 mg once daily and 77% of those taking 14 mg once daily of Rybelsus decreased their HbA1c to lower than 7%, compared with 31% of patients on placebo. The prescribing information for Rybelsus includes a boxed warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the potential increased risk of thyroid c-cell tumors, and that Rybelsus is not recommended as the first choice of medicine for treating diabetes. Patients who have ever had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or who have a family member who has ever had MTC are advised not to use Rybelsus. Additionally, patients who have ever had an endocrine system condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) are advised not to use Rybelsus. Rybelsus is not for use in patients with type 1 diabetes and people with diabetic ketoacidosis. Rybelsus also has warnings about pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), diabetic retinopathy (damage to the eye’s retina), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), acute kidney injury and hypersensitivity reactions. It is not known whether Rybelsus can be used by patients who have had pancreatitis. The risk of hypoglycemia increased when Rybelsus was used in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin. Rybelsus should be taken at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage or other oral medication of the day, with no more than 4 ounces of plain water. Rybelsus slows digestion, so patients should discuss other medications they are taking with their health care provider before starting Rybelsus. The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, indigestion and constipation. The approval of Rybelsus was granted to Novo Nordisk. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for children with rare diseases that cause inflammation of small blood vessels", "date": "September 27, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Rituxan (rituximab) injection to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in children 2 years of age and older in combination with glucocorticoids (steroid hormones). It is the first approved treatment for children with these rare vasculitis diseases, in which a patient’s small blood vessels become inflamed, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through them. This can cause serious problems and damage to organs, most notably the lungs and the kidneys. It also can impact the sinuses and skin. “The Rituxan application for pediatric GPA and MPA was approved under a priority review, and with orphan designation, to fulfil an unmet medical need for these rare and serious diseases. Rituxan provides a treatment option that has not existed until now for children who suffer from these diseases,” said Nikolay Nikolov, M.D., associate director for rheumatology of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The safety profile in pediatric patients with GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, and MPA was consistent in type, nature and severity with the known safety profile of Rituxan in adult patients with autoimmune diseases, including GPA and MPA. The pediatric clinical trial consisted of 25 patients ages 6 to 17 years with active GPA and MPA who were treated with Rituxan or non-U.S.-licensed rituximab in an international multicenter, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled study. All patients were given methylprednisolone prior to starting treatment. During the clinical trial, after a 6-month remission induction phase where patients were treated only with Rituxan or non-U.S.-licensed rituximab and glucocorticoids, patients who had not achieved remission – or who had progressive disease or an uncontrolled flare-up (when disease symptoms suddenly worsen) – could receive additional treatment, including other therapies, at the discretion of the investigator. In total, 14 of the patients were in remission at the 6-month mark. After 18 months, all 25 patients were in remission. Additional pharmacokinetic (exposure) and safety information supported the use of Rituxan in patients 2 years to 5 years of age with GPA/MPA. The most common side effects in the pediatric study were infections, infusion-related reactions and nausea. Hypogammaglobulinemia (reduced serum immunoglobulin levels) has also been observed in pediatric GPA and MPA patients treated with the study products. The most common side effects of Rituxan are infections, infusion-related reactions, abnormally low level of lymphocytes in the blood (lymphopenia) and anemia. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients for tumor lysis syndrome (a treatment complication where tumor cells are killed off at the same time and released into the bloodstream), cardiac adverse reactions, damage to kidneys (renal toxicity), and bowel obstruction and perforation (small hole formation). The doctor and patient information for Rituxan contains a boxed warning to draw attention to increased risks of the following: fatal infusion reactions; potentially fatal severe skin and mouth reactions; hepatitis B virus reactivation that may cause serious liver problems, including liver failure and death; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a rare, serious brain infection that can result in severe disability or death. This product must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that provides important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Rituxan was approved to treat adult patients with GPA and MPA in 2011. It is also approved to treat four additional diseases, first gaining approval to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1997. Rituxan received designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. Rituxan also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Rituxan to Genentech.

{"title": "Statement on continued efforts to evaluate materials in medical devices to address potential safety questions", "date": "September 30, 2019", "contents": " Innovation in medical devices, spurred in many cases by advances in materials sciences, continues to improve the lives of patients. The growing number of available materials used in today’s medical devices ‒ such as metal, plastic, silicone, animal-derived products or some combination of these ‒ reflects continued evolution in this field that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has routinely worked to evaluate as part of our ongoing commitment to foster safety and innovation to ensure that patients have access to safe and effective medical devices. As part of our role in protecting patients, our staff regularly evaluates and monitors scientific evidence, as well as adverse event reports, to learn more about risks from devices—including those that may be related to the materials used in devices. In the case of medical device implants where materials may come into contact with tissue or other parts of the body for extended periods of time, we evaluate during our premarket review the potential adverse biological response that could result from contact of the device’s component materials with the body. Today we’re announcing the next steps the agency is taking as part of its ongoing work to better evaluate the safety of specific materials used in medical devices. This includes holding our first public advisory committee meeting to convene experts and the public on this issue and providing new information on scientific evidence pertaining to specific materials—metals and metal alloys—used in medical devices. As we shared , we are evaluating the growing body of evidence that suggests a small number of patients who receive medical device implants may have biological responses to certain types of materials in those devices, such as inflammatory reactions and tissue changes that cause pain and fatigue. Importantly, the majority of patients using medical devices, including medical device implants, do not have adverse reactions and rely on their devices to help manage their health or treat their symptoms. We are continuing our efforts to determine how to better identify patients who might be at increased risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity response before they receive a metal-containing implant, so that they, along with their health care providers can better consider those risks along with the device’s benefits. To further understand how a patient responds to materials used in medical device implants and improve the safety of devices in patients, the FDA is working to engage the public—in particular, scientists, patients, and health care providers—as well as industry stakeholders to determine the current state of the science, critical gaps in the existing science and what approaches should be considered. As part of this broader work, today, we are announcing an of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee to be held Nov. 13-14, 2019, to discuss metal-containing implants and dental amalgams. Specifically, the panel will be looking at the potential for certain patients who receive medical device implants that contain select metal or metal alloys to develop immune and inflammatory reactions and whether current approaches and standards for biocompatibility are adequate. The panel may provide input on additional scientific information that the FDA should consider as part of premarket review and postmarket surveillance of metal-containing implants and dental amalgams. Additionally, the panel will also evaluate potential gaps in current scientific knowledge to help determine what additional studies may further our understanding as we look to strengthen the steps we’re taking to mitigate risks. One of the purposes of November’s public meeting is to discuss advances in the scientific community’s understanding of immunology and how related emerging and evolving scientific data may help address certain risks to specific patients. For example, this information may be useful in helping identify patients who are part of a small subset at increased risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity response to a device and ways in which this risk could be mitigated, whether by testing patients before they receive an implant, modifying device design, or other mechanisms. We believe this will help to ensure that patients and healthcare providers can make more informed decisions and fully discuss the benefits and risk of a device before it is used. Today, we have also posted two scientific reviews authored by FDA staffs background material ahead of the November meeting. The first summarizes the current scientific knowledge regarding different aspects of metal implants, including how the structure and function of these devices are impacted by the body’s tissues, muscles and blood supply and how the metal components wear over time and interact with the body’s immune cells. provides an updated assessment of the latest literature and data assessing potential risks reported to be associated with dental amalgam. We are interested in stakeholders’ perspectives on our recent review, as well as any new information that they may have to share, to help inform our understanding of the current benefit-risk profile of dental amalgam. We look forward to discussing and hearing feedback on these materials during the November public meeting. The FDA continues to believe that the benefits of metal or metal alloys in medical device implants outweigh the risks for most patients. However, we recognize that it is critical to closely monitor and evaluate new data as science is always evolving. We continue to explore ways to modernize the FDA’s review of medical device materials in an effort to support safety and innovation in medical devices that can significantly improve patient health and quality of life while working to minimize the potential for patient risk. As we move forward, we’ll continue to gather input from patients, device manufacturers, researchers and physicians to learn more about their experiences, ideas, and feedback related to materials in medical devices. We’re committed to advancing new initiatives that are rooted in sound science with a focus on ensuring patient safety remains at the forefront.

{"title": "FDA and DEA warn website operators illegally selling opioids ", "date": "September 30, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have issued joint warning letters to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol, that are potentially dangerous. The warning letters issued to each of the networks state that they must immediately stop illegally selling these opioids to American consumers. This joint action demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to enhance interagency coordination to respond to the opioid crisis. “As the FDA works to forcefully tackle the opioid crisis on all fronts, we cannot allow rogue online pharmacies to continue to fuel the crisis by illegally offering opioids for sale and circumventing the important safeguards that have been put in place for opioids to help protect the public health,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Today’s effort is also noteworthy because while the FDA partners regularly with the DEA, this is the first time we have issued joint warning letters with them. This action further strengthens the warning to the operators of these websites. We remain committed to using all available regulatory and enforcement tools to stop the illicit flow of opioids online.” Patients who buy prescription medicines, including opioids, from illegal online pharmacies may be putting their health at risk because the products, while being marketed as authentic, may be counterfeit, contaminated, expired or otherwise unsafe. Additionally, several of these websites offer opioids online without a prescription, posing significant risks to patients. The FDA remains concerned that the easy availability of opioids online further fuels the crisis. As noted in the warning letters, these websites offer for sale opioids that are misbranded and unapproved new drugs, including unapproved tramadol, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition to health risks, illegal online pharmacies can pose other risks to consumers, including credit card fraud, identity theft and computer viruses. The networks also violated the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) by failing to register their online pharmacies with the DEA despite knowingly or intentionally advertising the sale of controlled substances, including opioids. The CSA has, among other provisions, requirements that must be met for controlled substances (including opioids) to be legally distributed and dispensed via the internet. For example, an entity must be registered with the DEA to specifically dispense controlled substances; none are currently registered with the DEA to dispense or distribute controlled substances online. “Issuing these warning letters is not only an effort to deter the availability of dangerous illegal opioids, but it is also a testament to the close cooperation between DEA and FDA,” said Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon. “We will continue to attack organizations that facilitate the sale of dangerous drugs, putting profit over public safety.” The illegal sale of these opioids is particularly concerning because the FDA-approved tramadol carries a boxed warning, the agency’s most prominent warning, indicating that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or even life-threatening side effects. The boxed warning for tramadol addresses risks including addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression (breathing problems) and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies). In addition, when taken with other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, tramadol’s use may result in coma or death. The networks receiving warning letters include: The FDA and DEA have requested responses from each of the companies within 15 working days. The companies are directed to inform each agency of the specific actions taken to address the violations noted in the warning letters. Companies that fail to correct the violations, as outlined in the warning letters, may be subject to legal enforcement action. Opioid addiction is an immense public health crisis. Addressing it is one of the FDA’s highest priorities and supports the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ . Illegal online pharmacies, drug dealers and others continue to use the internet to further their illicit distribution of opioids, where the risk of detection and repercussions is significantly reduced. The FDA has been active in combating the illegal online sales of opioids. In 2018 and in of this year, the FDA issued a similar series of warning letters. Earlier in 2019, the FDA hosted internet stakeholders and thought-leaders, government entities, academic researchers and advocacy groups at its second to discuss ways to collaboratively take stronger action in combatting the opioid crisis by reducing the illicit availability of opioids online. The second summit focused on collaboration with internet registries and registrars. The DEA also participated in the FDA’s Online Opioid Summits to explore more proactive approaches in collaboration with internet stakeholders to crack down on the illegal sales of opioids online. Topics that were addressed during the first summit included: research into the ease with which opioids can be purchased online and industry approaches to addressing opioids marketed online, followed by a roundtable discussion to identify gaps and new solutions. The FDA remains committed to addressing the national crisis of opioid addiction on all fronts, with a significant focus on decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies and opioids more resistant to abuse and misuse; and taking action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioids. The agency will also continue to evaluate how opioids currently on the market are used, in both medical and illicit settings, and take regulatory action where needed. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section attorneys assigned to the DEA’s Special Operations Division and Policy Unit assisted in drafting the warning letters sent to these websites. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on measuring the progress being made through implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act", "date": "September 30, 2019", "contents": " After a series of large-scale food safety problems almost a decade ago, Congress passed the U.S. , or FSMA, to shift our food safety system from one that focused primarily on responding to problems to a system that prevents them from happening in the first place. It was the most significant change to the food safety framework in decades and was an important step that gave the FDA new authorities to help fulfill our obligation to protect consumers. And now, as we embark on a , we know further enhancing compliance with the foundational FSMA requirements will be critical to our success. As the seven foundational rules of FSMA reach their compliance dates over the next several years, it’s important to begin to track their impact on the food safety system. To help us measure progress and continue to refine our implementation, the FDA has established a dashboard where we will publish metrics relating to implementation of the law. launched today is part of , which is one tool the FDA uses to monitor certain FDA programs through key performance measures and projects, and regularly updates to ensure transparency to the public. While we expect that it will take several years to establish trends in the data, the initial data show that since 2016, the majority of companies inspected are in compliance with the new requirements of the preventive control rules. Additional FDA data also show that overall, industry has improved the time it takes to move from identifying a recall event to initiating a voluntary recall, from an average of four days in 2016 to approximately two days in 2019. In fact, comparing the FSMA data with our recall data shows the bigger picture, demonstrating the effectiveness of preventive measures as food recalls once again have reached a At this point we cannot definitively say these are meaningful trends representative of the entire food industry. However, this is an encouraging start as industry, the FDA and our regulatory partners work together to improve food safety and protect consumers. The new dashboard introduces metrics for food safety outcomes, associated measures and initial data for certain aspects of FSMA. Over time, the Food Safety Dashboard will be populated with additional data to show more FSMA outcomes and, we hope, an overall reduction in foodborne illnesses attributable to FDA-regulated food products. The initial metrics are tracking outcomes in the areas of inspections and recalls for three FSMA rules. They include: The data released today only provide a snapshot of both domestic and foreign industry compliance with these regulations. Many factors will influence these data over time, especially in the early phases of implementation. For instance, some of the rules feature staggered compliance dates based on size of business to allow smaller businesses more time to comply. The data will ultimately help the agency identify trends in food safety, continue to improve our risk-based food safety framework, and modernize the agency’s food safety approaches in a way that will help prepare us for a New Era of Smarter Food Safety. Publishing these metrics today is part of our commitment to greater transparency and accountability for all stakeholders responsible for improving the safety of the food supply. We plan to update the data for these three FSMA rules quarterly, with our goal being to ultimately publish metrics for all seven rules. We know that we can’t stop every outbreak of foodborne illness; however, reducing the incidence of illness and death attributed to contaminated food is a shared goal of growers, manufacturers, packers, suppliers, importers and regulators alike. This goal can be realized through the successful implementation of FSMA and modernizing our approaches to food safety from farm to fork. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA informs patients, providers and manufacturers about potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities for connected medical devices and health care networks that use certain communication software", "date": "October 01, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is patients, health care professionals, IT staff in health care facilities and manufacturers of a set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, referred to as “URGENT/11,” that—if exploited by a remote attacker—may introduce risks for medical devices and hospital networks. URGENT/11 affects several operating systems that may then impact certain medical devices connected to a communications network, such as wi-fi and public or home Internet, as well as other connected equipment such as routers, connected phones and other critical infrastructure equipment. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities may allow a remote user to take control of a medical device and change its function, cause denial of service, or cause information leaks or logical flaws, which may prevent a device from functioning properly or at all. To date, the FDA has not received any adverse event reports associated with these vulnerabilities. The public was first informed of these vulnerabilities in a July 2019 sent by the Department of Homeland Security. Today, the FDA is providing additional information regarding the source of these vulnerabilities and recommendations for reducing or avoiding risks the vulnerabilities may pose to certain medical devices. “While advanced devices can offer safer, more convenient and timely health care delivery, a medical device connected to a communications network could have cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could be exploited resulting in patient harm,” said Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D., FDA’s principal deputy commissioner. “The FDA urges manufacturers everywhere to remain vigilant about their medical products—to monitor and assess cybersecurity vulnerability risks, and to be proactive about disclosing vulnerabilities and mitigations to address them. This is a cornerstone of the FDA’s efforts to work with manufacturers, health care delivery organizations, security researchers, other government agencies and patients to develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues that affect medical devices in order to keep patients safe.” The URGENT/11 vulnerabilities exist in a third-party software, called IPnet, that computers use to communicate with each other over a network. This software is part of several operating systems and may be incorporated into other software applications, equipment and systems. The software may be used in a wide range of medical and industrial devices. Though the IPnet software may no longer be supported by the original software vendor, some manufacturers have a license that allows them to continue to use it without support. Therefore, the software may be incorporated into a variety of medical and industrial devices that are still in use today. Security researchers, manufacturers and the FDA are aware that the following operating systems are affected, but the vulnerability may not be included in all versions of these operating systems: The agency is asking manufacturers to work with health care providers to determine which medical devices, either in their health care facility or used by their patients, could be affected by URGENT/11 and develop risk mitigation plans. Patients should talk to their health care providers to determine if their medical device could be affected and to seek help right away if they notice the functionality of their device has changed. The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices very seriously and today’s safety communication includes recommendations to manufacturers for continued monitoring, reporting and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA is recommending that manufacturers conduct a risk assessment, as described in the FDA’s , to evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities on medical devices they manufacture and develop risk mitigation plans. Medical device manufacturers should work with operating system vendors to identify available patches and other recommended mitigation methods, work with health care providers to determine any medical devices that could potentially be affected, and discuss ways to reduce associated risks. Some medical device manufacturers are already actively assessing which devices may be affected by URGENT/11 and are identifying risk and remediation actions. In addition, several manufacturers have already of affected products, which include medical devices such as an imaging system, an infusion pump and an anesthesia machine. The FDA expects that additional medical devices with one or more of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities will be identified. “While we are not aware of patients who may have been harmed by this particular cybersecurity vulnerability, the risk of patient harm if such a vulnerability were left unaddressed could be significant,” said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The safety communication issued today contains recommendations for what actions patients, health care providers and manufacturers should take to reduce the risk this vulnerability could pose. It’s important for manufacturers to be aware that the nature of these vulnerabilities allows the attack to occur undetected and without user interaction. Because an attack may be interpreted by the device as a normal network communication, it may remain invisible to security measures.” The FDA will continue its work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to help develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device's total product lifecycle. The FDA will continue to assess new information concerning the URGENT/11 vulnerabilities and will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

{"title": "FDA approves second drug to prevent HIV infection as part of ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic", "date": "October 03, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Descovy (emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg) in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection from sex, excluding those who have receptive vaginal sex. Descovy is not indicated in individuals at risk of HIV-1 infection from receptive vaginal sex because the effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated. “PrEP drugs are highly effective when taken as indicated in the drug labeling and can prevent HIV infection,” said Jeffrey Murray, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This approval provides more prevention options for certain patients at-risk for acquiring HIV and helps further efforts by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to facilitate the development of HIV treatment and prevention options to reduce new HIV infections.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 38,739 people received an HIV diagnosis in the U.S. in 2017. To confront this epidemic, President Trump announced an initiative, , in his State of the Union address on February 5, 2019. This opportunity to eliminate new HIV infections in our nation seeks to provide our hardest-hit communities with additional expertise, technology and resources required to address the HIV epidemic. The aim is to reduce new infections by 75% in the next five years and by 90% in the next ten years, averting more than 250,000 HIV infections in that span. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is an HIV prevention method in which people who do not have HIV take medicine on a daily basis to reduce their risk of getting HIV if they are exposed to the virus. Descovy for PrEP should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy, including adherence to daily administration and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually acquired infections. The safety and efficacy of Descovy for PrEP were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind multinational trial in 5,387 HIV-negative men and transgender women who have sex with men and were at risk of HIV-1 infection. The trial compared once daily Descovy to Truvada (emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 200 mg/300 mg), a daily fixed dose combination of two drugs approved in 2012 to prevent the sexual acquisition of HIV; participants were followed for 48 to 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of HIV-1 infection in each group. The trial showed that Descovy was similar to Truvada in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. The most common adverse reaction in individuals without HIV who were taking Descovy for PrEP was diarrhea. There is a boxed warning for individuals who take Descovy who also have hepatitis B virus (HBV) to be aware of the risk of exacerbations of HBV in those who discontinue products with emtricitabine or tenofovir disproxil fumarate, and which may occur in individuals who discontinue Descovy. Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP is contraindicated in individuals with unknown or positive HIV-1 status and should only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every three months during use. Descovy was FDA approved in combination with other antiretoviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients. The FDA granted the approval of Descovy to Gilead Sciences Inc.

{"title": "FDA approves treatment for adults and children with all genotypes of hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis that shortens duration of treatment to eight weeks", "date": "September 26, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today expanded the approval of Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir) tablets for an eight-week duration for the treatment of adults and children ages 12 years and older or weighing at least 99 pounds who have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection and compensated cirrhosis and have not been previously treated for HCV (treatment-naïve). Mavyret is now the first eight-week treatment approved for all treatment-naïve adult and certain pediatric patients with HCV genotypes 1-6 both without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis. Standard treatment length for patients with compensated cirrhosis was previously 12 weeks or more. “This approval provides a treatment duration of eight weeks for both pediatric and adult patients with compensated cirrhois regardless of HCV genotype; meaning that an eight-week treatment regimen is available for any treatment-naïve HCV patient, regardless of cirrhosis status or genotype,” said Jeffrey Murray, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Mavyret is a combination of direct-acting antiviral drugs that reduce the amount of HCV in the body to undetectable levels by preventing the virus from multiplying, and in most cases, curing HCV infection.” HCV is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people in the U.S. have chronic HCV, and children born to HCV-positive mothers are at risk for HCV infection. Researchers estimate there in the U.S. with HCV infection. The efficacy and safety of Mavyret was established in clinical trials, which cumulatively evaluated more than 2,500 people with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection who received Mavyret for eight, 12 or 16 weeks duration.The trials included patients with HIV-co-infection, kidney or liver transplant recipients and patients with advanced kidney disease, including those requiring hemodialysis. The efficacy of HCV treatment regimens are measured by the proportion of people in clinical trials achieving virologic cure. Virologic cure is the lack of detectable HCV in the blood at certain time points after completion of HCV therapy, known as sustained virologic response (SVR). SVR at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR 12) is the standard measure of virologic cure. SVR 12 rates for Mavyret have ranged from 91-100 percent across clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions in patients taking Mavyret are headache and fatigue. Mavyret is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or in those with any history of liver decompensation. It is also contraindicated in patients taking the drugs atazanavir and rifampin. The FDA granted the approval of Mavyret to AbbVie Inc.

{"title": "Statement on consumer warning to stop using THC vaping products amid ongoing investigation into lung illnesses", "date": "October 04, 2019", "contents": " Over the past several weeks, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been working tirelessly along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal, state and local partners to investigate the distressing incidents of severe lung injuries and deaths associated with the use of vaping products. The latest number of , released by the CDC yesterday, continues to underscore the need for us to gather critical information and provide consumers with actionable information to help best protect themselves and their loved ones. This is why today, we’re strengthening our message to the public in an updated stating that they should not use vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. Additionally, consumers who choose to use any vaping products should not modify or add any substances such as THC or other oils to products purchased in stores and should not purchase any vaping products, including those containing THC, off the street or from other illicit channels. This is a complex, ongoing and evolving investigation. In addition to our own analyses, we are also diligently reviewing published literature of third-party analyses of samples and data, which are beneficial to our ongoing investigation. At this time, the FDA does not have enough data to identify the cause, or causes, of the lung injuries in these cases. Additionally, while no one compound or ingredient has emerged as a singular culprit, we do know that THC is present in most of the samples being tested. Because of this, the agency believes it is prudent to stop using vaping products that contain THC or that have had any substances added to them, including those purchased from retail establishments. Simply put, inhaling harmful contaminants in the lungs could put a patient’s health at risk and should be avoided. For those who choose to continue the use of vaping products, particularly those containing THC, we urge you to monitor for symptoms and promptly seek medical attention if you have concerns about your health. We are also continuing to encourage the public to submit detailed reports of any unexpected tobacco- or vaping-related health or product issues to the FDA via the online . And, importantly, no youth or women who are pregnant should be using any vaping product, regardless of the substance. This alert builds on initial recommendations the FDA issued several weeks ago and is based on new information we’re continuing to learn from both patients and the samples that have been tested so far. For example, additional testing revealed that a majority of the hundreds of samples of vaping products tested by the states or by the FDA so far have been identified as containing THC. Additionally, according to , most of the patients impacted by these illnesses reported using THC-containing products, suggesting THC products are playing a role in the these illnesses. That said, some patients have reported using both THC products and nicotine products, as well as a smaller number reporting using only nicotine products. Similarly, testing on the samples collected or received by the FDA shows a variety of products, or product components, with different ingredients or delivery systems making this investigation especially challenging. Federal, state and local agencies will continue to work as quickly as possible to get to the bottom of what’s causing people to become ill by following up with patients and doctors to collect important details about the products or substances involved, where they were purchased and how they were being used. In particular, the FDA’s work to investigate the illnesses includes sample collections in coordination with states, sample analysis, criminal and civil investigations, and coordination with state and federal partners. Although these cases present similarly in patients, it is not clear if they have a common cause, or if they have differing pathogenesis with similar presentation. The investigation has not identified any specific substance or product that is linked to all cases. The FDA is using state-of-the-art methods to assess the presence of a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids along with opioids, cutting agents/diluents and other additives, pesticides, poisons and toxins. To date, the agency has collected or received more than 440 samples from 18 states – and that number continues to grow. The FDA is working quickly and thoroughly in testing the samples, prioritizing those associated directly with patient illnesses. More than half of the vaping liquid products have undergone some form of evaluation, with additional testing on these and other samples continuing daily. We are leaving no stone unturned in following all potential leads regarding any particular product, constituent or compound that may be at issue. In that spirit, the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) began parallel investigative efforts shortly after the emergence of the associated illnesses. Our OCI agents are focused on identifying the products that are making people ill and following the supply chain to the source. We are not pursuing any enforcement actions associated with personal use of any vaping products; our interest is in the suppliers. And as I previously said, if we determine that someone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that caused illness and death for personal profit, we would consider that to be a criminal act. We are prepared to use our authorities to the fullest extent possible, and will work with other federal, state and local authorities to take appropriate action as the facts emerge in order to protect the public health. What we’ve learned so far is that this ongoing investigation is complex and evolving. Every day we’re gathering more information, and every day we seek to use that information to better understand the relationship between any specific products or substances and the reported illnesses. We’re committed to working to answer these and other critical questions as quickly as possible, but we also recognize that it will likely take some time. Importantly, the demographic diversity of the patients, as well as the products or substances they’ve reported using and the samples being tested may mean there are multiple causes of these illnesses—some of which may escape us or may never be fully understood. As this complex investigation continues, we urge consumers to take heed of our warning and stop using THC vaping products, and to not use vaping products of any kind that are purchased off the street or from unknown sources. And we remain steadfast in our commitment to work with our federal, state and local partners to identify the cause or causes of these illnesses. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment to increase pain-free light exposure in patients with a rare disorder", "date": "October 08, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted approval to Scenesse (afamelanotide) to increase pain-free light exposure in adult patients with a history of phototoxic reactions (damage to skin) from erythropoietic protoporphyria. For patients who are suffering from erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare disorder, exposure to light may be extremely painful. Prior to today’s approval, there were no FDA-approved treatments to help erythropoietic protoporphyria patients increase their light exposure,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Office of Drug Evaluation III. “Today’s approval is one example of the FDA’s ongoing commitment to encourage industry innovation of therapies to treat rare diseases, and work with drug developers to make promising new therapies available to patients as safely and efficiently as possible.” Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a rare disorder caused by mutations leading to impaired activity of ferrochelatase, an enzyme involved in heme production. Heme is an important component in hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells. The decrease in ferrochelatase activity leads to an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in the body. Light reaching the skin can react with PPIX causing intense skin pain and skin changes, such as redness and thickening. Scenesse (afamelanotide), a melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) agonist, increases the production of eumelanin in the skin independent of exposure to sunlight or artificial light sources.  It is an implant that is administered subcutaneously (inserted under the skin). The efficacy of Scenesse was established in two parallel group clinical trials with patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria who received Scenesse or placebo form of the implant subcutaneously every two months. The first clinical trial enrolled 93 subjects, of whom 48 received Scenesse, and were followed for 180 days. The primary endpoint was the total number of hours over 180 days spent in direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on days with no pain. The median total number of hours over 180 days spent in direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on days with no pain was 64 hours for patients receiving Scenesse and 41 hours for patients taking placebo. The second clinical trial enrolled 74 patients, of whom 38 received Scenesse, and were followed for 270 days. The primary endpoint was the total number of hours over 270 days spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm on days with no pain for which “most of the day” was spent in direct sunlight. The analysis did not include sun exposure on days patients reported spending time in a combination of both direct sunlight and shade. The median total number of hours over 270 days spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm on days with no pain for which “most of the day” was spent in direct sunlight was six hours for patients receiving Scenesse and 0.75 hours for patients receiving placebo. Scenesse’s most common side effects are implant site reaction, nausea, oropharyngeal (part of the throat just behind the mouth, where the oral cavity starts) pain, cough, fatigue, skin hyperpigmentation, dizziness, melanocytic nevus (moles), respiratory tract infection, somnolence (feeling drowsy), non-acute porphyria (build-up of normally occurring molecules created during heme production) and skin irritation. Scenesse should be administered by a health care professional who is proficient in the subcutaneous implantation procedure and has completed the applicant-provided training. Scenesse may induce skin darkening, and a full body skin examination is recommended for patients twice a year. In addition, patients are encouraged to maintain sun protection measures during treatment with Scenesse to prevent phototoxic reactions related to erythropoietic protoporphyria. The FDA granted this application designation. Scenesse also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.The approval of Scenesse was granted to Clinuvel.

The grants were awarded to principal investigators from academia and industry across the country. The FDA awarded the grants through the , funded by Congress to encourage clinical development of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for the treatment of rare diseases. The grants are intended to substantially contribute to marketing approval of products to treat rare diseases or provide essential data needed for development of such products. “For more than 35 years, the FDA has been providing much-needed financial support for clinical trials of potentially life-changing treatments for patients with rare diseases. To date, the Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program’s grants have supported research that led to the marketing approval of more than 60 treatments for rare diseases,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “We are encouraged by the amount of interest we continue to have in the grants program and are committed to working with researchers and industry to facilitate and support the study and development of treatments for patients with rare diseases.” The FDA received 89 clinical trial grant applications that were reviewed and evaluated for scientific and technical merit by more than 100 rare disease experts, including members of academia. The grants awarded are focused on supporting product development to meet the needs of patients impacted by a variety of rare diseases, mainly those affecting children and cancers. The recipients, principal investigators and approximate funding amounts, listed alphabetically, are: “The majority of rare diseases still do not have approved therapies and the FDA is committed to fostering product development in areas of unmet need. The Orphan Products Grants Program is one of several ways that the FDA supports the development of products for rare diseases. Since its creation in 1983, the program has provided more than $400 million to fund more than 600 new clinical studies,” said Janet Maynard, M.D., director of the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development. “We are pleased to continue to support research for a variety of rare diseases that have little, or no, treatment options for patients. By helping to spark research, we hope to speed the development of products for rare diseases, and ultimately, make needed treatments available to those patients who need them most.” Three-quarters (75%) of the new awards fund studies enrolling children, including children as young as one month. These studies target a variety of rare diseases affecting children and have the potential to advance treatments for these diseases. Some of these diseases include Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle loss and weakness; sickle cell disease, a group of inherited red blood disorders which can cause anemia, infections and stroke; and Fanconi Anemia, a rare inherited condition that can result in bone marrow failure and has a high risk for squamous cell cancers. Two-thirds (67%) of the new awards fund clinical studies of products for use in various rare cancers. For example, one of the new awards aims to advance research in brain cancers affecting children. This study enrolls affected children as young as 36 months and tests an innovative treatment approach to treat brain cancers using an engineered virus therapy designed to target and kill tumor cells while sparing normal brain cells. Another newly funded study evaluates a novel drug delivery system that delivers chemotherapy on a sustained basis directly to the eye to treat retinoblastoma, a rare cancer in the eye most commonly affecting young children. This delivery system may help address current barriers to drug delivery that patients face. Past studies funded by this program that have resulted in or contributed to recent product approvals, include: fish oil triglycerides, a first FDA-approved lipid emulsion made from fish oil, approved as a source of calories and fatty acids in children with parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis; and the first treatment (tafamidis meglumine and tafamidis) for heart disease caused by transthyretin mediated amyloidosis.

{"title": "FDA approves new drug for treatment-resistant forms of tuberculosis that affects the lungs", "date": "August 14, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Pretomanid Tablets in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid for the treatment of a specific type of highly treatment-resistant tuberculosis (TB) of the lungs. “The threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections is a key challenge we face as a public health agency,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “The bacterium that causes tuberculosis can develop resistance to the antibiotics used to treat it. Multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB are public health threats due to limited treatment options. New treatments are important to meet patient national and global health needs. That’s why, among our other efforts to address antimicrobial resistance, we’re focused on facilitating the development of safe and effective new treatments to give patients more options to fight life-threatening infections. This approval also marks the second time a drug is being approved under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs, a pathway, advanced by Congress, to spur development of drugs targeting infections that lack effective therapies. We hope we continue to see more development of antibacterial drugs for treating serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patients with unmet medical needs.” Pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid is approved for treating a limited and specific population of adult patients with extensively drug resistant, treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug resistant pulmonary TB. Multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB are difficult to treat due to resistance to available therapies. According to the World Health Organization, in 2016, there were an estimated 490,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB worldwide, with a smaller portion of cases of extensively drug-resistant TB. The safety and effectiveness of Pretomanid, taken orally in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, was primarily demonstrated in a study of 109 patients with extensively drug-resistant, treatment intolerant or non-responsive multidrug-resistant pulmonary TB (of the lungs). Of the 107 patients who were evaluated six months after the end of therapy, 95 (89%) were successes, which significantly exceeded the historical success rates for treatment of extensively drug resistant TB. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid included damage to the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), acne, anemia, nausea, vomiting, headache, increased liver enzymes (transaminases and gamma-glutamyltransferase), indigestion (dyspepsia), rash, increased pancreatic enzymes (hyperamylasemia), visual impairment, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and diarrhea. Pretomanid used in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to bedaquiline or linezolid. Pretomanid is the second drug to be approved under the , or LPAD pathway, established by Congress under the 21st Century Cures Act to advance development and approval of antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in a limited population of patients with unmet need. Approval under the LPAD pathway may be supported by a streamlined clinical development program. These programs may involve smaller, shorter or fewer clinical trials. As required for drugs approved under the LPAD pathway, labeling for Pretomanid includes certain statements to convey that the drug has been shown to be safe and effective only for use in a limited population. Pretomanid also received the FDA’s (QIDP) designation. The QIDP designation is given to antibacterial and antifungal drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. The FDA granted Pretomanid Tablets , under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame, and designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Pretomanid Tablets to The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance). With this approval, The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development is awarded a in accordance with a provision included in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 that aims to encourage development of new drugs and biological products for the prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA proposes new required health warnings with color images for cigarette packages and advertisements to promote greater public understanding of negative health consequences of smoking", "date": "August 15, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in advertisements to promote greater public understanding of the negative health consequences of smoking. The proposed warnings, which feature photo-realistic color images depicting some of the lesser-known, but serious health risks of cigarette smoking, stand to represent the most significant change to cigarette labels in more than 35 years. When finalized, this rule would fulfill a requirement in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and complement additional important work the FDA is undertaking to advance the health of America’s families. “As a cancer doctor and researcher, I am well aware of the staggering toll inflicted on the public health by tobacco products, which cause cancer, heart disease, stroke, emphysema and other medical problems. While most people assume the public knows all they need to understand about the harms of cigarette smoking, there’s a surprising number of lesser-known risks that both youth and adult smokers and nonsmokers may simply not be aware of, such as bladder cancer, diabetes and conditions that can cause blindness,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “With these new proposed cigarette health warnings, we have an enormous public health opportunity to fulfill our statutory mandate and increase the public’s understanding of the full scope of serious negative health consequences of cigarette smoking. Given that tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S., there’s a lot at stake to ensure the public understands these risks. We remain committed to educating the public, especially America’s youth, about the dangers associated with using cigarettes and other tobacco products.” About  34.3 million U.S. adults and nearly 1.4 million U.S. youth (aged 12-17 years) currently smoke cigarettes. Despite years of progress in tackling the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, tobacco use — largely cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure — kills about 480,000 Americans every single year. In fact, smoking kills more people each year than alcohol, HIV, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined, and over 16 million Americans alive today live with disease caused by cigarette smoking. Tobacco use also costs more than $300 billion a year in direct health care costs and lost productivity. Health warnings first appeared on cigarette packages in 1966 and were most recently updated in 1984 to include the Surgeon General’s warnings that appear on packages and in advertisements today. However, research shows that these warnings have become virtually invisible to both smokers and nonsmokers — not attracting much attention and not leaving a very memorable impression of the risks of smoking. As outlined in the proposed rule today, the unchanged content of these health warnings, as well as their small size, location and lack of an image, severely impairs their ability to convey relevant information about the negative health consequences of cigarette smoking in an effective way to the public. Additionally, research shows substantial gaps remain in the public’s knowledge of the harms of smoking, and smokers have misinformation regarding cigarettes and the products’ negative health effects. To address these gaps in public understanding, the FDA undertook a to develop and evaluate the new proposed cigarette health warnings announced today. These warnings focus on serious health risks — such as bladder cancer, diabetes, erectile dysfunction and conditions that can cause blindness — that are lesser-known by the public as being negative health consequences of smoking. For example, current smokers have been found to have almost four times the risk of bladder cancer as never smokers, and it has been estimated that smoking is responsible for 5,000 bladder cancer deaths in the United States each year — yet research shows the public has limited awareness of bladder cancer as a consequence of smoking. Participants in the FDA's final consumer research study reported that the information provided by the 13 proposed cigarette health warnings was both new to them and that they learned something from the proposed warnings when compared to the current Surgeon General's warnings on cigarette packages and in advertisements. Based on the findings, the proposed new warnings, each comprising a text statement and corresponding photo-realistic image in full color, include: New cigarette health warnings, once finalized, would appear prominently on cigarette packages and in advertisements, occupying the top 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. The warnings would be required to appear on packages and in advertisements 15 months after a final rule is issued. “Cigarette packages and advertisements can serve as an important channel for communicating health information to broad audiences that include both smokers and nonsmokers. In fact, daily smokers potentially see warnings on cigarette packages more than 5,100 times per year, and all members of the public, including adolescents, are exposed to cigarette advertisements in print and digital media, as well as in and around stores where cigarettes are sold,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “The FDA undertook a comprehensive, science-based research and development process, and took the necessary time to get these new proposed warnings right by developing distinct and clear messages about the negative health consequences of smoking. We are especially encouraged that the research we conducted on these new proposed warnings demonstrated they would lead to improved understanding among both youth and adults, smokers and nonsmokers.” The Tobacco Control Act requires the agency to include new warning labels specifically on cigarette packages and in advertisements. In June 2011, the agency published a final rule requiring color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking to accompany nine textual warning statements specified in the Tobacco Control Act. However, the final rule was challenged in court by several tobacco companies and was ultimately vacated in August 2012 after the U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held that the rule violated the First Amendment. In March 2013, the federal government announced its decision not to seek further review of the court’s ruling. Since that time, the FDA has been conducting comprehensive research and development activities in support of the new proposed cigarette health warning rule announced today in order to satisfy the requirements of the Tobacco Control Act based on — and within the limits of — both science and the law. Following a lawsuit filed by several public health groups, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order in March directing the agency to publish the proposed rule by August 2019 and issue a final rule in March 2020. The proposed rule will be open for public comments for 60 days through Oct. 15. Among other things, the FDA is seeking comments on the proposed cigarette health warnings and how many warnings should be selected for the final rule. Given the degree of public and stakeholder interest in this area, the FDA is also seeking proposals for alternative text and images, as well as scientific information to support a finding that the alternative text and images would advance the government interest in promoting greater public understanding of the negative health consequences of smoking. In addition to the newly proposed cigarette health warnings, the FDA also continues to move forward on a number of separate measures to protect kids and significantly reduce tobacco-related disease and death as part of the agency’s comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first of its kind device to treat pediatric patients with progressive idiopathic scoliosis ", "date": "August 16, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first spinal tether device intended to be used in children and adolescents to correct the most common form of scoliosis, called idiopathic scoliosis, that has not responded to conservative treatment options, such as external bracing. The device, called The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System, is intended to treat growing children and adolescents whose spinal curves are approaching or have reached the range where surgical treatment is an option. “For children and adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis that does not respond favorably to bracing, treatment options have been limited to fusion surgeries,” said Capt. Raquel Peat, Ph.D., director of the Office of Orthopedic Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s approval provides access to a new treatment option that could improve quality of life for patients with idiopathic scoliosis.” Idiopathic scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine whose cause is unknown. It is the most common spinal deformity in children and is most often diagnosed between ages 10 to 18, although it may occur at a younger age. The standard treatments for idiopathic scoliosis among children and adolescents who are still growing are conservative, non-surgical treatments such as external bracing to help correct the spinal curvature. Approximately 6,800 patients in the U.S. each year will develop progressive curvatures that do not respond to bracing. For these patients, spinal fusion surgery (i.e., spinal implants to correct the curvature of the spine and fusion surgery) may be used to permanently stabilize and correct spinal curvatures. While spinal fusion is often successful, this surgery permanently restricts the motion of the spine and may have long-term complications such as pain, arthritis and future spinal deformities, which could require additional surgical treatment. The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System provides an alternative for patients with idiopathic scoliosis that doesn’t respond to bracing. As a patient grows, The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System is designed to continue to correct the curvature while maintaining a fuller range of motion when compared to spinal fusion procedures. The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System includes anchors and vertebral body screws that are placed into the same side of each vertebra in the curved section of the spine through an incision on the side of the chest. A flexible cord, called a tether, is connected to the screws. Tension is applied to the tether during surgery to compress one side of the spine and to partially correct the curve. Over time, the tether slows growth on the curved side of the spine and promotes growth on the opposite side. This provides additional correction of the curve as the patient continues to grow. The Tether - Vertebral Body Tethering System is not intended to be removed unless certain problems, such as overcorrections, develop. Health care professionals will monitor patients, conducting follow-up x-rays, to track the spinal curvature and identify any potential problems that might require additional surgery to revise or remove the device. For those patients whose curves are not adequately corrected by The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System, spinal fusion surgery is still possible. The FDA reviewed data for The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System through the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) process. A (HUD) is a device intended to benefit to patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The FDA reviewed clinical data supporting the safety and probable benefit of The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System from 57 patients who received the device. At two years, 43 patients had sufficient improvement of the curvature of their spines and did not need spinal fusion. The most common serious adverse events observed included overcorrection of the curvature, tether breakage, and pneumothorax or air leakage into the space between the lung and chest wall. General complications consistent with any spinal surgical procedure were also noted including pain, respiratory problems, nerve injuries and bleeding. Zimmer Biomet Spine has shared with the FDA that it will be partnering with the Harms Study Group, a cohort of surgeons dedicated to the advancement of treatment for children and adolescents with spinal deformities, to develop a patient data registry to help assess the long-term performance of The Tether System. “The FDA continues to collaborate with stakeholders to encourage the development of registries, including the one being developed for this device, as an additional tool to gather and track real world evidence,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “This type of post-market data generation can provide ongoing device safety surveillance and additional evidence for effectiveness. More broadly, real world evidence can help support innovative developments while ensuring that patient health and safety remains the top priority.” The FDA granted the approval of The Tether - Vertebral Body Tethering System to Zimmer Biomet Spine.

{"title": "FDA approves third oncology drug that targets a key genetic driver of cancer, rather than a specific type of tumor", "date": "August 15, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted accelerated approval to Rozlytrek (entrectinib), a treatment for adult and adolescent patients whose cancers have the specific genetic defect, NTRK (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase) gene fusion and for whom there are no effective treatments. “We are in an exciting era of innovation in cancer treatment as we continue to see development in tissue agnostic therapies, which have the potential to transform cancer treatment. We’re seeing continued advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Using the FDA’s expedited review pathways, including breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval process, we’re supporting this innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients. We remain committed to encouraging the advancement of more targeted innovations in oncology treatment and across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases.” This is the third time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated. The approval marks a new paradigm in the development of cancer drugs that are “tissue agnostic.” It follows the policies that the FDA developed in a released in 2018. The previous tissue agnostic indications approved by the FDA were for tumors with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors in 2017 and for NTRK gene fusion tumors in 2018. “Today’s approval includes an indication for pediatric patients, 12 years of age and older, who have NTRK-fusion-positive tumors by relying on efficacy information obtained primarily in adults. The FDA continues to encourage the inclusion of adolescents in clinical trials. Traditionally, clinical development of new cancer drugs in pediatric populations is not started until development is well underway in adults, and often not until after approval of an adult indication,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Efficacy in adolescents was derived from adult data and safety was demonstrated in 30 pediatric patients.” The ability of Rozlytrek to shrink tumors was evaluated in four clinical trials studying 54 adults with NTRK fusion-positive tumors. The proportion of patients with substantial tumor shrinkage (overall response rate) was 57%, with 7.4% of patients having complete disappearance of the tumor. Among the 31 patients with tumor shrinkage, 61% had tumor shrinkage persist for nine months or longer. The most common cancer locations were the lung, salivary gland, breast, thyroid and colon/rectum. Rozlytrek was also approved today for the treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors are ROS1-positive (mutation of the ROS1 gene) and has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Clinical studies evaluated 51 adults with ROS1-positive lung cancer. The overall response rate was 78%, with 5.9% of patients having complete disappearance of their cancer. Among the 40 patients with tumor shrinkage, 55% had tumor shrinkage persist for 12 months or longer. Rozlytrek’s common side effects are fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), edema (swelling), dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, dysesthesia (distorted sense of touch), dyspnea (shortness of breath), myalgia (painful or aching muscles), cognitive impairment (confusion, problems with memory or attention, difficulty speaking, or hallucinations), weight gain, cough, vomiting, fever, arthralgia and vision disorders (blurred vision, sensitivity to light, double vision, worsening of vision, cataracts, or floaters). The most serious side effects of Rozlytrek are congestive heart failure (weakening or damage to the heart muscle), central nervous system effects (cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression including suicidal thinking, dizziness or loss of balance, and change in sleep pattern, including insomnia and excessive sleepiness), skeletal fractures, hepatotoxicity (damage to the liver), hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid), QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) and vision disorders. Health care professionals should inform females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Rozlytrek. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Rozlytrek because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Rozlytrek was granted .

{"title": "FDA approves treatment for patients with rare bone marrow disorder", "date": "August 16, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Inrebic (fedratinib) capsules to treat adult patients with certain types of myelofibrosis. “Prior to today, there was one FDA-approved drug to treat patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder. Our approval today provides another option for patients,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The FDA is committed to encouraging the development of treatments for patients with rare diseases and providing alternative options, as not all patients respond in the same way.” Myelofibrosis is a chronic disorder where scar tissue forms in the bone marrow and the production of the blood cells moves from the bone marrow to the spleen and liver, causing organ enlargement. It can cause extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, pain below the ribs, fever, night sweats, itching and bone pain. When myelofibrosis occurs on its own, it is called primary myelofibrosis. Secondary myelofibrosis occurs when there is excessive red blood cell production (polycythemia vera) or excessive platelet production (essential thrombocythemia) that evolves into myelofibrosis. was approved by the FDA in 2011. The approval of Inrebic for intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis was based on the results of a clinical trial where 289 patients with myelofibrosis were randomized to receive two different doses (400 mg or 500 mg daily by mouth) of fedratinib or placebo. The clinical trial showed that 35 of 96 patients treated with the fedratinib 400 mg daily dose (the dose recommended in the approved label) experienced a significant therapeutic effect (measured by greater than or equal to a 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at the end of cycle 6 (week 24) as measured by an MRI or CT scan with a follow-up scan four weeks later). As a result of treatment with Inrebic, 36 patients experienced greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in myelofibrosis-related symptoms, such as night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, feeling full sooner than normal, pain under ribs on left side, and bone or muscle pain. The prescribing information for Inrebic includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of serious and fatal encephalopathy (brain damage or malfunction), including Wernicke’s, which is a neurologic emergency related to a deficiency in thiamine. Health care professionals are advised to assess thiamine levels in all patients prior to starting Inrebic, during treatment and as clinically indicated. If encephalopathy is suspected, Inrebic should be immediately discontinued. Common side effects for patients taking Inrebic are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and muscle spasms. Health care professionals are cautioned that patients may experience severe anemia (low iron levels) and thrombocytopenia (low level of platelets in the blood). Patients should be monitored for gastrointestinal toxicity and for hepatic toxicity (liver damage). The dose should be reduced or stopped if a patient develops severe diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. Treatment with anti-diarrhea medications may be recommended. Patients may develop high levels of amylase and lipase in their blood and should be managed by dose reduction or stopping the mediation. Inrebic must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. The FDA granted this application designation. Inrebic also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.

{"title": "FDA approves first therapy for rare joint tumor", "date": "August 02, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to Turalio (pexidartinib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not responsive to improvement with surgery. “TGCT can cause debilitating symptoms for patients such as pain, stiffness and limitation of movement. The tumor can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life and cause severe disability,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Surgery is the primary treatment option, but some patients are not eligible for surgery, and tumors can recur, even after the procedure. Today’s approval is the first FDA-approved therapy to treat this rare disease.” TGCT is a rare tumor that affects the synovium (thin layer of tissue that covers the surfaces of the joint spaces) and tendon sheaths (layer of membrane that covers tendons, which are fibrous tissue that connect muscle to bone). The tumor is rarely malignant but causes the synovium and tendon sheaths to thicken and overgrow, causing damage to surrounding tissue. The approval of Turalio was based on the results of a multi-center international clinical trial of 120 patients, 59 of whom received placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) analyzed after 25 weeks of treatment. The clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR in patients who received Turalio, with an ORR of 38%, compared to no responses in patients who received placebo. The complete response rate was 15% and the partial response rate was 23%. A total of 22 out of 23 responders who had been followed for a minimum of six months following the initial response maintained their response for six or more months, and a total of 13 out of 13 responders who had been followed for a minimum of 12 months following the initial response maintained their response for 12 or more months. The prescribing information for Turalio includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the risk of serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Health care professionals should monitor liver tests prior to beginning treatment and at specified intervals during treatment. If liver tests become abnormal, Turalio may need to be withheld, the dose reduced, or permanently discontinued, depending on the severity of the liver injury. Turalio is available only through the Turalio Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Common side effects for patients taking Turalio were increased lactate dehydrogenase (proteins that helps produce energy in the body), increased aspartate aminotransferase (enzymes that are mostly in the liver but also in muscles), loss of hair color, increased alanine aminotransferase (enzymes that are primarily in the liver and kidney) and increased cholesterol. Additional side effects included neutropenia (low level of white blood cells that help the immune system defend against disease and infection), increased alkaline phosphatase (enzymes that are mostly in the cells of bone and the liver), decreased lymphocytes (white blood cells that help the immune system defend against disease and infection), eye edema (swelling around the eyes), decreased hemoglobin (protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen), rash, dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) and decreased phosphate (electrolytes that help with energy). The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Turalio. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Turalio because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Turalio must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. The FDA granted this application designation and designation.

In addition to advising restaurants and food retailers to stop selling Topway’s RTE seafood products, the FDA safety alert specifically advises consumers who have recently purchased RTE seafood products in Texas and Louisiana, particularly salmon and tuna for raw consumption, to contact the restaurant or food retailer for more information about where the seafood was processed and sourced. Topway ships RTE fresh seafood products to restaurants and food retail outlets. Consumers who think they have purchased or consumed Topway products should discard products. a species of disease-causing bacteria. When people eat food contaminated with , they may develop a disease called listeriosis. This infection can have serious adverse effects for consumers, particularly women who are or may become pregnant, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Therefore, the FDA continues to advise that recipients of Topway RTE seafood products, clean and sanitize the surfaces on which these products were served, stored or prepared. The FDA first inspected the Topway facility in February, which resulted in the detection of 31 non-pathogenic on swabs collected throughout the facility and observations of egregious sanitation deficiencies. At the close of the inspection, the investigators issued a FDA Form 483 to document inspectional observations pertaining to insanitary conditions at the facility. The form noted poor employee sanitation and production practices and significant facility deficiencies, such as cracked and uncleanable floors in the high-traffic areas such as the production and fish cooler rooms, pools of black water on the fish cooler floors, uncleaned utensils used to process seafood, fish particles on production room walls, and an accumulation of residues on seafood processing tables. The FDA alerted Topway of the agency’s findings and the company assured the agency it would take corrective actions. On behalf of the FDA, the Texas DSHS conducted a follow-up compliance inspection from June 24 through July 3. State inspectors observed that the company had not corrected the sanitation and seafood safety compliance deficiencies identified by the related FDA inspection. This inspection resulted in 66 non-pathogenic positive samples, egregious sanitation deficiency observations and four environmental swabs that tested positive for On July 3, FDA and Texas officials notified Topway of the recent environmental sampling results for their facility. The company agreed to voluntarily cease operations and recall certain products. To date, the company has not implemented adequate corrective actions to address the risks that were identified. Topway also continued production by operating in a temporary location where it moved some equipment and personnel to process seafood products for sale while performing cleaning at its facility. The FDA is in the process of working with the company to address the violations at both locations. Only after an appropriate corrective plan has been established and implemented at both the facility and temporary processing location will the FDA consider allowing the company to resume operations. The FDA is not aware of any confirmed illnesses related to these seafood products. However, consumers who think they may have been sickened by these products should seek the assistance of a health care professional and contact the FDA to with any FDA-regulated products. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA warns company marketing unapproved cannabidiol products with unsubstantiated claims to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal, pain and pet anxiety", "date": "July 23, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it has issued a to Curaleaf Inc., of Wakefield, Massachusetts, for illegally selling unapproved products containing cannabidiol (CBD) online with unsubstantiated claims that the products treat cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal, pain and pet anxiety, among other conditions or diseases. “As we examine potential regulatory pathways for the lawful marketing of products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds like CBD, protecting and promoting public health remains our top priority. Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims — such as claims that CBD products can treat serious diseases and conditions — can put patients and consumers at risk by leading them to put off important medical care. Additionally, there are many unanswered questions about the science, safety, effectiveness and quality of unapproved products containing CBD,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Today’s action demonstrates that the agency stands firm in its commitment to continue monitoring the marketplace and protecting the public health by taking action as needed against companies that deceive consumers and put them at risk by illegally selling products marketed for therapeutic uses for which they are not approved, such as those claiming to treat cancer or Alzheimer’s disease. Consumers should beware of purchasing or using any such products.” Given the interest in products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, and CBD in particular, the FDA has and continues to take an agency-wide, integrated, and collaborative approach to addressing the regulation of products made from CBD that fall under its jurisdiction. The agency has established a high-level internal working group to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. An important component of this work is obtaining and evaluating information to address outstanding questions related to the safety of CBD products that will inform the agency’s consideration of potential regulatory frameworks for CBD while maintaining the FDA’s rigorous public health standards. As part of that work, the FDA held a in May, and opened a docket for written comments, to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. “We will continue to work to protect the health and safety of American consumers from products that are being marketed in violation of the law through actions like those the FDA is taking today. At the same time, we also recognize the potential opportunities and significant interest in drug and other consumer products containing CBD,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “We understand this is an important national issue with public health impact and of interest to American hemp farmers and many other stakeholders. The agency has a well-established pathway for drug development and drug approvals, and we remain committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to other types of CBD products. We plan to report our progress by early this fall as we expedite our work to address the many questions about CBD. The step-wise, science-based approach we’re taking protects patients and the public health, fosters innovation for safe and appropriate products, and promotes consumer confidence.” As described in the warning letter issued to Curaleaf, the company used product webpages, its online store and social media websites to make unfounded claims about more than a dozen different CBD products. Examples of the unsupported and unapproved claims made by the company include: The FDA has requested responses from Curaleaf within 15 working days stating how the violations will be corrected. Failure to correct the violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and injunction. The agency continues to be concerned at the proliferation of products asserting to contain CBD that are marketed for therapeutic or medical uses that have not been approved by the FDA. The FDA approval process ensures that drugs on the market are safe and effective for their intended therapeutic uses. CBD is marketed in a variety of product types, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas and topical lotions and creams. Often such products are sold online and are therefore available throughout the country. Other than to treat rare, severe forms of epilepsy, the FDA has not approved any other CBD products, and there is very limited information for other marketed CBD products, which likely differ in composition from the FDA-approved product and have not been evaluated for potential adverse effects on the body. Unlike drugs approved by the FDA, the manufacturing process of these products has not been subject to FDA review as part of the drug approval process, and there has been no FDA evaluation of whether these products are effective for their intended use, what the proper dosage is, how they could interact with FDA-approved drugs, or whether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns. Unsubstantiated claims associated with CBD products may lead consumers to put off getting important medical care, such as proper diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. For that reason, it’s important that consumers talk to a health care professional about the best way to treat diseases or conditions with existing, approved treatment options. The FDA also cautions pet owners against the use of such products and recommends talking with a veterinarian about appropriate treatment options for pets. The agency also has not approved cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds like CBD for any use in animals and cannot ensure the safety or effectiveness of these products. The FDA has previously sent to other companies illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer. Some of these products were in further violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they were marketed as dietary supplements or because they involved the addition of CBD to food. The agency encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse reactions associated with these or similar products to the agency’s The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA takes action to protect patients from risk of certain textured breast implants; requests Allergan voluntarily recall certain breast implants and tissue expanders from market", "date": "July 24, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today took significant action to protect women from breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) by requesting that Allergan, the manufacturer of a specific type of textured implant, recall specific models of its textured breast implants from the U.S. market due to the risk of BIA-ALCL. Following the agency’s request, Allergan has notified the FDA that it is moving forward with a worldwide recall of their BIOCELL textured breast implant products, including: Natrelle Saline-Filled breast implants, Natrelle Silicone-Filled breast implants, Natrelle Inspira Silicone-Filled breast implants, and Natrelle 410 Highly Cohesive Anatomically Shaped Silicone-Filled breast implants. The recall also includes tissue expanders used by patients prior to breast augmentation or reconstruction, including Natrelle 133 Plus Tissue Expander and Natrelle 133 Tissue Expander with Suture Tabs. The recall helps ensure that unused products are removed from suppliers and doctors’ offices. The agency also issued a today for patients with breast implants, patients considering breast implants and their health care professionals outlining the known risks and what steps patients should consider when monitoring for symptoms of BIA-ALCL, including swelling and pain in their breasts. The safety communication also lists information about all models and style numbers included in the recall. “Although the overall incidence of BIA-ALCL appears to be relatively low, once the evidence indicated that a specific manufacturer’s product appeared to be directly linked to significant patient harm, including death, the FDA took action to alert the firm to new evidence indicating a recall is warranted to protect women’s health,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “The FDA has been diligently monitoring this issue since we first identified the possible association between breast implants and ALCL in 2011 and, at that time, communicated to patients and providers that there is a risk for women with breast implants, more frequently occurring in women with textured implants, for developing this disease. Since that time, we have worked to increase awareness and encourage reporting of all cases to the FDA so that we could continue to monitor this potential safety signal. As this issue and the science have continued to develop, we have been monitoring the reports in databases, including external patient registries, and in scientific literature. Based on new data, our team concluded that action is necessary at this time to protect the public health. We will continue to monitor the incidence of BIA-ALCL across other textured and smooth breast implants and tissue expanders as well as other devices intended for use in the breast. If action is needed in the future, we will not hesitate to do what is necessary to protect patients.” In a table updated today on the agency’s BIA-ALCL , the FDA provides the new total of 573 unique cases globally of BIA-ALCL and 33 patient deaths, which reflect a significant increase in known cases of BIA-ALCL since the agency’s —an increase of 116 new unique cases and 24 deaths. Specifically, of the 573 unique cases of BIA-ALCL, 481 are attributed to Allergan implants. Of the 33 patient deaths the FDA is reporting today, 12 of the 13 patients for which the manufacturer of the implant is known, are confirmed to have an Allergan breast implant at the time of their BIA-ALCL diagnosis. These cases include new data reported to the agency since the public advisory committee meeting in March. Based on the currently available information, including the newly submitted data, our analysis demonstrates that the risk of BIA-ALCL with Allergan BIOCELL textured implants is approximately six times the risk of BIA-ALCL with textured implants from other manufacturers marketing in the U.S. The table on the FDA’s website summarizes the cases, along with a breakdown of important information such as breast implant surface texture, patient’s age at diagnosis, time from last implant to diagnosis, and other details to give patients and health care professionals the most complete information possible about the known factors impacting these unique cases and deaths. The FDA is continuing to evaluate these additional case reports and will make this information available on its database of adverse event reports within the next few weeks. The FDA has taken multiple steps to better understand the safety and risks of breast implants and to help strengthen the evidence generated to help inform its regulatory actions in this area, including sharing updates with the public (as recently as 2019 and via a ) and encouraging patients and health care professionals to report adverse events to the agency. This voluntary recall is a direct result of the agency’s comprehensive efforts to improve the quality of data collected and analyzed, and the FDA’s ongoing work to evaluate all available safety information. “We understand that today’s news may be alarming to some patients with breast implants. In the safety communication issued today, we’re providing actionable information for individuals with specific breast implants and their health care professionals. The FDA does not recommend removal for patients without symptoms due to potential risks, but we provide helpful information for patients and providers to consider when discussing next steps,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Moving forward, we are committed to continuing to share updates with patients about this issue. We will continually evaluate any new information and may, as a result, take action regarding other breast implants, if warranted. In addition, we are continuing our assessment to determine whether the risk of developing BIA-ALCL is limited to specific models of textured, or all textured breast implants. We continue to advise women and health care professionals that the use of breast implants is associated with a risk of developing BIA-ALCL and that the risk is greater with textured implants.” Textured breast implants overall are less common in the U.S. compared to other countries and specifically, macro-textured implants (the type of textured implant that Allergan manufactures) represent less than 5% of all breast implants sold in the U.S. Although this type of textured breast implant may represent a small proportion of the U.S. market, the continued availability of Allergan BIOCELL textured breast implants pose a public health risk to patients. Today’s action by the FDA is similar to other actions initiated by France, Canada and Australia, where the use of textured implants is much higher, sometimes as high as 80% of their market share. These countries have also initiated or taken actions to prompt the recall or removal of certain textured breast implants (including certain breast implants sold by Allergan) from the market. In addition to the voluntary recall announced today, the FDA is initiating other actions to ensure that all women who consider breast implants have the information they need to have thoughtful and balanced discussions with their health care professional on the benefits and risks of breast implants based on clear information reflecting the most current understanding of their safety. For example, as previously discussed, the agency is considering recommendations for changes to the labeling of breast implants, which could include a boxed warning and a patient decision checklist to help women consider the benefits and risks of breast implants. The FDA will continue to focus on gathering available evidence to help inform future regulatory actions and assure that women and health care professionals are informed of the risk of BIA-ALCL as they consider breast implants. To this end, the agency has requested that all breast implant manufacturers provide quarterly trending analyses of adverse events, including BIA-ALCL, and require reporting individual events in the adverse event database for devices and in existing registries. The FDA will continue to analyze all available information regarding risks associated with breast implants, routinely update the BIA-ALCL analysis published on our website and take additional actions when and where necessary. The FDA is committed to protecting the health of women and providing as much information as possible to ensure they and their health care professionals know the benefits and risks of these devices, and that women have the most complete information available to make these important decisions about their health care."},
{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for severe hypoglycemia that can be administered without an injection", "date": "July 24, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Baqsimi nasal powder, the first glucagon therapy approved for the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia that can be administered without an injection. Severe hypoglycemia occurs when a patient’s blood sugar levels fall to a level where he or she becomes confused or unconscious or suffers from other symptoms that require assistance from another person to treat. Typically, severe hypoglycemia occurs in people with diabetes who are using insulin treatment. Baqsimi is approved to treat severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes ages four and older. “People who are living with diabetes are at risk of their blood sugar levels falling below the normal range. There are many products on the market for those who need insulin, but until now, people suffering from a severe hypoglycemic episode had to be treated with a glucagon injection that first had to be mixed in a several-step process,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This new way to administer glucagon may simplify the process, which can be critical during an episode, especially since the patient may have lost consciousness or may be having a seizure. In those situations, we want the process to treat the suffering person to be as simple as possible.” Baqsimi, which is a powder administered into the nose, will come in a single-use dispenser that can be given to someone suffering from a severe hypoglycemic episode. Baqsimi increases blood sugar levels in the body by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream. It has the opposite effect of insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels. Injectable glucagon has been approved for use in the U.S. for several decades.The efficacy and safety of Baqsimi nasal powder glucagon to treat severe hypoglycemia was evaluated in two studies of 83 and 70 adults with diabetes, comparing a single dose of Baqsimi to a single dose of glucagon injection in causing a blood sugar response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Baqsimi adequately increased blood sugar levels. In a pediatric study of 48 patients over the age of four with type 1 diabetes, similar results were observed. Baqsimi should not be taken by patients with pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of adrenal gland tissue, or by patients who have insulinoma, a tumor of the pancreas. Baqsimi should not be taken by patients with a known hypersensitivity to glucagon or the inactive ingredients found in Baqsimi, as allergic reactions may occur. Baqsimi also carries a warning that it should be used with caution by those who have been fasting for long periods, have adrenal insufficiency or have chronic hypoglycemia because these conditions result in low levels of releasable glucose in the liver. The most common adverse reactions associated with Baqsimi are nausea, vomiting, headache, upper respiratory tract irritation, watery eyes, redness of eyes and itchiness. Side effects of Baqsimi are similar to injectable glucagon, with the addition of nasal and eye-related symptoms, such as watery eyes and nasal congestion, because of the way the drug is administered. The FDA granted the approval of Baqsimi to Eli Lilly and Company.

{"title": "FDA clears new indications for existing Lyme disease tests that may help streamline diagnoses", "date": "July 29, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing four previously cleared tests with new indications to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease. The tests cleared today are the first time that a test has been indicated to follow a new testing paradigm in which two tests called enzyme immunoassays (EIA) are run concurrently or sequentially, rather than the current two-step process in which a separate protein test called a Western Blot must be run after the initial EIA test. “Lyme disease can have a devastating impact on patients. With today’s action, clinicians have a new option to test for Lyme that is easier to interpret by a clinical laboratory due to the streamlined method of conducting the test. These tests may improve confidence in diagnosing a patient for a condition that requires the earliest possible treatment to ensure the best outcome for patients,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue and skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system. In 2017, the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published data, a total of 42,743 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC, an increase of 17% from 2016. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease has traditionally used a two-tier process for detecting the presence of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in a patient’s blood. Antibodies are proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection. In the previous two-tier approach, different types of tests were used (EIA and Western blots) to confirm a clinical diagnosis. The tests cleared today involve a modified approach that uses only EIA technology-based tests. The FDA reviewed data from clinical studies of the ZEUS ELISA Borrelia VlsE1/pepC10 IgG/IgM Test System, ZEUS ELISA Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM Test System, ZEUS ELISA Borrelia burgdorferi IgM Test System, and the ZEUS ELISA Borrelia burgdorferi IgG Test System that showed this alternative approach, referred to as a modified two-tier test, is as accurate as current methods for detecting antibodies for assessing exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, over current methods. CDC recommendations should be followed for the diagnosis of Lyme disease and for determining when laboratory tests are appropriate. The enzyme immunoassay tests were reviewed through the (510(k)) pathway. A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device. The FDA granted clearance of the ZEUS ELISA enzyme immunoassay tests to ZEUS Scientific. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on the agency’s actions to tackle the epidemic of youth vaping and court ruling on application submission deadlines for certain tobacco products, including e-cigarettes", "date": "July 15, 2019", "contents": " Late last week, a U.S. District Court judge in Maryland issued a decision that, among other things, requires makers and importers of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and certain other tobacco products like cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah to submit applications for their currently marketed products to the agency within 10 months. This court decision comes at a time when I, like many others, are tremendously concerned about the rising use of e-cigarettes among our nation’s youth and especially the potential for them to become traditional cigarette smokers. We cannot allow the next generation of young people to become addicted to nicotine because of e-cigarettes. I am all too aware of the staggering toll inflicted on the public health by tobacco products. As someone who has dedicated my life to reducing the public health burden and suffering caused by cancer, the importance of preventing youth addiction to nicotine rings especially true to me. The FDA stands ready to accelerate the review of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco products. And we remain committed to tackling the epidemic of youth vaping using all available regulatory tools at our disposal. We will continue to take vigorous enforcement actions aimed at ensuring e-cigarettes and other tobacco products aren’t being marketed to, or sold to, kids. We will continue expanding our highly successful education efforts, such as “The Real Cost” campaign, to educate youth about the dangers of using tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. And we will continue to implement the policies necessary to keep e-cigarettes and all tobacco products out of the hands of America’s kids. Our ongoing oversight of e-cigarettes and other ENDS products is critical to our public health mission and, especially, to protecting kids from the dangers of nicotine and tobacco-related disease and death. The judge’s decision sets a rapid pace for the agency to receive and review applications to evaluate the public health benefits and harms of a product and ensure that any product authorized for marketing is appropriate for the protection of public health. Importantly, the judge recognized the agency’s work to provide a framework and clear guidance for companies seeking to market e-cigarette and ENDS products as they prepare their product applications. Let me be clear with the tobacco industry: responsible manufacturers certainly don’t need to wait 10 months to act. We’ve outlined our recommendations for what the FDA expects to be included in e-cigarette premarket applications and have provided a number of other resources to aid industry in their submissions for other products and assist the agency in fulfilling its public health mandate. We encourage industry to use these resources now as a guide for their submissions to the agency. Additionally, we will continue to take decisive action to address and mitigate the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use through compliance, education and enforcement. Notably, the agency remains committed to finalizing the compliance policy we proposed in March to limit youth access to flavored tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars as quickly as possible. Finalizing the compliance policy is one of the most critical public health steps that the FDA can take to curb youth vaping and address youth use of flavored cigars. Later this month, we’ll also be launching our first e-cigarette prevention TV advertisements educating kids about the dangers of e-cigarette use as part of “ ” Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign. As we approach the campaign’s one-year anniversary, we are also planning to distribute new posters for U.S. high schools for the start of the new school year and are also developing educational materials for middle schools across the country. This public education effort launched in September 2018 with hard-hitting advertising on digital and social media sites, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages displayed in high schools across the nation, targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. In addition to the public education campaign’s work to address this growing use among kids, we’ve taken a number of to combat the illegal sales of e-cigarettes to youth, and other actions to target kid-friendly marketing that increases the appeal of these products to youth. From April 2018 through April 2019, the FDA issued more than 3,950 warning letters and more than 665 civil money penalties (fines) to brick-and-mortar and online retailers for illegal sales of e-cigarettes and other ENDS products, including e-liquids, to minors. The FDA also – many in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission – against for selling e-liquids that resemble kid-friendly foods, such as juice boxes, cereal and candy; and issued to four firms that manufacture, advertise and offer for sale or distribution several flavored e-liquid products for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on each company’s behalf, including failure to include the required nicotine warning statement. The FDA also continues to investigate counterfeit e-cigarette products, as well as whether companies are introducing new e-cigarettes in violation of premarket authorization requirements. We’ve also undertaken efforts to further the discussion and understanding around how we can help those kids who are already addicted to the nicotine in e-cigarettes quit. This includes holding a and a separate to discuss efforts to eliminate youth e-cigarette use as well as other tobacco product use, with a focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation and the issues impacting the development of such therapies for youth. While certain ENDS products may hold some promise in helping addicted adult smokers transition away from combustible tobacco to a potentially less harmful form of nicotine delivery, these products – like all tobacco products – pose risk, and should not be used by kids. Years of progress to combat youth use of tobacco – to prevent lifetimes of addiction to nicotine – is now threatened by an epidemic of e-cigarette use by kids. We must also keep our nation’s youth from using dangerous combusted tobacco products like cigars. As part of our , we will maintain our energy and focus on using our authorities forcefully to prevent kids from getting their hands on tobacco products, with a particular emphasis on the threat of youth vaping.

The determination of efficacy of Recarbrio was supported in part by the findings of the efficacy and safety of imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of cUTI and cIAI. The contribution of relebactam to Recarbrio was assessed based on data from in vitro studies and animal models of infection. The safety of Recarbrio, administered via injection, was studied in two trials, one each for cUTI and cIAI. The cUTI trial included 298 adult patients with 99 treated with the proposed dose of Recarbrio. The cIAI trial included 347 patients with 117 treated with the proposed dose of Recarbrio. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Recarbrio included nausea, diarrhea, headache, fever and increased liver enzymes. Recarbrio should not be used in patients taking ganciclovir unless the benefits outweigh the risks as generalized seizures have been reported. Patients should also avoid using Recarbrio when taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium, drugs used to manage seizures, as a reduction in valproic acid level may lead to seizures. Recarbrio received FDA’s (QIDP) designation. The QIDP designation is given to antibacterial and antifungal drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. As part of QIDP designation, Recarbrio was granted under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame.

Layne, to stop distributing food, drug products, medical devices and cosmetics until the company complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other requirements listed in a consent decree. According to the amended complaint, J and L Grocery held FDA-regulated products under insanitary conditions in which they may have become contaminated with filth, including widespread insect, rodent and other live animal infestation, in violation of federal law. “U.S. consumers rely on the oversight and inspection efforts of the FDA to ensure that their foods and medical products are safe. We will not tolerate insanitary conditions at facilities—like J and L Grocery— that serve U.S. consumers. Product safety at all points in the supply chain must be a high priority, and distributors have a critical responsibility to ensure products are kept safe for Americans to consume or use,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “When adulterated products make their way into the U.S. marketplace, it places consumers at risk. The FDA will continue our vigorous oversight and will take action to prevent the distribution of potentially contaminated products to the American people.” During the FDA’s inspection of J and L Grocery in September-October 2018, investigators observed multiple live and dead rodents, rodent nesting, live racoons, live cats, a dead possum, animal feces and urine-stained products in and around the company’s seven warehouses and sheds used to store food, medical products and cosmetics. The FDA issued two Administrative Detention Orders at J and L Grocery, dated October 9 and 19, 2018. On November 7 and 8, 2018, the U.S. Marshals Service conducted a of the company’s FDA-regulated human and animal food products, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, cosmetic products and medical devices. The consent decree of condemnation and permanent injunction entered by U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes, III requires J and L Grocery to cease distribution of FDA-regulated products until it completes corrective actions. Under the consent decree, J and L Grocery may not resume operations until it establishes and implements a comprehensive written sanitation control program and receives written authorization from the FDA that it appears to be in compliance with the FD&C Act, among other requirements. As part of the consent decree, the company agreed to destroy the seized products. The U.S. Department of Justice filed the complaint on behalf of the FDA. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first chemoimmunotherapy regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "date": "June 10, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), in combination with the chemotherapy bendamustine and a rituximab product (a combination known as “BR”), to treat adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that has progressed or returned after at least two prior therapies. Polivy is a novel antibody-drug conjugate, and DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. “Antibody-drug conjugates are an emerging class of targeted immunotherapies for cancer. This type of therapy, unlike traditional chemotherapy, is intended to target specific cells,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval of Polivy provides an alternative option for patients in whom multiple treatments have not worked.” More than 18,000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year in the U.S. Although it can be cured, about 30 to 40% of patients suffer relapse. This type of cancer grows quickly in the lymph nodes and may affect the bone marrow, spleen, liver or other organs. Signs and symptoms of DLBCL may include swollen lymph nodes, fever, recurring night sweats and weight loss. Polivy is an antibody that is attached to a chemotherapy drug. Polivy binds to a specific protein (called CD79b) found only on B cells (a type of white blood cell), then releases the chemotherapy drug into those cells. Efficacy was evaluated in a study of 80 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who were randomized to receive Polivy with BR or BR alone. Efficacy was based on complete response rate and duration of response (DOR), defined as the time the disease stays in remission. At the end of treatment, the complete response rate was 40% with Polivy plus BR compared to 18% with BR alone. Of the 25 patients who achieved a partial or complete response to Polivy plus BR, 16 (64%) had a DOR of at least six months and 12 (48%) had a DOR of at least 12 months. The most common side effects of Polivy plus BR include low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), platelets (thrombocytopenia) and red blood cells (anemia); nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy); fatigue; diarrhea; fever; decreased appetite; and pneumonia. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients closely for infusion-related reactions, low blood counts and fatal and/or serious infections. Health care professionals should also monitor patients for tumor lysis syndrome (a complication from many tumor cells being killed off at the same time), liver damage (hepatotoxicity) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal or life-threatening infection of the brain. FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Polivy and for three months after the last dose. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Polivy because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Polivy in combination with BR was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on an endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to verify and describe Polivy’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designations. Polivy also received , which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Polivy to Genentech.

{"title": "Statement on FDA’s scientific work to understand per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in food, and findings from recent FDA surveys", "date": "June 11, 2019", "contents": " At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, increasing our scientific knowledge and capabilities is a cornerstone to ensuring the safety of the foods that Americans consume. We do this by reviewing all available scientific evidence to determine the safety of foods and food packaging and conducting our own research to fill in gaps in the science. As part of these efforts, the FDA has been working to develop new methods to quantify certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in foods. We have employed these new methods to test samples of foods Americans typically consume for certain types of PFAS, and today we are making available recently analyzed data from these initial testing initiatives. did not detect PFAS in the vast majority of the foods tested. In addition, based on the best available current science, the FDA does not have any indication that these substances are a human health concern, in other words a food safety risk in human food, at the levels found in this limited sampling. These data give our scientists a benchmark to use as we continue our critical work studying this emerging area of science. are a family of human-made chemicals that are found in a wide range of products used by consumers and industry. There are nearly 5,000 types of PFAS, some of which have been more widely used and studied than others. Many PFAS are impermeable to grease, water and oil. For this reason, beginning in the 1940s, PFAS have been used for many different applications including in stain- and water-resistant fabrics and carpeting, cleaning products, paints and fire-fighting foams, as well as in limited, authorized uses in cookware and food packaging and processing, referred to as food contact substances. The widespread use of PFAS and their ability to remain intact in the environment means that over time PFAS levels from past and current uses can result in increasing levels of contamination of groundwater and soil. This same accumulation also can occur in humans and animals, with PFAS found in the blood of humans and animals worldwide. While the science surrounding the potential health effects of PFAS is developing, current evidence suggests that the bioaccumulation of certain PFAS may cause serious health conditions. However, with the decrease in production and use of certain PFAS, in the U.S. have been declining. PFAS can occur in food through environmental contamination, including contaminated water and soil used to grow the food. This type of contamination can occur in a specific geographic area; for example, a water well or farm near an industrial facility where PFAS were produced, or an oil refinery, airfield, or other location at which PFAS were used for firefighting. PFAS can also come into contact with food as a result of the limited authorized uses as food contact substances. Addressing potential effects of Americans’ PFAS exposure is a national priority and effort and work is underway in this area by several government agencies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are advancing knowledge around environmental exposures and potential health risks from PFAS, and the Agency is working on issues related to PFAS contamination with these and other federal partners, including the Department of Defense. State health partners are also investigating exposure and working to reduce exposure in local communities. The FDA recognizes its important role in generating, applying and evaluating the science that is needed to begin to estimate exposures from food. As we continue this research, we will be better able to detect, evaluate, and respond more quickly to potential contamination issues involving food. The FDA has tested foods for PFAS coming from specific geographic areas with known environmental contamination. Recent limited surveys were conducted on dairy products from certain farms in New Mexico and produce from North Carolina, both of which were from specific areas with known PFAS contamination. For every sample for which PFAS was detected, a safety assessment was performed by FDA scientists. In the case of one dairy farm in New Mexico, milk samples were determined to be a potential health concern and all milk from the farm was discarded and not distributed into the American food supply, and milk production from those cattle has been suspended. The Agency continues to work closely with our regulatory partners in the New Mexico Department of Agriculture on these issues. In the case of the produce samples from North Carolina, the levels of PFAS detected were low and, based on our safety assessment using the best available science, samples were determined not likely to be a health concern at the levels found through testing. To conduct these safety assessments, the FDA reviews relevant information, such as the levels of PFAS found in that food, consumption of that food and the most current toxicological information for PFAS, which we use to determine whether the levels of PFAS found in that food may pose a health concern, especially to vulnerable populations. Over the last year, we have expanded our testing to analyze for PFAS in foods typically eaten by Americans, and not associated with specific contamination areas. The samples analyzed were from foods originally collected as part of the FDA’s Total Diet Study (TDS) in 2017 and analyzed in 2019. This is the first time the FDA has tested for PFAS in such a highly diverse sample of foods. While no PFAS compounds were detected in the majority of the foods sampled, varying levels of PFAS were found in 14 samples out of 91, but our safety assessment determined the products were not likely to be health concern at the levels that were detected. We plan to continue this testing and currently have new TDS samples in the lab for analysis. Combined with our other sampling, the testing will help us calculate the risks of exposure through food. Our findings on dairy, produce, and the samples from the TDS were recently presented by FDA scientists at this year’s annual meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) in Helsinki, Finland. The purpose of this scientific presentation was to share, with the scientific community, the new methodologies being advanced by the FDA for measuring concentrations of these substances across a wide variety of foods, and the early findings generated from the application of these methods. The FDA has published information on PFAS testing in other foods in the past, but FDA scientists also shared information on its recent limited PFAS testing. Since PFAS contamination is not specific to the U.S., sharing the FDA’s knowledge and analytical advances with scientists from across the world working on this issue is an important part of our work to begin to address this problem globally. Overall, the FDA’s testing to date has shown that very few foods contain detectable levels of PFAS. However, we know that levels may not be uniform and there is more work to be done. To ensure we are taking the best approach to this complex issue, we have established an internal agency PFAS workgroup with representatives from the human and animal foods programs. A key objective of this workgroup is to establish base-line levels for PFAS in foods, which requires data from these initial and future surveys, and will be used to then estimate overall PFAS exposure. The workgroup will use a systematic, risk-based approach to identify and prioritize FDA activities to reduce exposure to PFAS in human and animal food, guided by available data. Measuring PFAS concentrations in food, estimating dietary exposure and determining the associated health effects is an emerging area of science. Although the FDA’s scientists are at the forefront of developing new and more sensitive testing methods to measure PFAS in foods, this work does not occur in isolation. We’re also working closely with our federal and state partners to advance the science of PFAS detection and better understand the potential health risks associated with PFAS exposure. As the FDA continues to evaluate the food supply, we are committed to using the advanced analytical capabilities of FDA labs to generate and share new scientific information, such as our testing methodologies. By working closely with our state partners and helping them to develop their own testing capacities, we can work together to increase the baseline knowledge of PFAS occurrence in foods. We will also continue to support response to local requests about known or possible contamination events. Federal and state partners each have important roles to play to better understand PFAS exposures and potential health effects, and the FDA will continue to work with these partners to help inform appropriate next steps to protect and promote public health. As part of an , the FDA is committed to testing more foods, collaborating with other federal agencies, helping states develop their own testing capacities, and continuing to support responses to contamination events. It is critical that we continue to share our knowledge and leverage existing and new resources as local, state and federal agencies work together to study this emerging public health issue. We remain committed to sharing further updates as our ongoing surveillance work into PFAS exposure in foods continues. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes", "date": "June 17, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Victoza (liraglutide) injection for treatment of pediatric patients 10 years or older with type 2 diabetes. Victoza is the first non-insulin drug approved to treat type 2 diabetes in pediatric patients since metformin was approved for pediatric use in 2000. Victoza has been approved to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes since 2010. “The FDA encourages drugs to be made available to the widest number of patients possible when there is evidence of safety and efficacy,” said Lisa Yanoff, M.D, acting director of the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Victoza has now been shown to improve blood sugar control in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes. The expanded indication provides an additional treatment option at a time when an increasing number of children are being diagnosed with this disease.” Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, occurring when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep blood sugar at normal levels. Although type 2 diabetes primarily occurs in patients over the age of 45, the prevalence rate among younger patients has been rising dramatically over the past couple of decades. The Diabetes Report Card published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 5,000 new cases of type 2 diabetes are diagnosed each year among U.S. youth younger than age 20. Victoza improves blood sugar levels by creating the same effects in the body as the glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor protein in the pancreas. GLP-1 is often found in insufficient levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Like GLP-1, Victoza slows digestion, prevents the liver from making too much glucose (a simple sugar), and helps the pancreas produce more insulin when needed. As noted on the label, Victoza is not a substitute for insulin and is not indicated for patients with type 1 diabetes or those with diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition associated with diabetes where the body breaks down fat too quickly because there is inadequate insulin or none at all. Victoza is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease; however, its effect on major adverse cardiovascular events in pediatrics was not studied and it is not indicated for this use in children. The efficacy and safety of Victoza for reducing blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes was studied in several placebo-controlled trials in adults and one placebo-controlled trial with 134 pediatric patients 10 years and older for more than 26 weeks. Approximately 64% of patients in the pediatric study had a reduction in their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 7% while on Victoza, compared to only 37% who achieved these results with the placebo. HbA1c is a blood test that is routinely performed to evaluate how well a patient’s diabetes is controlled, and a lower number indicates better control of the disease. These results occurred regardless of whether the patient also took insulin at the same time. Adult patients who took Victoza with insulin or other drugs that increase the amount of insulin the body makes (e.g., sulfonylurea) may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Meanwhile, pediatric patients 10 years and older taking Victoza had a higher risk of hypoglycemia regardless of whether they took other therapies for diabetes. The prescribing information for Victoza includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. For this reason, patients who have had, or have family members who have ever had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) should not use Victoza, nor should patients who have an endocrine system condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). In addition, people who have a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to Victoza or any of the product components should not use Victoza. Victoza also carries warnings about pancreatitis, Victoza pen sharing, hypoglycemia when used in conjunction with certain other drugs known to cause hypoglycemia including insulin and sulfonylurea, renal impairment or kidney failure, hypersensitivity and acute gallbladder disease. The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, indigestion and constipation. The FDA granted this application . The approval of Victoza was granted to Novo Nordisk.

{"title": "FDA launches its first youth e-cigarette prevention TV ads, plans new educational resources as agency approaches one-year anniversary of public education campaign", "date": "July 22, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing the launch of its first e-cigarette prevention TV ads educating kids about the dangers of e-cigarette use. The FDA also plans to provide new posters for high schools and educational materials for middle schools across the U.S. as part of . The public education effort was first launched in September 2018 with hard-hitting advertising on digital and social media sites, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages displayed in high schools across the nation, targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. As the campaign’s one-year anniversary approaches, the new TV ads and school resources are designed to continue to engage youth with important public health messages about the risks of e-cigarette use. “The troubling epidemic of youth vaping threatens to erase the years of progress we’ve made combatting tobacco use among kids, and it’s imperative that our work to tackle this immensely concerning trend continue to include efforts to educate our nation’s youth about the dangers of these products. The new ads as part of our youth prevention campaign highlight one of the many alarming aspects of youth e-cigarette use ‒ that, according to emerging science, teens who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes, putting them at risk of a lifetime of addiction to smoking and related disease. As our new ads state: ‘it’s not magic, it’s statistics,’ and the potential for kids to become traditional cigarette smokers because of e-cigarettes gives me great pause,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We cannot allow the next generation of young people to become addicted to nicotine. We will continue to work to keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of America’s kids through policies to limit youth access to, and appeal of, e-cigarette products, take vigorous compliance and enforcement actions to hold manufacturers and retailers accountable when they illegally market or sell these products to minors, and continue to spearhead highly successful public education efforts to warn youth about the dangers of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.” called “Magic” feature Julius Dein, a popular street magician, who has appeared in online videos with a number of celebrities. In the ads, the social media personality magically turns a teen’s e-cigarette or vape into a cigarette in front of their eyes. This powerful illusion illustrates that teens who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes. These risks are highlighted in research published in , which showed that, compared with non-users, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try conventional cigarettes in the future. This was also a conclusion reached in a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report in 2018 on the . These new ads will run on television networks such as TeenNick, CW, ESPN and MTV, as well as on music streaming sites, social media networks and other teen-focused media channels. Research on the increased likelihood of initiating smoking among youth e-cigarette users is particularly concerning given that over the past several years, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product by youth in the U.S. In fact, more than 3.6 million middle and high school students across the country were current (within the past 30 days) e-cigarette users in 2018, according to the conducted by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a dramatic increase of 1.5 million students from the previous year. The data also showed that youth who used e-cigarettes also were using them more frequently, and more of them were using flavored e-cigarette products, than in 2017. “The Real Cost” Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign educates youth that using e-cigarettes, just like cigarettes, puts them at risk for addiction and other health consequences. The campaign’s other messages highlight that nicotine can rewire the brain to crave more nicotine, particularly because adolescent brains are still developing. Additional messages highlight that e-cigarettes can, among other things, contain dangerous chemicals such as: acrolein, a chemical that can cause irreversible lung damage; formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical; and toxic metal particles, like chromium, lead and nickel. Since its launch, “The Real Cost” E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign is showing positive results for reach and engagement. The campaign, which originally focused on digital and social media sites popular among teens, has generated nearly 2 billion teen views in 9.5 months. Across social media platforms, the FDA has engaged teen audiences with more than 578,000 likes, 89,000 shares, and 31,000 comments. Additionally, since the agency’s work began driving teens who want to quit vaping to , total interactions from all users with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Information Service telephone and online chat services have increased by more than 250%. Next month, the FDA also plans to distribute new posters with e-cigarette prevention messages that will be displayed in high school bathrooms, a place we know many teens are using e-cigarettes or faced with the peer pressure to do so. The agency joined forces with Scholastic, the global children’s publishing, education and media company, to distribute the posters to all public and private high schools in the U.S. The new posters supplement those distributed to high schools nationwide over the last year and deliver new messages catered to teens such as: In addition to the currently available , the FDA, in conjunction with Scholastic, is also planning to develop and distribute new lesson plans and resources for middle school teachers, students and parents that are expected to be made available throughout the 2019-2020 school year. In response to a high demand for information about the potential health consequences of youth e-cigarette use, the agency also developed posters and resources specifically for public health stakeholders such as doctors, youth groups, churches, state and local public health agencies, and others, which are available through the In addition to the public education campaign’s work to address this growing use among kids, the FDA has taken a number of actions as part of its to combat the illegal sales of e-cigarettes to youth, and other actions to target kid-friendly marketing that increases the appeal of these products to youth. The agency has also undertaken efforts to further the discussion and understanding around how to help aid those kids who are already addicted to e-cigarettes quit. “The Real Cost” Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign is a nearly $60 million effort. The campaign is part of the FDA's ongoing efforts to prevent disease and death caused by tobacco use and will complement the agency's other youth tobacco prevention campaigns. The youth e-cigarette prevention campaign serves as an extension of initial e-cigarette prevention content in October 2017 and follows the same framework set forth by “The Real Cost” Cigarette Prevention Campaign, which has and has saved kids, their families and the country by reducing smoking-related costs like early loss of life, costly medical care, lost wages, lower productivity and increased disability.

{"title": "Federal officials seize adulterated dietary supplements from Life Rising Corporation due to poor manufacturing practices", "date": "June 14, 2019", "contents": " At the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Marshals seized more than 300,000 containers of dietary supplements, including tablets, capsules, and teas from Life Rising Corporation. The seized goods, which were held by Life Rising or manufactured in the company’s facility located in Willowbrook, Ill., consisted of more than 500 products bearing brand names Life Rising, Holicare, or HopeStream, and are valued at approximately $3.5 million. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois determined there was probable cause that the company prepared, packed, and/or held dietary supplements under conditions that do not conform to the dietary supplement current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. “This seizure underscores the agency’s commitment to taking aggressive action when manufacturers distribute adulterated dietary supplements that have the potential to put consumers at risk,” said Melinda K. Plaisier, the FDA’s Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. “The FDA has a variety of enforcement tools at its disposal, and when products don’t comply with FDA regulations, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action.” The FDA inspection at Life Rising found that its dietary supplements were prepared, packed, and/or held under conditions that violated CGMP regulations. Among other observed deficiencies, the company failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of each finished batch of dietary supplement, and for limits on certain types of contamination, to ensure the quality of the supplement. The company also lacked written procedures for pest control and for maintaining, cleaning, and sanitizing equipment and/or surfaces that came in contact with the dietary supplements, among other violations. Based on these CGMP violations, last month, the FDA issued an Administrative Detention Order to prevent these products from reaching consumers until they could be seized. Last month, the FDA also issued a for three Life Rising products (Life Rising Holder-W Holder Warmer capsules, Life Rising NECK-ND Neck Clear capsules, and HoliCare Metabolism Cleansing (MET-CLS) tablets) because those products may be contaminated with lead. These products were recalled by the company on May 2, just before the FDA’s safety alert. Lead exposure is extremely dangerous and can cause extensive damage to the nervous system and internal organs. In 2016, Life Rising certain dietary supplement products because of elevated lead levels, and in May 2017, the agency issued a to Life Rising citing CGMP violations. This action stems from a follow up inspection the FDA conducted to evaluate the company’s CGMP compliance. In light of the recalls and safety alerts, as well as the continuing violations of CGMP, the FDA discourages consumers from purchasing or using dietary supplement products bearing brand names Life Rising, Holicare, or HopeStream.

{"title": "Federal court issues decision holding that US Stem Cell clinics and owner adulterated and misbranded stem cell products in violation of the law", "date": "June 04, 2019", "contents": " U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro of the Southern District of Florida granted the government’s motion for summary judgment against US Stem Cell Clinic LLC, of Weston, Florida, and US Stem Cell Inc., of Sunrise, Florida, and their Chief Scientific Officer Kristin Comella, Ph.D. The court held that the defendants in that case adulterated and misbranded a stem cell drug product made from a patient’s adipose tissue. “Cell-based regenerative medicine holds significant medical opportunity, but those in this field who do not operate in compliance with the law can potentially cause serious harm to patients,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We support sound, scientific research and regulation of cell-based regenerative medicine. The FDA has advanced a comprehensive policy framework to promote the development and approval of regenerative medicine products. But at the same time, the FDA will continue to take action—such as issuing warning letters or initiating court cases—against  clinics that abuse the trust of patients and endanger their health with inadequate manufacturing conditions or by manufacturing and promoting products in ways that make them drugs under the law, but which have not been proven to be safe or effective for any use. It is our responsibility to promote and protect public health, and we take this responsibility seriously.” The U.S. Department of Justice, on FDA’s behalf, this action against US Stem Cell Clinic LLC and US Stem Cell Inc., and Comella in May 2018, seeking a permanent injunction to stop the defendants’ illegal behavior after several attempts to provide the clinic and the individual defendants the opportunity to work with the agency to come into compliance with FDA regulations and protect patients from harm. “In the case against US Stem Cell Clinic, the clinic and its leadership have put patients at serious risk through their disregard of the law and prior FDA warnings. This decision today is a victory for the FDA’s work to stop these bad actors and to protect patients,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “We are committed to continuing to pursue actions against those who put patients in harm’s way by marketing unapproved stem cell products that skirt FDA’s regulations and federal law.” The FDA initially raised concerns about US Stem Cell in a issued in 2017 for marketing stem cell products without FDA approval and for significant deviations from current good manufacturing practice requirements, following an FDA inspection of the facility that found that the company was administering its product intravenously or via other methods of administration to treat a variety of serious diseases or conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and pulmonary fibrosis. The FDA has not approved any biological products manufactured by US Stem Cell Clinic for any use. The clinic was also cited for its failure to establish and follow appropriate written procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of products purporting to be sterile, which puts patients at risk for infections. Following these steps, a U.S. court previously entered a consent decree of permanent injunction agreed to by the FDA and defendant Theodore Gradel, a former manager of US Stem Cell LLC that requires Mr. Gradel to notify the FDA if he intends to re-enter the biologics industry and to comply with any corrective actions ordered by the FDA. In a separate action, the FDA is also seeking a permanent injunction to stop California Stem Cell Treatment Center Inc., with locations in Rancho Mirage and Beverly Hills, California; Cell Surgical Network Corporation of Rancho Mirage, California; and Elliot B.

In addition, to date, the FDA has taken numerous other steps to bring clinics and other companies or individuals manufacturing stem cell products with known or potential violations into compliance by issuing warning letters, untitled letters and other letters of correspondence to firms. This case and other actions taken recently by the FDA support the agency’s , and the FDA’s risk-based approach to enforcement of cell-based regenerative medicine products, taking into account how products are being administered as well as the diseases and conditions for which they are intended to be used. The FDA has repeatedly noted that it does not intend to exercise such enforcement discretion for those products that pose reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns, such as US Stem Cell Clinic’s products.

{"title": "Statement on warning for women of childbearing age about possible safety risks of dietary supplements containing vinpocetine", "date": "June 03, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers about safety concerns regarding an ingredient called vinpocetine that is found in dietary supplements, specifically concerns about the use of this ingredient by women of childbearing age. According to data reviewed by the FDA, including a recent by the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) National Toxicology Program (NTP), consumption of vinpocetine is associated with adverse reproductive effects – in other words, vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development. These findings are particularly concerning since products containing vinpocetine are widely available for use by women of childbearing age. That’s why today we’re advising pregnant women and women who could become pregnant not to take vinpocetine. We are also advising firms marketing dietary supplements containing vinpocetine to evaluate their product labeling to ensure that it provides safety warnings against use by pregnant women and women who could become pregnant. Vinpocetine is a synthetically produced compound that is used in some products marketed as dietary supplements, either by itself or combined with other ingredients. Vinpocetine may be referred to on product labels as Vinca minor extract, lesser periwinkle extract, or common periwinkle extract. Dietary supplements containing vinpocetine are often marketed for uses that include enhanced memory, focus, or mental acuity; increased energy; and weight loss. Scientists who have studied the effects of vinpocetine on pregnant animals concluded that vinpocetine decreased fetal weight and increased the chances of a miscarriage. The blood levels of vinpocetine measured in the pregnant animals were similar to those reported in people after taking a single dose of vinpocetine, indicating that pregnant women may experience adverse effects from vinpocetine similar to those seen in the pregnant animals. In some countries outside of the U.S., vinpocetine is regulated as a prescription drug. When products like vinpocetine are sold as dietary supplements in the U.S., they have not been reviewed by the FDA under the safety and effectiveness standards that apply to drug products. This means that the FDA has not reviewed each vinpocetine product, or its labeling, before those products become available to consumers. In the 1990s, the FDA received several premarket safety submissions (known as new dietary ingredient notifications) for vinpocetine as an ingredient in dietary supplements. In 2016, we requested comment from stakeholders as part of an administrative proceeding to evaluate whether vinpocetine is legal for sale as a dietary supplement. With the results in NTP’s report, it was important to issue today’s warning because the availability of dietary supplement products containing vinpocetine has grown and the labels of vinpocetine products often have no warnings about the dangers of miscarriage and harm to fetal development. For the same reasons, the FDA will expedite completion of the administrative proceeding that we began in September 2016. The dietary supplement market is a growing industry, with sales multiplying ten-fold over the past 25 years and more than half of all Americans taking at least one dietary supplement on a regular basis. This expansion is one reason why earlier this year, the FDA announced new efforts to strengthen the regulation of dietary supplements by modernizing our regulatory framework. Today’s safety warning is just to adapt to the realities of the evolving dietary supplement industry. Protecting the public from unsafe dietary supplements remains a top priority for the FDA. We’ve also created a public-private partnership, the Botanical Safety Consortium, to promote scientific advances in evaluating the safety of botanical ingredients and mixtures in dietary supplements. In April, we introduced a new tool, the , to more quickly alert the public when we become aware of ingredients that appear to be unlawfully marketed in dietary supplements. And finally, just last month, with our stakeholders to discuss responsible innovation in the dietary supplements industry. These efforts, along with today’s announcement regarding vinpocetine, underscore how the FDA will continue to preserve access to safe, well-manufactured, and accurately labeled dietary supplements, while we protect the American public from potentially unsafe or otherwise unlawful products. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia", "date": "June 03, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved a new indication for the previously FDA-approved drug, Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients 18 years and older. The FDA initially approved Zerbaxa to treat complicated intra-abdominal infections and for complicated urinary tract infections. “A key global challenge we face as a public health agency is addressing the threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia are serious infections that can result in death in some patients. New therapies to treat these infections are important to meet patient needs because of increasing antimicrobial resistance. That’s why, among our other efforts to address antimicrobial resistance, we’re focused on facilitating the development of safe and effective new treatments to give patients more options to fight life-threatening infections.” HABP/VABP occur in patients in hospitals or other health care facilities and can be caused by a variety of bacteria. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HABP and VABP are currently the second most common type of hospital-acquired infection in the United States, and are a significant issue in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The safety and efficacy of Zerbaxa for the treatment of HABP/VABP, administered via injection, was demonstrated in a multinational, double-blind study that compared Zerbaxa to another antibacterial drug in 726 adult patients hospitalized with HABP/VABP. The study showed that mortality and cure rates were similar between Zerbaxa and the comparator treatment. The most common adverse reactions observed in the HABP/VABP trial among patients treated with Zerbaxa were elevated liver enzyme levels, renal impairment or failure, and diarrhea. Zerbaxa should not be used in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to components of Zerbaxa, as well as hypersensitivity to piperacillin/tazobactam or other members of the beta lactam class of antibacterial drugs. Zerbaxa received FDA’s (QIDP) designation for the treatment of HABP/VABP. The QIDP designation is given to antibacterial and antifungal drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. As part of QIDP designation, the Zerbaxa marketing application for the HABP/VABP indication was granted under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame. The FDA granted the approval of Zerbaxa for the treatment of HABP/VABP to Merck & Co., Inc.

{"title": "Statement on FDA’s request for information on requiring fixed-quantity blister packaging for certain opioid pain medicines to help decrease unnecessary exposure to opioids", "date": "May 30, 2019", "contents": " The opioid tragedy has become one of the defining public health crises of modern times. As the rates of opioid addiction and overdose continue to grow, addressing the opioid crisis has taken on more urgency. For the past few years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been focusing on decreasing unnecessary exposure to prescription opioids as a way to prevent new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; promoting the development of novel pain treatment therapies; increasing enforcement and carefully assessing the patient and public health benefits and risks of new opioid approvals. In recent months, the agency has been implementing important new that it sought and Congress provided in the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities – better known as the SUPPORT Act. The new law will help advance efforts to reduce unnecessary exposure to opioids and potentially lower the rate of new addiction. We know that for many people addicted to opioids, their first opioid exposure was a prescription opioid. We also know that patients are often prescribed significantly more opioid pills than they actually use following surgical procedures or other acute pain conditions for which opioids are prescribed. This excess supply of opioids provides opportunities for misuse, abuse, overdose and development of addiction, as well as the potential for these leftover pills to end up in the hands of a child, friend or relative for whom they aren’t intended. The FDA’s efforts to address the opioid crisis must focus on encouraging “right size” prescribing of opioid pain medication as well as reducing the number of people unnecessarily exposed to opioids, while ensuring appropriate access to address the medical needs of patients experiencing pain severe enough to warrant treatment with opioids. The SUPPORT Act allows the FDA to require special packaging for opioids and other drugs that pose a risk of abuse or overdose. Today, the FDA is opening a to solicit feedback on potential use of this new authority to require that certain immediate-release opioid analgesics be made available in fixed-quantity, unit-of-use blister packaging. According to published studies most patients used significantly fewer pills than they were prescribed for many common minimally or less-invasive surgical procedures as well as some common acute pain conditions treated in the primary care setting. Specifically, most of these patients appeared to use opioids for only one to three days following surgery and took 15 or fewer pills. Patients reported that they usually retained unused pills in unsecure locations, providing opportunities for later misuse, abuse, accidental poisoning, overdose and development of addiction. The available data suggests that if 5-, 10-, or 15-count unit-of-use blister package configurations of certain commonly-prescribed immediate-release opioid pain medications were made available, one or more of these options could be expected to meet the needs of many patients experiencing acute pain following a minimally or less-invasive medical procedure or other conditions commonly treated with opioid pain medications. The availability of these new packaging configurations could help prescribers to more carefully consider the amount of opioid pain medication they prescribe. These fixed-quantity unit-of-use blister packages could even become the default option for many common acute pain conditions for which opioid pain medications are commonly prescribed, where the evidence shows that shorter durations are clinically appropriate. Reducing the amount of unnecessary opioid pain medication prescribed will lead to fewer pills left in medicine cabinets that could be inappropriately accessed by family members or visitors, including children, and could potentially lower the rate of new opioid addiction. Importantly, these fixed-quantity unit-of-use blister packages would just be one option, and prescribers could continue to write opioid analgesic prescriptions in quantities they deem appropriate for their patients. The FDA is seeking feedback on the potential requirement outlined in today’s notice. Specifically, the agency would like comments on the potential public health impact of making fixed-quantity unit-of-use blister packages of certain opioid pain medications available for the treatment of acute pain. We’d also like feedback on which specific opioid or opioid-containing products are good candidates for blister package configurations as well the number of pills to be included in the configuration. We are also interested in hearing about the potential challenges associated with the proposal. To further advance the goal of rationalized prescribing – and help reduce the rate of opioid over-prescribing – the SUPPORT Act also strengthens the FDA’s current efforts to promote the development of evidence-based opioid prescribing guidelines for treating acute pain resulting from specific conditions or procedures. The FDA a contract to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) in August 2018 to help advance the development of such guidelines. As part of this work, NASEM will scan the landscape of existing opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines and examine how these guidelines were developed and any potential gaps in evidence for those guidelines; it also will outline the research needed to generate that additional evidence. We’ve set a goal for work to be completed by the end of this year. Earlier this month, we also launched a new awareness campaign called designed to encourage patients to properly dispose of excess prescription opioids from their homes when they’re no longer needed for their prescribed purpose. Our goal, through the step we’re taking today and the many complementary actions we’re taking to address the opioid crisis, is to promote more rational prescribing practices of opioids and reduce the rate of new addiction while maintaining appropriate access for patients who need these drugs.

{"title": "FDA puts company on notice for marketing unapproved stem cell products for treating serious conditions", "date": "May 30, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has sent an untitled letter to of Scottsdale, Arizona, and its chief executive officer, David Greene, M.D. The company, through its affiliated centers or clinics throughout the U.S., offers unapproved stem cell products to treat a variety of diseases and conditions, such as Lyme disease, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, kidney failure and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The products offered by R3 Stem Cell, LLC are not approved by the FDA. The FDA has notified each of R3 Stem Cell, LLC’s more than 50 affiliate centers or clinics of this action. “We continue to see companies and individuals use questionable marketing campaigns to take advantage of vulnerable patients and their families with unproven claims about their unapproved stem cell products. The reality is that at this time, there isn’t enough evidence to support the use of stem cells for purposes other than reconstitution of blood formation and the immune system,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We’ve made it clear to the industry and the public that while we are taking a risk-based approach to regulatory actions, the FDA will continue to protect patients from the most egregious actors in this field. We will prioritize appropriate regulatory actions against those who place people’s health at risk by promoting unapproved products.” In the FDA’s review of the R3 Stem Cell, LLC website, the agency found that the company promotes stem cell therapies for numerous diseases or conditions, such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease, and directs patients with ALS, diabetes, kidney failure, Lyme disease, Parkinson’s disease and stroke to certain “R3 Stem Cell Centers of Excellence” for stem cell treatment. The untitled letter notes that the company advertises that a variety of other conditions can be treated at R3 Stem Cell Clinics, including rheumatoid arthritis, spinal stenosis, and trigeminal neuralgia (nerve pain). It appears that the products offered by the company would be regulated as drugs and biological products under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. Prior to marketing, such products require a demonstration that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses. Manufacturers who fail to comply with FDA requirements may be subject to enforcement action, such as seizure, injunction, or prosecution. “We encourage firms to engage with the FDA about regulatory oversight of this field and work with the agency for appropriate development, including designing clinical trials, to explore the safety and potential benefits of these products. We intend to step up our oversight of those sponsors who have not engaged the regulatory process in the proper development of their stem cell products that are regulated as drugs, devices, and/or biological products under the statutes and existing regulations, and whose products create more significant potential risks because of the way that they’re manipulated or delivered,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Over the past year, the FDA has sent 46 manufacturers and health care professionals regulatory correspondence, including today’s untitled letter.  We have also sent warning letters, and we have two court cases pending. We’re committed to taking appropriate steps to address those that jeopardize public health.” As highlighted in 2017 with the release of the FDA’s , the FDA is applying a risk-based regulatory approach to the oversight of regenerative medicine products, taking into account how products are being administered as well as the diseases and conditions for which they are intended. The agency noted that it intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain products until November 2020 with respect to the FDA’s investigational new drug application and premarket approval requirements when the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns. The FDA offers opportunities for engagement between potential manufacturers and the agency, such as through the program, to facilitate product development. It also encourages the use of its expedited programs whenever applicable, in addition to the collaborative development of products as discussed in a perspective authored by the FDA.

{"title": "FDA announces Project Facilitate to assist physicians seeking access to unapproved therapies for patients with cancer", "date": "June 03, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Oncology Center of Excellence announced a new pilot program to assist oncology health care professionals in requesting access to unapproved therapies for patients with cancer. A new call center called Project Facilitate will be a single point of contact where FDA oncology staff will help physicians treating patients with cancer through the process to submit an Expanded Access request for an individual patient, including follow-up of patient outcomes. “For decades, the FDA has been deeply committed to helping facilitate access to investigational medical products for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases, while also protecting patients and helping them to be able to make informed decisions with their physicians. The first option for patients who have exhausted available treatments is to enroll in a clinical trial, but when that is not an option, we support Expanded Access and are exploring ways to make it easier for patients, their families and health care professionals to understand the process and how to access investigational therapies,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The FDA has been working diligently to improve the Expanded Access framework, including development of an updated and more streamlined application form, but despite recent improvements, we understand that for many patients or health care professionals, especially those not familiar with the Expanded Access program, the process may appear confusing or burdensome. Today’s launch of Project Facilitate is part of our continued commitment to Expanded Access and we hope that this pilot program will simplify the process for oncologists, and ultimately benefit patients.” The FDA recently issued encouraging companies to broaden their eligibility criteria to allow more patients with cancer to participate in clinical trials. But in those cases where patients do not fit the trial requirements or live too far from a trial site, health care professionals can request permission from the FDA to treat a patient with an investigational medical product through Expanded Access. Expanded Access is a pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening or serious disease or condition to gain access to an investigational medical product (drug, biologic or medical device) for treatment outside of clinical trials when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options available. Because investigational medical products have not yet been approved or cleared by the FDA and have therefore not been found safe and effective for their specific use, part of the FDA’s role in granting Expanded Access requests is helping weigh whether the potential benefit of the investigational treatment justifies the potential risks. To make a request, the patient’s physician will contact the pharmaceutical company to ask for its agreement that it will provide the medical product. The company has the right to approve or disapprove the physician’s request. The FDA authorizes the vast majority of these requests. This process can be perceived as complex to navigate, particularly for oncologists who don’t have experience working with clinical trials or these types of requests. “Ultimately, a patient cannot submit an application for an investigational medical product; only a qualified physician is able to officially make the request. The new Project Facilitate call center aims to help in making these requests as streamlined and efficient as possible for physicians who would like to request access to investigational therapies for their patients with cancer,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Through this pilot program, experienced FDA oncology staff will be available to support physicians and other healthcare professionals with their questions, assist in filling out the appropriate paperwork and acting as a facilitator for the process.” The new pilot call center will enhance the FDA’s efforts to gather data on the Expanded Access program to help improve the process for physicians and patients. Prior to the pilot program launch, Expanded Access requests for patients with cancer arrived at multiple places within the FDA and were forwarded separately to FDA oncology or hematology divisions. The pilot program includes a central office for oncology requests so that the FDA can follow up on individual requests and gather data, such as how many patients received the investigational medical products and if not, why the requests were denied. The FDA can use this data to determine how the process is benefiting patients and health care professionals. In addition, the data could assist in encouraging sponsors to open clinical trials to study drugs for additional indications. The FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence, in conjunction with the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, held a on May 16, 2019, to obtain input regarding gaps in patient and health care professionals’ knowledge of the current system for Expanded Access requests and to gain feedback on the Project Facilitate pilot program. The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an independent 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization created by Congress for the purpose of advancing regulatory science to support the FDA’s mission, recently updated its web resource designed to educate patients and health care professionals about the FDA Expanded Access process.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for episodic cluster headache that reduces the frequency of attacks", "date": "June 04, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Emgality (galcanezumab-gnlm) solution for injection for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in adults. “Emgality provides patients with the first FDA-approved drug that reduces the frequency of attacks of episodic cluster headache, an extremely painful and often debilitating condition,” said Eric Bastings, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The FDA is committed to continuing to work with drug developers to bring treatments for unmet medical needs to patients.” Cluster headache is a form of headache that produces extreme pain and tends to occur in clusters, often at the same time(s) of the day, for several weeks to months. The headaches are accompanied by symptoms that may include: bloodshot eyes, excessive tearing of the eyes, drooping of the eyelids, runny nose and/or nasal congestion and facial sweating. Some people experience restlessness and agitation. Cluster headache attacks may strike several times a day, generally lasting between 15 minutes and three hours. The effectiveness of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache was demonstrated in a clinical trial that compared the drug to placebo in 106 patients. The trial measured the average number of cluster headaches per week for three weeks and compared the average changes from baseline in the Emgality and placebo groups. During the three-week period, patients taking Emgality experienced 8.7 fewer weekly cluster headache attacks than they did at baseline, compared to 5.2 fewer attacks for patients on placebo. There is a risk of hypersensitivity reactions with Emgality use. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, treatment should be discontinued. Hypersensitivity reactions could occur days after administration and may be prolonged. The most common side effect reported by participants in the clinical trials was injection site reactions. Emgality is given by patient self-injection. It was first approved by the FDA in September 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The FDA granted the approval of Emgality to Eli Lilly. The FDA granted this application Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.

{"title": "FDA permits marketing of first diagnostic test to aid in detecting prosthetic joint infections", "date": "May 23, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted marketing of the Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit as an aid for the detection of periprosthetic joint infection (infection around a joint replacement) in the synovial (lubricant) fluid of patients being evaluated for revision surgery, which is surgery performed to replace or compensate for a failed implant. “Prior to today’s authorization, there were no FDA-authorized diagnostic tests specifically designed to help health care professionals determine whether the inflammation around a prosthetic joint was due to an infection or another cause,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “With this test, health care professionals now have an additional option available to aid their clinical assessment as to whether the patient has an infection and requires revision surgery. Whereas before surgeons may have opted for surgery when the presence of an infection was unclear, with this test, they have more information and could potentially reduce patient risk by avoiding unnecessary revision operations for replacement joints.” Joint replacement is a surgical treatment option for people with severe joint damage, including the knees or hips. During a joint replacement surgery, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of the joint and replaces it with a prosthetic joint implant. Potential complications of joint replacement include scarring, inflammation, blood clots and infections. If an infection occurs, it can lead to pain, redness, swelling and decreased joint function and potentially require antibiotics and revision surgery to treat the infection and install a new prosthetic implant. Physicians typically evaluate for potential infections using X-ray images or laboratory analysis of joint fluid, which can take days for results. The Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit detects proteins called human alpha defensins in the synovial fluid of patients with a total joint replacement in approximately 10 minutes. Alpha defensins are antimicrobial proteins released by activated neutrophils (white blood cells) in response to infection. The Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit is intended as an aid to determine whether there is an infection present in synovial fluid. It is not intended to identify a specific type of infection. The test results are also intended to be used in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic findings to aid in a patient’s diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection. The FDA reviewed data from a clinical study that analyzed 305 prospective synovial fluid samples collected from individuals with a total knee or hip joint replacement who were being evaluated for revision surgery. The study showed that 89.5% of subjects with an infection diagnosis based on standard of care criteria were also identified as positive for alpha defensin by the Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit. The FDA reviewed data for the Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, which determine the requirements for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of tests to detect and measure non-microbial analytes (substances) that aid in the detection and identification of localized human infections. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these tests. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Synovasure Lateral Flow Test Kit to CD Diagnostics Inc.

{"title": "FDA approves innovative gene therapy to treat pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease and leading genetic cause of infant mortality ", "date": "May 24, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi), the first gene therapy approved to treat children less than two years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most severe form of SMA and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. “Today’s approval marks another milestone in the transformational power of gene and cell therapies to treat a wide range of diseases,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “With each new approval, we see this exciting area of science continue to move beyond the concept phase into reality. The potential for gene therapy products to change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition, or worse, death, provides hope for the future. The FDA will continue to support the progress in this field by helping to expedite the development of products for unmet medical needs through the use of review pathways designed to advance innovative, safe and effective treatment options.” SMA is a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The gene encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein – a protein found throughout the body, which is critical for the maintenance and function of specialized nerve cells, called motor neurons. Motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord control muscle movement throughout the body. If there is not enough functional SMN protein, then the motor neurons die, leading to debilitating and often fatal muscle weakness. SMA caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene is generally classified into several subtypes, based on the age of onset and severity; infantile-onset SMA is the most severe and most common subtype. Children with this condition have problems holding their head up, swallowing and breathing. These symptoms may be present at birth or may present by the age of 6 months. “Children with SMA experience difficulty performing essential functions of life. Most children with this disease do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Patients with SMA now have another treatment option to minimize the progression of SMA and improve survival. This approval demonstrates the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine and the FDA’s commitment to supporting and helping expedite the development of these products.” Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of children less than two years of age with SMA. The product is an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy that targets the cause of SMA. The vector delivers a fully functional copy of human SMN gene into the target motor neuron cells. A one-time intravenous administration of Zolgensma results in expression of the SMN protein in a child’s motor neurons, which improves muscle movement and function, and survival of a child with SMA. Dosing is determined based on the weight of the patient. The safety and effectiveness of Zolgensma is based on an ongoing clinical trial and a completed clinical trial involving a total of 36 pediatric patients with infantile-onset SMA between the ages of approximately 2 weeks and 8 months at study entry. The primary evidence of effectiveness is based on results from the 21 patients treated with Zolgensma in the ongoing clinical trial. In this trial, there are 19 remaining patients, who range in age from 9.4 to 18.5 months; 13 of these 19 patients are at least 14 months of age. Compared to the natural history of patients with infantile-onset SMA, patients treated with Zolgensma also demonstrated significant improvement in their ability to reach developmental motor milestones (e.g., head control and the ability to sit without support). The most common side effects of Zolgensma are elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Zolgensma has a boxed warning that acute serious liver injury can occur. Patients with pre existing liver impairment may be at higher risk of experiencing serious liver injury. Clinical examination and laboratory tests to assess liver function should be completed prior to treatment with Zolgensma, and patients’ liver function should be monitored for at least three months after Zolgensma administration. Certain vaccines are contraindicated for patients on a substantially immunosuppressive steroid dose. Therefore, caregivers should consult with their healthcare professional to determine if adjustments to the patient’s vaccination schedule are necessary to accommodate concomitant corticosteroid administration.

{"title": "FDA approves first PI3K inhibitor for breast cancer", "date": "May 24, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Piqray (alpelisib) tablets, to be used in combination with the FDA-approved endocrine therapy fulvestrant, to treat postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer (as detected by an FDA-approved test) following progression on or after an endocrine-based regimen. The FDA also approved the companion diagnostic test, therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit, to detect the PIK3CA mutation in a tissue and/or a liquid biopsy. Patients who are negative by the therascreen test using the liquid biopsy should undergo tumor biopsy for PIK3CA mutation testing. “Piqray is the first PI3K inhibitor to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in treating patients with this type of breast cancer. The ability to target treatment to a patient’s specific genetic mutation or biomarker is becoming increasingly common in cancer treatment, and companion diagnostic tests assist oncologists in selecting patients who may benefit from these targeted treatments,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “For this approval, we employed some of our newer regulatory tools to streamline reviews without compromising the quality of our assessment. This drug is the first novel drug approved under the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program. We also used the updated Assessment Aid, a multidisciplinary review template that helps focus our written review on critical thinking and consistency and reduces time spent on administrative tasks.” Metastatic breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other organs in the body (most often the bones, lungs, liver or brain). When breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, patients may be treated with anti-hormonal treatment (also called endocrine therapy), alone or in combination with other medicines, or chemotherapy. The efficacy of Piqray was studied in the SOLAR-1 trial, a randomized trial of 572 postmenopausal women and men with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose cancer had progressed while on or after receiving an aromatase inhibitor. Results from the trial showed the addition of Piqray to fulvestrant significantly prolonged progression- free survival (median of 11 months vs. 5.7 months) in patients whose tumors had a PIK3CA mutation. Common side effects of Piqray are high blood sugar levels, increase in creatinine, diarrhea, rash, decrease in lymphocyte count in the blood, elevated liver enzymes, nausea, fatigue, low red blood cell count, increase in lipase (enzymes released by the pancreas), decreased appetite, stomatitis, vomiting, weight loss, low calcium levels, aPTT prolonged (blood clotting taking longer to occur than it should), and hair loss. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients taking Piqray for severe hypersensitivity reactions (intolerance). Patients are warned of potentially severe skin reactions (rashes that may result in peeling and blistering of skin or mucous membranes like the lips and gums). Health care professionals are advised not to initiate treatment in patients with a history of severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patients on Piqray have reported severe hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and the safety of Piqray in patients with Type 1 or uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes has not been established. Before initiating treatment with Piqray, health care professionals are advised to check fasting glucose and HbA1c, and to optimize glycemic control. Patients should be monitored for pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (inflammation of lung tissue) and diarrhea during treatment. Piqray must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Piqray is the first new drug application (NDA) for a new molecular entity approved under the pilot program, which permits the FDA to begin analyzing key efficacy and safety datasets prior to the official submission of an application, allowing the review team to begin their review and communicate with the applicant earlier. Piqray also used the , a multidisciplinary review template intended to focus the FDA’s written review on critical thinking and consistency and reduce time spent on administrative tasks. With these two pilot programs, today’s approval of Piqray comes approximately three months ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) VI deadline of August 18, 2019.

{"title": "Statement from Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D., and Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, on policies designed to capture more data to better understand effects of prescription drugs in pregnant and nursing women", "date": "May 08, 2019", "contents": " It can be a challenge for health care professionals and patients to find quality scientific information about the safety of drugs and biological products when used during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Ethical challenges often arise in studying women in these populations as there are valid concerns about maternal and fetal safety. For example, if a woman who is currently breastfeeding starts an investigational drug for a disease or condition, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of the study because the risks of the exposure to the drug in the breastfeeding infant may outweigh the benefits. We also know that there are differences in how medicines affect men compared to women, and pregnancy can often add to these differences. But because of the challenges in studying this area, often, women and their health care professionals must make decisions about whether to use a drug during pregnancy or lactation even when relevant safety data are scant or lacking. The FDA is committed to advancing and promoting women’s health and continues to engage in an open public dialogue with patient groups, medical experts and other federal partners to address the gap in scientific knowledge for women during this important phase of their lives. Today, we’re issuing two draft guidances, which, when finalized, will provide new and updated information for companies designed to increase the availability of high-quality safety information in drugs used during pregnancy or lactation. The first draft guidance, , will, when finalized, provide recommendations for sponsors conducting clinical lactation studies. The FDA has required these studies under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act under some circumstances and is considering additional circumstances in which they may be recommended. Today’s draft guidance builds upon our previous guidance from 2005 (“Clinical Lactation Studies--Study Design, Data Analysis, and Recommendations for Labeling”) and streamlines and simplifies our recommendations for sponsors on these types of studies. The revised guidance, when finalized, will help to work toward overcoming the knowledge gap that health care professionals and women may face in making decisions about their health and the health of their baby. For example, we’re recommending when companies should conduct a lactation study when a drug is expected to be used in women of reproductive age, or if a new indication is being sought for an approved drug and there is evidence of use or anticipated use of the drug by women who are breastfeeding. In addition, the draft guidance provides information about ethical considerations for when lactating women can potentially participate in a clinical trial. In developing this draft guidance, we factored in discussions at where we considered how data from these studies can inform the safety of a drug when used during lactation, including whether it’s passed through breastmilk to a nursing infant, or there are any changes in a women’s body as a result of her lactation that could otherwise impact the safety or efficacy of a drug. We’re also announcing a second draft guidance, which, when finalized, will outline our recommendations on how to design studies and leverage other forms of data, including real-world data, to assess the outcomes of pregnancies in women taking to FDA-regulated drugs and biological products during pregnancy. The Postapproval Pregnancy Safety Studies draft guidance broadens the scope of methods used in collection of safety information for drugs and biological products used during pregnancy to include database studies such as claims or electronic health records, case-control studies, population-based surveillance and other pharmacovigilance methods. The recommendations in this draft guidance reflect discussions and recommendations received during a two-day workshop convened by the FDA in 2014, Study Approaches and Methods to Evaluate the Safety of Drugs and Biological Products During Pregnancy in the Post-Approval Setting, as well as FDA review. When finalized, this guidance replaces our 2002 guidance, Establishing Pregnancy Exposure Registries. Both draft guidances announced today are consistent with the recommendations made by the . The 21st Century Cures Act established this task force to identify and report on gaps in knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for pregnant women and lactating women. The task force includes representatives from federal agencies, including the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. Non-federal members include representatives from industry and other relevant organizations. The draft guidances are an additional step the agency is taking toward getting women who are pregnant or breastfeeding important safety information about their medications, so they can make informed decisions about their health and the health of their babies. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D., on policy advancements to help bring interchangeable biosimilars to market", "date": "May 10, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plays an important role in helping to address the high cost of medicines through the development of science-based policies that can improve competition and patient access to safe and effective, high-quality and lower cost generic drugs, biosimilars and interchangeable biologics. Today, the FDA is taking a significant action that will help promote competition in the biologic market by providing on the pathway for “interchangeable” biologics, which may be substituted without the involvement of the prescriber, similar to how generic drugs are routinely substituted for brand name drugs when they are prescribed for patients. Biologics provide important treatment options for patients with serious diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The FDA’s final guidance on interchangeability will provide clarity for developers who want to demonstrate that their proposed biological product meets the statutory interchangeability standard under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). In the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), Congress created an approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA approved biological brand (or reference) product. This pathway is intended to benefit patients by making more treatment options available through biosimilar and interchangeable products, by increasing access to life-saving medications and potentially lowering health care costs through competition. Because well-functioning biosimilar and interchangeable pathways are critical to the agency’s broader efforts to improve competition, the FDA has developed and is working to implement a that includes a suite of ongoing efforts to encourage innovation and competition among biologics and the development of biosimilars. Today’s final guidance gives an overview of important scientific considerations in demonstrating interchangeability with a reference product and explains the scientific recommendations for an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Once an application or supplement seeking licensure as an interchangeable product is submitted, the FDA will approve the biological product as interchangeable with the reference product if the information submitted in the application or the supplement is sufficient to meet the applicable statutory standard: among other things, that the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product and can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. The guidance also explains potential ways to address the BPCI Act requirement for interchangeability that, for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product will not be greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. The final interchangeability guidance is informed by the FDA’s cumulative experience providing development-stage advice to sponsors of proposed interchangeable products. The FDA meets regularly with sponsors of proposed interchangeable products through the agency’s Biosimilar Product Development Program. The agency also considered the numerous comments on the draft interchangeability guidance and made changes to provide increased clarity to stakeholders. Our rigorous scientific standards for approval will be maintained for interchangeable biologics and should serve as assurance to health care professionals and patients that they can be confident in the safety and effectiveness of both interchangeable products and biosimilar products, just as they would be for reference products. Separately, and of particular importance to the millions of Americans with diabetes, the final interchangeability guidance will help enable biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products to come to market in the future. There are currently no approved insulin products that can be substituted at the pharmacy level. But, under the BPCI Act, on March 23, 2020, insulin and other biological products that were approved as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will be deemed biological products licensed and regulated under the PHS Act. After this transition, the FDA will be able to license biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products that meet the requirements of the PHS Act, and today’s guidance will, among other things, help developers seek licensure for such products. An interchangeable insulin product may be substituted at the pharmacy, potentially leading to increased access and lower costs for patients. For chronically used biologic medications patients get at the pharmacy, such as insulin, the ability to have a licensed interchangeable that can be substituted at the pharmacy without the intervention of the prescribing health care professional – much like how generic drugs are routinely substituted for brand name drugs – could be integral to the success of reducing drug prices for patients. , the agency will hear from patients, advocates and industry about what factors the agency should consider when evaluating data and other information submitted by an applicant, including from analytical and clinical studies, to determine whether an insulin product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. We also expect to hear stakeholder feedback on whether certain insulin products – for example, those that use insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous infusion among the approved uses – raise unique scientific considerations that we should be considering when evaluating biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products. And importantly, we’ll also be seeking input directly from patients about their experience with insulin products and this input will inform the FDA’s approach to implementing the regulatory pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. In advancing the broader policy efforts for biosimilar and interchangeable products, soon we will also be issuing additional guidance on the agency’s recommendations on the design and evaluation of comparative analytical studies and other important scientific considerations needed to support a demonstration that a biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. This data will help build the foundation for a development program for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product. To date, the FDA has already licensed 19 biosimilar products, which should help strengthen competition in the biologic market. This, and other work we are undertaking as part of the Biosimilars Action Plan, is building a solid regulatory foundation for the review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologics designed to improve patient access to lower-cost options. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first anticoagulant (blood thinner) for pediatric patients to treat potentially life-threatening blood clots", "date": "May 16, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Fragmin (dalteparin sodium) injection, for subcutaneous use, to reduce the recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric patients one month of age and older. VTE can include deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins of the leg) and pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), which can lead to death. “Most children who have VTE are fighting a serious underlying primary illness such as cancer or congenital heart disease. Not only are they fighting a serious illness, having a condition like VTE can then lead to significant complications and even death,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Prior to this approval, there had been no FDA-approved therapies to treat VTE in pediatric patients. Given the unmet need, we granted the Fragmin application priority review and today we are approving it as the first anticoagulant (blood thinner) indicated for pediatric patients. We remain committed to advancing treatments for children with unmet medical needs.” VTE usually develops as a secondary complication of underlying clinical conditions such as a venous catheter, cancer, infection, congenital heart disease, and trauma or surgery. Pediatric VTE is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, recurrent VTE and post-thrombotic syndrome (damage to vein). Fragmin was initially approved by the FDA in 1994 for adults and is a type of heparin, which works as an anticoagulant. The efficacy of Fragmin in children was based on a single trial with 38 pediatric patientswith symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Patients were treated with Fragmin for up to three months, with starting doses by age and weight. At study completion, 21 patients achieved resolution of the qualifying VTE, seven patients showed regression, two patients showed no change, no patients experienced progression of the VTE and one patient experienced recurrence of VTE. Common side effects of patients taking Fragmin are bleeding, including hemorrhage (heavy discharge of blood from a blood vessel), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), hematoma (collection of blood) or pain at the injection site and transient elevation of transaminases (elevated level of liver enzymes). Health care professionals are advised to use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage and monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. Health care professionals are warned not to use benzyl alcohol preservative multiple-dose formulations in infants as they contain benzyl alcohol and should not be used. Patients are advised to have blood count laboratory tests periodically. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients closely for bleeding when administering Fragmin to patients who currently take anticoagulants. Patients at risk for VTE may receive certain treatments or interventions to help reduce the likelihood of the formation of blood clots (known as thromboprophylaxis), including taking anticoagulants. The label for Fragmin contains a boxed warning to alert health care professionals and patients that epidural or spinal hematomas (accumulation of blood that can mechanically compress the spinal cord) may occur in patients who are anticoagulated due to taking certain medications called low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia (injection near the spine) or undergoing spinal puncture (removing spinal fluid for testing). These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Health care professionals are advised to consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures as patients may be at a higher risk of developing VTE. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters, use of other drugs that affect hemostasis at the same time when using Fragmin, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors and other anticoagulants; history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures; and a history of spinal deformity or surgery. The optimal timing between the administration of Fragmin and neuraxial procedures is not known. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Health care professionals are advised to consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. The FDA granted this application designation. Pfizer holds the application for Fragmin.

Ellison for the Southern District of Texas signed and entered a consent decree of permanent injunction, ordering a Texas-based company and its owners to stop producing compounded drugs intended to be sterile until the company complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other requirements. According to the complaint, despite previous warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Pharm D Solutions, LLC, as well as the company’s owners, Luis R. De Leon and Juan C. De Leon, continued to violate the law, putting patients at risk. “We understand that compounded drugs can be important for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by FDA-approved drug products, and we’re continuing efforts to advance policies to help further improve the quality of compounded products,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “These drugs are not approved by the FDA and have not been evaluated for safety or efficacy, so when they’re not appropriately compounded, they have the potential to cause patients harm. We’ll continue taking enforcement actions, like the one we’re taking today, to ensure that these companies and products do not put patient health at risk.” The consent decree requires Pharm D Solutions to cease all sterile compounding operations and distribution until it completes corrective actions, to ensure the company and its facility are in compliance with the FD&C Act, as well as recall all drugs intended to be sterile currently on the market. Under the consent decree, Pharm D may not resume sterile compounding operations until it establishes and implements, among other things, a comprehensive quality control system and receives authorization from the FDA. “Despite previous warnings and promises to make corrections, Pharm D Solutions and its owners placed patients and their health at significant risk. Compounders must follow quality manufacturing practices to ensure consumers are not exposed to potentially harmful drugs,” said Donald D. Ashley, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s action underscores the FDA’s continued commitment to taking appropriate enforcement actions against compounders and outsourcing facilities that violate the law and fail to adhere to important product and patient safety requirements.” The government alleges that Pharm D Solutions manufactured and distributed drugs, including drugs that were intended to be sterile, that were adulterated because the drugs were made under insanitary conditions and in violation of current good manufacturing practice requirements under the FD&C Act. Drugs prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions may have been contaminated with filth or rendered otherwise harmful to patients. Additionally, the complaint alleges that some products were adulterated because they had strengths different from what they were represented to possess. According to the complaint, Pharm D Solutions also manufactured and distributed unapproved new drugs because the products did not follow all statutory requirements for outsourcing facilities. Some of Pharm D Solutions’s drugs were also misbranded because they did not include adequate directions for use. The FDA conducted an initial of Pharm D Solutions in May and June 2015 that resulted in a for insanitary conditions and other violations of the FD&C Act. The FDA conducted a follow-up in August 2018. On September 10, 2018, following FDA’s recommendation, Pharm D Solutions all unexpired drugs intended to be sterile and agreed to cease sterile operations until it made adequate corrections at its facility. The company resumed sterile operations on October 8, 2018, but again agreed to cease sterile operations on November 9, 2018 at FDA’s recommendation. However, Pharm D Solutions did not recall all unexpired drugs intended to be sterile, and the agency health care professionals and patients not to use purportedly sterile drugs produced by the company. Despite the FDA’s warnings, Pharm D Solutions again resumed compounding purportedly sterile drugs in January 2019. The U.S. Department of Justice filed the complaint on behalf of the FDA.

{"title": "FDA Warns Against the Use of Unauthorized Devices for Diabetes Management ", "date": "May 17, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning patients and health care professionals of risks associated with the use of unapproved or unauthorized devices for diabetes management, including continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pumps and automated insulin dosing systems. In the issued today, the agency noted that the use of unapproved or unauthorized devices could result in inaccurate blood glucose (sugar) measurements or unsafe insulin dosing, which can lead to injury requiring medical intervention or even death. “Millions of Americans use continuous glucose monitors and insulin delivery devices to monitor and treat their diabetes. Because of the complexity of these devices and the life-saving care they provide, it’s important that patients are aware of the risks that arise when they’re not used as intended or when they use devices not authorized for sale in the U.S. By using products that have not been reviewed by the agency for safety and effectiveness, patients with diabetes may be putting themselves at risk for serious injury or even death,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s warning is part of our ongoing public health commitment to protect patients and communicate with the public when we become aware of issues stemming from the use, or misuse, of medical devices.” There are many types of devices that patients use to manage diabetes. A continuous glucose monitoring system uses a sensor and transmitter to continuously track a patient’s glucose levels at all times. An insulin pump is a small computerized device that delivers insulin through a catheter (a small, flexible tube) placed under a person’s skin throughout the day. An automated insulin dosing system is a system that is intended to automatically deliver insulin doses based on glucose measurements from a continuous glucose monitoring system. Some of these diabetes management devices may be reviewed by the FDA as a whole system or they may be reviewed to be compatible with other FDA authorized components, such as integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems. This is known as interoperability, which allows patients to safely tailor their diabetes management to their individual preferences by choosing devices that are authorized by the FDA to work together. The FDA is aware of manufacturers illegally marketing unauthorized devices for diabetes management, which have not been reviewed by the agency for safety and effectiveness. Companies are also illegally marketing components, such as unauthorized continuous glucose monitors that some patients may integrate into unauthorized automated insulin dosing systems. Additionally, the FDA is aware of patients combining devices or components that are not intended for use with other devices. When devices that are not intended for use with other devices are combined or when unauthorized devices are used, new risks are introduced that have not been properly evaluated by the FDA for safety. Patient use of unauthorized diabetes management devices, alone or in conjunction with other devices, could result in inaccurate glucose level readings or unsafe insulin dosing, which can lead to risks requiring medical intervention, such as severe low blood sugar, coma, diabetic ketoacidosis (buildup of acids in blood) and death. The FDA is aware that patients may choose to create these systems or purchase unauthorized or unapproved components or systems because of personal preference or for cost reasons. The agency is concerned that patients may not fully be aware of the risks of using components or systems not reviewed by the FDA. The agency has received a report of a serious adverse event in which a patient’s use of an illegally marketed continuous glucose monitoring system along with an unauthorized automated insulin dosing system resulted in insulin overdose requiring medical attention. The FDA recommends that patients talk with their doctor about appropriate diabetes management devices for their needs and to only use devices and components that have been reviewed by the agency for safety and effectiveness. Patients who are concerned about the cost or availability of FDA-reviewed systems, should talk with their doctor and insurance provider about coverage and appropriate alternative options. The FDA recognizes that patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, prefer to have multiple treatment and management options that can be tailored to fit their specific needs. The agency has been working to review and authorize diabetes management devices that patients can tailor, such as the , and is committed to continuing to streamline regulatory pathways to promote innovation and patient access to these types of products. As part of the FDA’s , the FDA is committed to monitoring the safety of medical devices throughout a product’s total lifecycle and alerting the public when safety issues are identified, such as the agency’s recent communication regarding purchasing As part of this critical work, the FDA will continue to closely monitor reports of adverse events associated with the use of unauthorized devices for diabetes management and will keep the public informed if new information becomes available. The agency encourages patients and health care professionals to report adverse events to , the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.

The company has four registered outsourcing facilities located in Memphis, Tenn.; Cleveland, Miss.; Sugar Land, Texas and Dayton, N.J.  According to the complaint, despite previous warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and repeated promises from PharMedium to correct deficiencies, PharMedium continued to violate the law. “PharMedium exposed patients across the United States to risk of receiving a harmful drug, which we find unacceptable,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We will continue to take appropriate enforcement actions when compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities produce drugs under substandard conditions or use inappropriate practices that could lead to serious harm to patients.” The consent decree prohibits PharMedium and the other defendants from, among other things, manufacturing, holding, or distributing PharMedium’s drugs at or from its Tennessee facility until it completes corrective actions and receives authorization from the FDA.  The company has ceased operations at its Mississippi facility, and its Texas and New Jersey facilities must, among other things, hire an independent expert to review PharMedium’s operations at these facilities to ensure compliance with the law. In the complaint, the government alleges that PharMedium manufactured and distributed drugs intended to be sterile such as oxytocin and morphine sulfate, that were adulterated because the drugs were made under insanitary conditions and in violation of current good manufacturing practice requirements under the FD&C Act. Drugs prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions may have been contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health.

The Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG are the first devices cleared for extragenital diagnostic testing of these infections via the throat and rectum. These tests were previously only cleared for testing urine, vaginal and endocervical samples. “Prior to today, there were no chlamydia or gonorrhea tests cleared for use on samples from the throat and rectum. The availability of these two tests will fill an unmet public health need, by allowing for more screening,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “It is best for patients if both of these sexually transmitted infections are caught and treated right away, as significant complications can occur if left untreated. Today’s clearances provide a mechanism for more easily diagnosing these infections.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s , the rate of sexually transmitted infections is steadily increasing, with an estimated 1.7 million cases of chlamydia and more than 500,000 cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2017 alone. Both infections can be contracted through vaginal, anal or oral intercourse. Typically, both infections can be easily treated, but if left untreated, both infections can cause serious complications for patients, including infertility. The Aptima Combo 2 Assay and Xpert CT/NG were reviewed through the (510(k)) pathway. A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device. In its evaluation of the devices, the FDA reviewed clinical data collected through a cross-sectional study coordinated by the , which is funded and supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The study was a collaborative, multi-site clinical study of more than 2,500 patients that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of multiple commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis from throat and rectal sites. The results of this study, along with other information reviewed by the FDA, demonstrated that the Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG for extragenital specimens are safe and effective for extragenital testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea. The FDA granted clearance of Aptima Combo 2 Assay to Hologic, Inc. The FDA granted clearance of the Xpert CT/NG to Cepheid.

{"title": "FDA authorizes marketing of first diagnostic test for detecting Zika virus antibodies", "date": "May 23, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of a diagnostic test to detect Zika virus immunoglobulin (IgM) antibodies in human blood. The ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA is the first Zika diagnostic test the FDA has allowed to be marketed in the U.S.; previously, tests for detecting Zika virus IgM antibodies—including the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA—had been authorized only for emergency use under the FDA’s (EUA) authority. “At the onset of the Zika virus outbreak, when little was known about the disease or how to diagnose it, the FDA worked quickly with manufacturers to encourage the development of diagnostic tests and ensure they were available using our emergency use authorities,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Today’s marketing authorization is a great demonstration of the FDA’s work to protect the public health in emergency response situations. We ensured there were tests made available quickly under EUA, but we continued to work with diagnostic manufacturers to take the next step of ensuring products were FDA reviewed for safety and effectiveness and authorized under our traditional premarket authorities.” The Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. While many people with Zika virus infection experience no symptoms, the virus can pose potentially serious risks to the public health. Links between Zika virus infection and neurological complications (i.e., Guillain-Barré Syndrome), as well as microcephaly (abnormal smallness of the head) and other poor outcomes associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy, have increased the importance of having diagnostic tests available for Zika virus. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that limited local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission had been reported in the continental U.S. In 2018 and 2019, no local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission was reported in the continental U.S. The ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA is designed to identify proteins (antibodies) produced by the body's immune system when it tests for Zika virus infection in the blood. IgM antibodies indicate an early immune response. The FDA reviewed data from a clinical study of 807 test samples and a variety of analytical studies, which demonstrated that the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA was safe and effective at identifying IgM antibodies against Zika virus in blood. The ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA is for use only in patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection, and/or who meet the CDC’s Zika virus epidemiological criteria, such as history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active Zika transmission at the time of travel. Results of this test are intended to be used in conjunction with clinical observations, patient history, epidemiological information and other laboratory evidence to make patient management decisions. Negative results may be seen in specimens collected before day four after the onset of symptoms or after the window of detectable IgM closes, and therefore do not preclude the possibility of Zika virus infection, past or present. This test is not authorized by the FDA for testing blood or plasma donors. Prior to today, all of the available Zika tests had been authorized for use under an EUA, in which the agency allows use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products, in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agents. The FDA can only issue an EUA when specific criteria are met, including that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. With the marketing authorization granted for the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA today, the FDA has also revoked the EUA for this device, which was initially authorized for emergency use in 2016. In addition, the FDA is considering whether the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA test is an adequate, approved and available alternative to other currently available Zika virus antibody diagnostic tests available under EUAs. Currently, there are 18 other active EUAs for tests to diagnose Zika virus infection, four of which detect Zika virus antibodies like the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA. The FDA is communicating with the four EUA holders to gather information to evaluate whether the FDA should revoke the EUAs for these specific tests. Today’s marketing authorization does not impact the availability of the 14 other Zika nucleic acid diagnostics available under EUAs. The FDA reviewed data for the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA test through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that determine the requirements for demonstrating accuracy, reliability and effectiveness of tests intended to identify Zika virus antibodies. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA to InBios International, Inc.

{"title": "FDA alerts hospitals, laboratories and health care professionals about recall of Beckman Coulter blood test analyzers due to risk of inaccurate platelet analyzing results", "date": "May 23, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is hospitals, laboratories and providers of a Class 1 recall of Beckman Coulter DxH 800, DxH 600 and DxH 900 hematology analyzers—devices that run blood tests to help providers diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia (low red blood cell or hemoglobin count), infections, blood clotting problems, blood cancers and immune system disorders. This is an update to an urgent medical device correction letter first issued by the company in 2018, after the company received complaints of inaccurate blood platelet counts. Hematology analyzers run diagnostic tests that count the number of different types of red and white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin (oxygen levels) and hematocrit (volume of red blood cells in blood) levels in a blood sample. These diagnostic tests are often performed as part of routine patient check-ups and are commonly used as part of pre-surgical laboratory patient assessments to help providers assess if patients are suitable and healthy for surgery. They are also used to determine whether a patient with a very low platelet count needs platelet transfusion or to evaluate for potential bleeding and bruising disorders. Platelets help blood to clot, so a patient with a very low platelet count (severe thrombocytopenia) may be at an increased risk for life-threatening bleeding. The recall is related to the devices’ platelet analyzing function. Beckman Coulter has not received complaints that this issue impacts other reported parameters, including white blood cell count, white blood cell differential, red blood count or hemoglobin tests. “Inaccurate platelet counts may create serious health risks for patients,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “An inaccurate result may lead a provider to conclude a patient is suitable for surgery, when they may not be, to withhold platelet transfusion in patients who may need it, or to delay or miss the diagnosis of serious blood disorders. Because this may cause serious injury, or even death, to a patient, we are urging health care professionals to be aware of the potential for inaccurate diagnostic results with these analyzers and to take appropriate actions including the use of alternative diagnostic testing or confirming analyzer results with manual scanning or estimate of platelets. We are working with the manufacturer to correct the problem with the devices as quickly as possible and will continue to communicate as more information becomes available.” Beckman Coulter first notified its customers in August 2018 that they had identified a trend of erroneously elevated platelet results that were occurring without error messages, or alerts, which should alert the laboratory operator of the test about a potential problem. Based on additional information provided by the company to the FDA in April 2019, the agency asked Beckman Coulter to provide a second urgent medical device correction letter to customers, as well as send a letter with recommended actions to physicians likely to have patients affected by inaccurate results to ensure both doctors and pathologists are aware of the recall and understand steps that should be taken to ensure accurate and appropriate patient assessments are conducted. The FDA is communicating today to ensure hospitals, laboratories, health care professionals and patients have the appropriate information about the seriousness of the recall and recommended actions to take. The company has indicated to customers that a software update to the device may serve to alert laboratory personnel to any inaccurate results. However, the FDA has not evaluated the software and is working with the company to determine if the software update alone can adequately address the recall of this device. The agency recommends laboratory personnel use backup analyzers, if available, to confirm platelet results or perform manual platelet estimate/screening and follow the instructions in the Urgent Medical Device Correction letter dated May 20, 2019 before reporting platelet counts out of the laboratory. The FDA will continue to investigate this issue and work with the company to implement appropriate patient safety mitigations. The FDA encourages laboratories to contact any affected ordering physicians to discuss whether retesting of recently tested patients is appropriate. Health care providers who interpret these clinical results should discuss any concerns about the testing process with the clinical laboratory processing their samples and consider all available clinical information in their treatment decisions. The FDA is aware of more than 2,000 laboratories in the U.S. that may be affected, in locations such as large medical centers and small community hospitals. The agency is unable to determine how many patient samples may have been impacted and has not received reports of serious adverse events linked directly to the hematology analyzers. The FDA encourages health care professionals and laboratory personnel to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of Beckman Coulter products to the The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from Jeff Shuren, M.D., Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on continued efforts to assess duodenoscope contamination risk", "date": "April 12, 2019", "contents": " One of the touchstones of medical device safety lies in the authority of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to order manufacturers to conduct postmarket surveillance studies to address a new and significant health concern. Such studies yield important information that often lead to a broader understanding about a device’s risks and prompt the agency to issue new recommendations or policies to mitigate those risks. To that end, today, the FDA is reporting new information from postmarket surveillance studies on rates of contamination after the cleaning and reprocessing of certain duodenoscopes; these flexible lighted scopes are vital for minimally invasive procedures to diagnose and treat conditions of the pancreas and bile duct. For the past several years, the agency has undertaken an extensive and ongoing effort to prevent patient infections associated with the transmission of bacteria from contaminated duodenoscopes, including multi-drug resistant bacteria infections. These evaluating the effectiveness of current duodenoscope reprocessing instructions in health care settings and releasing voluntary standardized protocols for duodenoscope surveillance sampling and culturing. As a result, we’ve made strides in mitigating infections associated with reprocessed duodenoscopes and have seen a dramatic decline in reports of patient infections. But we’re continuing to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of these devices, and we’d like to see strong evidence that proper cleaning and reprocessing can virtually eliminate any bacteria residue that can spread infections. Currently, that evidence is lacking, and we’re considering what additional regulatory actions may be necessary. In 2015, the FDA the three U.S. duodenoscope manufacturers—Olympus, Fujifilm and Pentax—to conduct two postmarket surveillance studies to better understand the transmission of infections and assess the factors that contribute to their occurrence. Specifically, as part of their approved study plans, all three manufacturers are required to conduct a study to sample and culture reprocessed duodenoscopes that are in clinical use to learn more about issues that contribute to contamination, as well as a human factors study to assess whether trained hospital staff are following the reprocessing instructions. In December, the FDA issued a Safety Communication detailing the preliminary findings from these studies announcing a 3% contamination rate for “high concern” organisms. Today, we are providing a on these interim results from the sampling studies that show up to 5.4% of all properly collected samples tested positive for “high concern” organisms, which is significantly higher than the earlier results reported. “High concern” bacteria are more often associated with disease, such as E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, up to 3.6% of properly collected samples tested positive for low to moderate concern organisms; while these organisms don’t usually lead to dangerous infections, they are indicative of a reprocessing failure. When the sampling studies were designed, the FDA expected to see a total contamination rate for any type of organism of less than 1% or as close to zero as possible for duodenoscopes. Let me be clear, the percent of contaminated samples based on these interim results shows that improvements are necessary and we are committed to taking additional steps to reduce infections and contamination even further. The FDA previously instructed the manufacturers to conduct root cause analyses following the preliminary results announced last December to better understand these culturing results. These analyses are currently underway with an analysis of the newly collected samples, and final results are expected later in 2019. In the meantime, the FDA is exploring additional steps to take to reduce contamination rates. We have been consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal health partners to obtain their input and guidance on the issue of infection control and reprocessing of these difficult to clean scopes. Next month, the FDA plans to discuss this issue at the meeting to seek input on improving the safety of reprocessed devices. We are considering whether additional recommendations will be necessary to help health care facilities with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of duodenoscopes to lower contamination rates to less than 1%. For example, we are exploring whether supplemental measures, such as sterilization, in addition to meticulous cleaning, might offer a more effective option. This will take careful consideration because we know some sterilization methods could damage the duodenoscope over time and lead to a shorter lifespan for the expensive device. We will also be relying on the fulfillment of the duodenoscope manufacturers’ postmarket surveillance studies to provide additional crucial information that will help inform us as we determine whether additional steps need to be taken. This is especially critical in light of the concerns we’ve outlined to date with compliance in these studies. Last March, the FDA issued to all three duodenoscope manufacturers for failure to comply with their surveillance study commitments. While the firms have made some progress toward completing these studies, they are still not in compliance with the timetable they agreed upon to complete these studies. If the companies continue to fail to adequately respond to our concerns, the FDA will take additional action. Finally, we are working with manufacturers on new duodenoscope designs that could reduce the risk of contamination as well as disposable duodenoscopes that would avoid the need for reprocessing altogether. While the current contamination rates we’re seeing in the postmarket studies show the need for improvement, I want to emphasize that an individual patient’s risk of acquiring infection from an inadequately reprocessed medical device remains relatively low given the large number of such devices in use. It’s important to note that we’ve seen a decline in medical device reports associated with patient infections after the FDA implemented safety measures to improve reprocessing techniques, including issuing recommendations to health care providers to enhance their cleaning and high-level disinfection of these devices, working with duodenoscope manufacturers as they reviewed and modified their instructions for manual reprocessing and reviewing validated instructions for manufacturers of automated endoscope reprocessors that are used to reprocess duodenoscopes. A recent analysis of medical device reports submitted to the FDA indicates that the number of reports associated with patient infections peaked in 2015 at 250 reports and has declined by 62% to fewer than 100 reports per year in 2017 and 2018. Our recent actions have yielded improvements, but we also received reports of three deaths of U.S. patients in 2018 that were related to infections associated with duodenoscopes. That’s three deaths too many. Our efforts to reduce patient exposure to infections in health care settings remains an important public health goal, and the FDA understands the importance of keeping patients and health care providers updated and informed of the latest findings. We remain committed to our goal of reducing rates of contamination of these devices down to nearly zero and we will consider taking additional actions as needed to ensure that manufacturers meet their obligations to us on the postmarket surveillance studies. These actions are part of our larger efforts to enhance the safety of medical devices outlined in the . This plan aims to protect patients and spur innovation of new products that are safer, more effective, and address unmet medical needs.

{"title": "FDA approves first targeted therapy for metastatic bladder cancer", "date": "April 12, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted accelerated approval to Balversa (erdafitinib), a treatment for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer that has a type of susceptible genetic alteration known as FGFR3 or FGFR2, and that has progressed during or following prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients should be selected for therapy with Balversa using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic device. “We’re in an era of more personalized or precision medicine, and the ability to target cancer treatment to a patient’s specific genetic mutation or biomarker is becoming the standard, with advances being made in new disease types. Today’s approval represents the first personalized treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “FGFRs regulate important biological processes including cell growth and division during development and tissue repair. This drug works by targeting genetic alterations in FGFRs.” The most common type of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma, also called urothelial carcinoma. Bladder cancers are associated with genetic mutations that are present in the patient's bladder or entire urothelium (the lining of the lower urinary tract). Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. Fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) alterations are present in approximately one in five patients with recurrent and refractory bladder cancer. The efficacy of Balversa was studied in a clinical trial that included 87 patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, with FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations, that had progressed following treatment with chemotherapy. The overall response rate in these patients was 32.2%, with 2.3% having a complete response and almost 30% having a partial response. The response lasted for an average of approximately five-and-a-half months. About a quarter of patients in the study were previously treated with anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy, which is a standard treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Responses to Balversa were seen in patients who had previously not responded to anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy. Common side effects reported by patients taking Balversa were increased phosphate level, mouth sores, feeling tired, change in kidney function, diarrhea, dry mouth, nails separating from the bed or poor formation of the nail, change in liver function, low salt (sodium) levels, decreased appetite, change in sense of taste, low red blood cells (anemia), dry skin, dry eyes and hair loss. Other side effects include redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness on the hands or feet (hand foot syndrome), constipation, stomach pain, nausea and muscle pain. Balversa may cause serious eye problems, including inflamed eyes, inflamed cornea (front part of the eye) and disorders of the retina, an internal part of the eye. Patients are advised to have eye examinations intermittently and to tell their health care professional right away if they develop blurred vision, loss of vision or other visual changes. Health care professionals are advised to check patients’ blood phosphate level between 14 and 21 days after starting treatment and monthly, and to increase the dose Balversa in patients whose serum phosphate is below the target level. Health care professionals are advised to tell male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Balversa and for one month after the last dose. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Balversa. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Balversa because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Balversa must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Balversa received an , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to confirm Balversa’s clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies. Balversa was also granted designation. The FDA granted the approval of Balversa to Janssen Pharmaceutical.

{"title": "FDA requires stronger warnings about rare but serious incidents related to certain prescription insomnia medicines", "date": "April 30, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the agency is requiring a new boxed warning – the agency’s most prominent warning – on certain prescription insomnia drugs to better ensure patients and their health care professionals have the information they need when considering use of these medicines. The boxed warning follows several reports of rare, but serious injuries and deaths resulting from various complex sleep behaviors after taking these medicines. These complex sleep behaviors may include sleepwalking, sleep driving and engaging in other activities while not fully awake, such as unsafely using a stove. The new warnings will be required for eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, Intermezzo, and Zolpimist). “We recognize that millions of Americans suffer from insomnia and rely on these drugs to help them sleep better at night. While these incidents are rare, they are serious and it’s important that patients and health care professionals are aware of the risk. These incidents can occur after the first dose of these sleep medicines or after a longer period of treatment, and can occur in patients without any history of these behaviors and even at the lowest recommended doses,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Today’s action is an important step in our ongoing effort to call more attention to these critical safety issues and serves as an example of our ongoing commitment to ensuring that patients and health care professionals have the information they need to make informed treatment decisions.” In addition to the boxed warning, the agency is requiring the addition of a contraindication to not use these medicines in patients who have experienced an episode of complex sleep behaviors after taking them. The association between these drugs and complex sleep behaviors is already included in the label, which has been updated continually to note additional safety issues as they were identified. The boxed warning and contraindication are intended to make the warning more prominent and reflect the risk of serious injury and death. issued today, the FDA provides recommendations for health care professionals and patients and a summary of the data that led to these warnings. “We have closely watched the safety profile of these drugs since they were approved. When our ongoing safety monitoring recently reflected the risk of more serious injuries and deaths from patients on these medications who experienced complex sleep behaviors, we determined there was a need to take stronger steps to inform the public,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “We’ll continue to monitor and evaluate these risks associated with insomnia medications and communicate with the public or consider further actions, as appropriate.” As the result of a new safety review based on recent adverse event reports and other sources of data, the FDA has determined that while rare, complex sleep behaviors specifically associated with use of eszopiclone, zaleplon and zolpidem (not all sleep aids) have resulted in serious injuries and death. Specifically, the FDA reviewed 66 cases reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System or found in medical literature, in which patients engaged in activities while they were not fully awake, such as sleepwalking or driving, that resulted in serious injuries or death after taking insomnia medicines eszopiclone, zaleplon, or zolpidem. The 46 reports of non-fatal serious injuries included accidental overdoses, falls, burns, near-drowning, exposure to extreme cold temperatures leading to loss of limb or near death, self-injuries such as gunshot wounds and apparent suicide attempts. The 20 deaths reported were from carbon monoxide poisoning, drowning, fatal falls, hypothermia, fatal motor vehicle collisions with the patient driving and apparent suicide. As a requirement of their approval, insomnia medicines must be dispensed with a patient medication guide that explains the medicine’s uses and risks. Patients should review this information each time they receive a refill of their medicine as information may change. Health care professionals should not prescribe eszopiclone, zaleplon, or zolpidem to patients who have a history of complex sleep behavior after taking these insomnia medicines. Patients should be advised that rare, but serious injuries and death are possible. Patients should discontinue taking these medicines and contact their health care professional right away if they find themselves to have engaged in activities while not fully awake or if they do not remember activities done while taking the medicine.

{"title": "Statement from Jeff Shuren, M.D., director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on agency efforts to mitigate temporary shortage of pediatric breathing tubes due to recent closure of Illinois sterilization facility", "date": "April 12, 2019", "contents": " As part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to minimize impacts of medical product shortages, last month, the FDA the public of the potential for medical device shortages to arise from the closure of a large ethylene oxide sterilization facility in Willowbrook, Illinois, and the future planned closure of a similar facility in Michigan. Since the closure was announced, we have been taking steps to prevent patient harm from potential device shortages that could delay or disrupt critical care, including working to quickly and proactively secure alternative locations and methods for the sterilization of devices that were previously processed at the Willowbrook facility. We also committed to sharing updates on potential impacts to medical devices once sterilized at these facilities. Despite best efforts to minimize the impact of the closures wherever possible, we have identified a medical device that is now in temporary shortage. Today, we are alerting health care professionals, parents and caregivers that there is a temporary shortage of a type of a tracheostomy tube manufactured by Smiths Medical. I want to assure you that the FDA is working closely with the company to quickly resolve their sterilization challenges and bring these critical devices to the patients who need them as quickly as possible, which we anticipate will be made available again beginning the week of April 22. are used in health care facilities, such as hospitals, or at home to help adult and pediatric patients breathe. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a small opening that goes through the skin and tissue of the neck directly into the windpipe (trachea). The tracheostomy tube is placed through this opening, called a stoma, into the trachea to allow a patient to breathe through the tube instead of through their mouth or nose. Prior to initial use, Bivona tracheostomy tubes are sterilized with ethylene oxide before they are marketed in the U.S. After initial use, patients may reuse the tubes by reprocessing them as described in Bivona’s . Hospitals also may clean the tubes and sterilize them so they can be reused on the same patient. Although the Bivona tubes are indicated for use in both adult and pediatric patients, the temporary shortage is more likely to impact pediatric patients because supply of alternative tubes with similar functionality is limited. The Bivona tube is made from a flexible silicone material which makes them easier to insert in the stoma of pediatric patients. While there are other FDA-cleared silicone tracheostomy tubes for pediatric patients, there may not be enough available to adequately cover the shortage. We recognize the challenges this shortage imposes for these pediatric patients who need access to new tubes now, and are working to limit the impact to patients as much as possible by helping the company quickly move their sterilization to another facility. During the temporary shortage, health care professionals who have patients urgently in need of a new Bivona tube should contact Smiths Medical directly to inquire about current inventory. Parents and caregivers who need new Bivona tubes (e.g., due to damage or leaking of current tubes) should work with their health care professionals to find an appropriate alternative until the Bivona tracheostomy tube is back on the market. Adult patients experiencing problems obtaining Bivona tubes should talk with their health care professional about using other FDA-cleared tracheostomy tubes, including those made from different materials. The closure of the Willowbrook facility does not impact tubes already in use by patients at home or in health care settings. The company is communicating with patients about the tubes and how patients and caregivers can mitigate any potential impact, including re-using and cleaning tubes in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for use. The company is continuing to manufacture tracheostomy tubes per their normal schedule. The company has already started to use an alternative facility to sterilize their devices and estimates that approximately 28,000 new Bivona tracheostomy tubes are currently awaiting sterilization. We are working closely with Smiths Medical to expedite release of sterilized tubes that still meet the FDA’s standards for safety and effectiveness and expect new tubes to be available within the next few weeks. At this time, we are not aware of any other shortages due to these closures. As with the case of Smiths Medical, early awareness and engagement enables us to be proactive and develop a plan to mitigate effects on patient care. We continue to monitor the situation closely, including any submissions to the FDA and stand ready to act quickly with strategies intended to limit the impact of device supply interruptions on patients. We are continuing to update our web page to ensure patients, health care professionals and industry have the most up-to-date information. As we previously noted, we’re seeking to not only limit the immediate impact of these facility closures, but also to identify new and improved methods for medical device sterilization for which we will make additional announcements in the coming weeks. We recognize the very real consequences that medical device shortages have on patients, and we’ll continue to work directly with manufacturers, contract sterilizers, government agencies and other public health stakeholders to do all we can to avert new device shortages."},
{"title": "FDA Statement from Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response Frank Yiannas on new steps to protect consumers from unlawful ingredients in dietary supplements ", "date": "April 16, 2019", "contents": " Taking a dietary supplement – like vitamins, minerals, or herbs – has become a daily routine for many Americans. The $40 billion a year supplement industry reaches 170 million Americans, offering between 50,000 and 80,000 different products that claim to help maintain or improve health. For many, dietary supplements are a key part of their efforts to make healthy choices. To be able to make those choices with respect to dietary supplements, consumers need to have access to safe, well-manufactured, and appropriately labeled products. While many dietary supplements meet the FDA’s standards, there are some companies who knowingly distribute and sell dangerous or otherwise illegal products that put consumers at risk. As the agency entrusted with the oversight of dietary supplements, we will not stand by and allow these companies to compromise the health of the very people who are seeking out supplements to aid in their well-being. Earlier this year, we to strengthen the regulation of dietary supplements by modernizing our regulatory framework to meet the demands of this growing industry. Today, as part of those efforts, we are announcing an important new step and a new action to better protect consumers from potentially unlawful dietary supplements. The FDA is launching a new tool to quickly alert the public when we become aware of ingredients that appear to be unlawfully marketed in dietary supplements. This Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List will be housed on the . Consumers may wish to avoid buying and using dietary supplements containing ingredients on the List and industry may wish to avoid making or selling dietary supplements containing ingredients on the List. Ingredients will be added to the List following an initial FDA assessment indicating the ingredient may not lawfully be in dietary supplements. This could be for reasons including the ingredient does not fit the definition of a dietary ingredient or the ingredient requires a pre-market notification that was not submitted; however, inclusion of an ingredient on this List is not necessarily an indication of safety concerns. The FDA will continue to communicate separately and clearly any time we identify safety concerns about dietary ingredients or dietary supplements. As the dietary supplement marketplace has grown, the introduction of new ingredients often raises complex questions involving science, policy, and the law. In the time it takes the FDA to make a final determination, consumers and industry might mistakenly conclude that a lack of action by the FDA indicates that these ingredients are lawful. This List is intended to get information to both consumers and industry more quickly. It also provides an opportunity for stakeholders to share information with us that they think might be relevant to our determination. While we will aim to communicate about these suspect ingredients as quickly as possible, it is important to note that the List is not exhaustive; it will always be a work in progress. Additionally, we expect the List will evolve as new ingredients are identified and others are removed. Consumers can to receive the most recent updates and changes to the List, and all stakeholders can that may support or refute the FDA’s preliminary assessment regarding the ingredients on the List. The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List adds to our ability to inform and educate people in determining which ingredients might not be lawfully included in dietary supplements. We will continue to use our traditional enforcement tools as part of our overall strategy regarding dietary supplements. To that end, we continue to take action against those bad actors who seemingly ignore the legal requirements for dietary supplements. Today, we are also announcing that the agency has eight companies for marketing dietary supplements containing . These products are considered adulterated because the FDA has determined that DMHA is either a “new dietary ingredient” for which the FDA has not received the required New Dietary Ingredient notification or that DMHA is an unsafe food additive. The agency also issued warnings to three companies for marketing dietary supplements containing . These products are misbranded because they label phenibut as a dietary ingredient when phenibut does not meet the statutory definition of a dietary ingredient. The products identified in the warning letters include Lean Pills, Chaos Unleashed, Triple X Pre-Workout Stimulator, Simply Skinny Pollen, Synedrex, E.S.P. Extreme, Ultimate Orange, HydroxyElite, Lipodrene Elite, Synadrene, Enrage Extreme, Pre-Workout Relentless V1, Kavinace, Sleep Walker, Red Dawn Liquid, and Limitless. These companies have 15 business days from receipt of the warning letter to inform the FDA of specific steps they will take to bring their products into compliance with the law. This could include a company’s decision to recall, reformulate, discontinue sale or products, or other actions. We take these violations very seriously and stand ready to take enforcement action without further notice if the companies do not immediately cease distribution of the products. We are firmly committed to ensuring that products sold as dietary supplements meet the law’s requirements for dietary supplements, and most importantly, do not put consumers at unnecessary risk. Further, other companies marketing similar illegal products should take note—we will continue to take the necessary steps to protect the American public from ingredients that aren’t allowed in dietary supplements. Today’s actions are part of the FDA’s overall efforts to strengthen the agency’s regulation in a manner that strikes the right balance between preserving consumer access to lawful dietary supplements while also protecting Americans from the potential dangers of products that don’t meet the agency’s standards for dietary supplements. Just last week, we a public meeting to discuss responsible innovation in the dietary supplement industry. We’re excited to hear from all of our stakeholders in this arena and look forward to an in-depth conversation on May 16 to discuss ideas for facilitating responsible innovation in the dietary supplement industry while preserving the FDA’s ability to protect the public from unsafe, misbranded, or otherwise unlawful dietary supplements. We remain committed to advancing the important work of modernizing the FDA’s oversight of the dietary supplement industry and bringing greater assurance to Americans who rely on dietary supplements on a regular basis.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture", "date": "April 09, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of breaking a bone (fracture). These are women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies. More than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis, which is most common in women who have gone through menopause. People with osteoporosis have weakened bones that are more likely to fracture. “Today’s approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D, M.M.Sc., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. “But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it’s important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year.” Evenity is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the protein sclerostin and works mainly by increasing new bone formation. One dose of Evenity consists of two injections, one immediately following the other, given once a month by a health care professional. The bone forming effect of Evenity wanes after 12 doses so more than 12 doses should not be used. If osteoporosis therapy is needed after the 12 doses, patients should begin an osteoporosis treatment that reduces bone breakdown. The safety and efficacy of Evenity were demonstrated in two clinical trials involving a total of more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the first trial, one year of treatment with Evenity lowered the risk of a new fracture in the spine (vertebral fracture) by 73% compared to placebo. This benefit was maintained over the second year of the trial when Evenity was followed by one year of denosumab (another osteoporosis therapy) compared to placebo followed by denosumab. In the second trial, one year of treatment with Evenity followed by one year of alendronate (another osteoporosis therapy) reduced the risk of a new vertebral fracture by 50% compared to two years of alendronate alone. Evenity followed by alendronate also reduced the risk of fractures in other bones (nonvertebral fractures) compared to alendronate alone. Evenity increased the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in the alendronate trial, but not in the placebo trial. Therefore, Evenity contains a boxed warning on its labeling stating that it may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death and should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Health care professionals should also consider whether the benefits of Evenity outweigh its risks in those with other risk factors for heart disease and should discontinue Evenity in any patient who experiences a heart attack or stroke during treatment. Common side effects of Evenity included joint pain and headache. Injection site reactions were also observed. The FDA granted the approval of Evenity to Amgen.

{"title": "FDA approves first two-drug complete regimen for HIV-infected patients who have never received antiretroviral treatment", "date": "April 08, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Dovato (dolutegravir and lamivudine), as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults with no antiretroviral treatment history and with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Dovato. This is the first FDA-approved two-drug, fixed-dose, complete regimen for HIV-infected adults who have never received treatment for HIV. “Currently, the standard of care for patients who have never been treated is a three-drug regimen. With this approval, patients who have never been treated have the option of taking a two-drug regimen in a single tablet while eliminating additional toxicity and potential drug interactions from a third drug,” said Debra Birnkrant, M.D., Director of the Division of Antiviral Products. “Having a drug-sparing treatment available that uses fewer drugs is beneficial to patients who may have issues taking multiple medications over a long period of time.” Approximately 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV. About 15 percent of them (1 in 7) are unaware they are infected. Effective treatment is important in reducing the amount of virus in the blood. A suppressed viral load in people living with HIV prevents disease progression, and helps them live longer, healthier lives. Also, people living with HIV who take HIV medication daily as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partners. The Dovato labeling includes a Boxed Warning, which cautions that patients infected with both HIV and hepatitis B should add additional treatment for their hepatitis B or consider a different drug regimen. Patients with both HIV and hepatitis B who take products containing lamivudine, an ingredient in Dovato, have developed hepatitis B variants associated with resistance to lamivudine and may have severe liver problems, including liver failure, when they stop taking drugs containing lamivudine. Patients who have both HIV and hepatitis B virus who stop using Dovato should be closely monitored by their health care provider. The efficacy and safety of Dovato, one tablet taken daily, were demonstrated in two identical, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials in 1,433 HIV-infected adults with no prior antiretroviral treatment history. The trials showed that a drug regimen containing dolutegravir and lamivudine had a similar effect of reducing the amount of HIV in the blood compared to another drug regimen, which included dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. The treatment was considered successful if the patient maintained low-levels (less than 50 copies/mL) of HIV RNA in their blood for at least 48 weeks. The most common adverse reactions with Dovato were headache, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia and fatigue. As there is a known risk for neural tube defects with dolutegravir, patients are advised to avoid use of Dovato at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy. In May 2018, the FDA released a regarding reported neural tube birth defects in babies born to women treated with dolutegravir. In Feb. 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services announced a new initiative, , a once-in-a-generation opportunity to eliminate new HIV infections in our nation. This initiative will provide the hardest hit communities with the additional expertise, technology and resources required to address the HIV epidemic in their communities, focusing on certain geographic hotspots. The aim is to reduce new infections by 75 percent in the next five years and by 90 percent in the next ten years, averting more than 250,000 HIV infections in that span.

{"title": "Statement by Douglas Throckmorton, M.D., Deputy Center Director for Regulatory Programs in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, on new opioid analgesic labeling changes to give providers better information for how to properly taper patients who are physically dependent on opioids", "date": "April 09, 2019", "contents": " As the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) continues to make progress against the opioid crisis, the FDA remains focused on striking the right balance between reducing the rate of new addiction by decreasing excessive exposure to opioids through rational prescribing, while still enabling appropriate access to treatment for patients living with serious pain. We are also committed to making sure that patients who use opioids take them correctly, and if opioid treatment is no longer needed, that patients and their healthcare providers know how to discontinue the medication safely. Proper discontinuation of opioids is important because everyone who is treated with opioids for any length of time develops a physical dependence—meaning there are withdrawal symptoms if the treatment suddenly stops. However, being physically dependent is very different than being addicted. In contrast to physical dependence, addiction also involves behaviors, thoughts and feelings such as: a strong desire to take the drug; difficulties in controlling drug use; persisting in drug use despite harmful consequences; and a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations. Recently, the FDA has received reports of serious harm, including serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain and suicide, in patients who are physically dependent on opioid pain medicines when these medicines are suddenly discontinued or when the dose is reduced too quickly, often without adequate patient communication, follow-up or support. These practices have also been associated with patients attempting to find other sources of opioids in order to minimize their withdrawal symptoms or self-medicate for pain. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin and other substances. These may be signs of addiction (or opioid use disorder), but they may also be signs that a patient is physically dependent and has stopped opioid treatment too suddenly. There is an appropriate, evidence-based, safe way to taper opioids that can avoid severe side effects and minimize risks. Critically important, any taper must be tailored to the individual patient’s clinical and personal situation because of the many factors involved. Currently, FDA-approved labeling for opioid pain medications, as well as from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), describes the need to gradually reduce the dosage of an opioid medication over time, while monitoring carefully for signs of withdrawal. Yet, we know this is not always the way it’s handled in clinical practice. We need to do more to ensure that providers and patients have adequate guidance for safe opioid tapering. That’s why today we’re requiring changes to the prescribing information for all opioid analgesic medicines used in the outpatient setting and issuing a for health care providers and patients on this important issue. We’ll also engage with physician groups to walk through these updates, so they can provide the information to their members. These changes will provide expanded information to health care providers on how to safely decrease the dose in patients who are physically dependent on opioids. This information is intended to be used when the health care provider and the patient have determined together that a decrease in dose or discontinuation of the opioid is appropriate. When a health care provider and patient agree to taper the opioid, a variety of factors should be considered including: the dose of the drug, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. These labeling changes also emphasize the importance of having informed discussions between patient and clinician and ensuring follow-up and support for patients managing pain and changes to their medication regimens. There is no standard opioid tapering schedule suitable for all patients. Together, the health care provider and patient should agree on how to gradually reduce the dose of the opioid to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms, worsening of pain and psychological distress. Patients should be closely monitored during the opioid taper, and particularly for those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with higher doses for chronic pain, they should be offered a multimodal treatment approach including mental health support, as needed. If a substance use disorder is suspected, the patient should be assessed and treated using evidence-based strategies, such as medication-assisted treatment. We’re constantly monitoring the safety of opioid pain medicines, and we’re also updating the prescribing information to include new information on other side effects of opioid use including central sleep apnea and drug interaction; we’ve also updated information on proper storage and disposal of these medicines consistent with the information available on our At the FDA, we are continuing to aggressively confront the opioid crisis, while advancing policies to help make sure that patients with pain have access to appropriate, evidence-based care. We’re working with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to help advance the development of for appropriate opioid analgesic prescribing for acute pain resulting from specific conditions or procedures. The primary scope of this work is to understand what evidence is needed to ensure that clinical practice guidelines for opioid analgesic prescribing are sufficient and to identify what research is needed to generate that evidence in a practical and feasible manner. Soon, we’ll also advance policies to require that immediate-release formulations of opioids be made available in fixed-quantity packaging – such as blister packs – that contain doses (e.g., tablets) more typical of what patients may need for common acute pain conditions and procedures. Our data shows that many acute pain indications for which opioids are prescribed, such as post-surgical indications, require just one or two days of analgesic medicines. By having opioids packaged in fixed-quantity units (e.g., one or two days of pills), we believe providers will be more likely to write prescriptions for these short durations, and it will discourage the dispensing of 30 pill supplies, a prescribing practice that is still too common. The FDA remains committed to addressing the opioid crisis on all fronts, with a significant focus on decreasing unnecessary exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies and opioids more resistant to abuse and misuse; and taking action against those involved in the illegal importation and sale of opioids. The agency will also continue to evaluate how opioids currently on the market are used, in both medical and illicit settings, and take regulatory action where needed.

{"title": "FDA warns public not to use unapproved or uncleared medical devices to help assess or diagnose a concussion", "date": "April 10, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning the public not to use medical devices marketed to consumers that claim to help assess, diagnose or manage head injury, including concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or mild TBI. In a new , the FDA warned that such tools — such as apps on a smartphone marketed to coaches or parents for use during sporting events — have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety and efficacy and could result in an incorrect diagnosis, potentially leading to a person with a serious head injury returning to their normal activities instead of getting medical care. To date, there are a limited number of medical devices that have been by the FDA to aid in the diagnosis, treatment, or management of concussion, and all of them require an evaluation by a health care professional. “I want to be clear, there are currently no devices to aid in assessing concussion that should be used by consumers on their own. Using such devices can result in an incorrect diagnosis after a head injury that could lead a person with a serious injury to return to their normal activities instead of seeking critical medical care, putting them at greater danger,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Products being marketed for the assessment, diagnosis, or management of a head injury, including concussion, that have not been approved or cleared by the FDA are in violation of the law. The FDA routinely monitors the medical device market and became aware of violative products being marketed to consumers. The FDA has alerted companies to our concerns and asked them to remove such claims. We will continue to monitor the marketplace for devices making these unsubstantiated claims and are prepared to take further action if necessary.” In the safety communication issued today, the FDA explains that the products of concern include those that claim to assess and diagnose any changes in brain function by having an injured person perform tests on a smartphone or tablet-based app to determine a change in physical or mental (cognitive) status including vision, concentration, memory, balance and speech. The FDA’s recommendations for consumers, parents, caregivers and athletic coaches note that individuals should seek treatment right away from a health care professional if any head injury, including concussion, is suspected. The FDA will continue to monitor promotional materials and claims about uses of these and similar products and contact companies when we see violative practices. If the agency’s concerns are not addressed, the FDA will consider what additional actions, including potential enforcement actions, are appropriate.

{"title": "FDA issues final rule on safety and effectiveness of consumer hand sanitizers", "date": "April 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a designed to help ensure that hand sanitizers available over-the-counter (OTC) are safe and effective for those who rely on them. The rule establishes that certain active ingredients are not allowed to be used in OTC hand sanitizers, formally known as topical consumer antiseptic rub products, which are intended for use without water, that are marketed under the FDA’s OTC Drug Review. The final rule also seeks to ensure that the agency’s safety and effectiveness evaluations and determinations for consumer antiseptic rub active ingredients are consistent, up-to-date and appropriately reflect current scientific knowledge and increasing use patterns. “Our action today aims to help provide consumers with confidence that the over-the-counter hand sanitizers they’re using are safe and effective when they don’t have access to water to wash with soap,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “In today’s final regulation we finalized the FDA’s previous determination that 28 active ingredients, including triclosan and benzethonium chloride, are not eligible for evaluation under the FDA’s OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic rubs. We’ve also reaffirmed our need for more data on three other active ingredients, including ethyl alcohol, which is the most commonly used ingredient in hand sanitizers, to help the agency ensure that these products are safe and effective for regular use by consumers. We believe industry has made good progress toward providing data and we will continue to provide updates to the public about the progress of collecting this data.” Consumer antiseptic hand sanitizers provide a convenient alternative when hand washing with plain soap and water is unavailable. Millions of Americans use antiseptic rubs daily, sometimes multiple times a day, to help reduce bacteria on their hands. advises that washing hands with plain soap and running water is one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading infections to others. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. As part of the June 30, 2016 , the FDA requested additional scientific data to support the safety and effectiveness of active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic rubs. At this time, three active ingredients—benzalkonium chloride, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol—are being deferred from further rulemaking to allow for the ongoing study and submission of additional safety and effectiveness data necessary to make a determination regarding whether these active ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effective for use in OTC consumer antiseptic rub products. Their status will be addressed either after completion and analysis of the studies or at another time, if these studies are not completed. At this time, the FDA does not intend to take action to remove hand sanitizers containing these three active ingredients from the market. Less than 3% of the marketplace will be affected by the issuance of this final rule, as most OTC consumer antiseptic rubs use ethyl alcohol as the active ingredient. The FDA is aware that retailers and pharmacies continue to market a very low number of consumer hand sanitizers containing benzethonium chloride, but that they stopped marketing hand sanitizers containing triclosan. Drug products containing any ineligible active ingredients will require approval under a new drug application or abbreviated new drug application prior to marketing. This final rule completes a series of rulemaking actions in the FDA’s ongoing review of OTC antiseptic active ingredients to determine whether these ingredients are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA previously issued final rules on (Sept. 2016) and (Dec. 2017)."},
{"title": "FDA orders important safety labeling changes for Addyi", "date": "April 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a to Sprout Pharmaceuticals for their drug, Addyi (flibanserin), that requires the company to revise important safety information that women and their health care professionals need to have when considering use of the drug. The changes are the result of the FDA’s review of postmarketing studies, including one required of Sprout when Addyi was approved in to treat acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women, as well as other data. “The FDA helps ensure that the most current safety information about the use of prescription drugs is accurately reflected in product labeling, giving health care professionals and patients confidence that they are able to make the most informed treatment decisions,” said Julie Beitz, M.D. director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Office of New Drugs. “We recognize that women want access to treatments for female sexual dysfunction, and we are committed to helping ensure approved therapies are safe and effective when taken as indicated and to supporting the development of new therapeutic options for female sexual dysfunction.” At the time of approval, the FDA reviewed data that included several concerning cases of severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and syncope (passing out) when Addyi and alcohol were taken together. As a result, Addyi’s labeling currently includes a boxed warning (the strongest warning the FDA requires), which states that alcohol must be avoided in women treated with Addyi. The FDA also required a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which requires that health care professionals who prescribe Addyi and pharmacies that dispense Addyi, must be certified with the and that patients must be counseled about the risk of hypotension and syncope. In addition, the FDA required Sprout to further study the interaction between Addyi and alcohol after approval. Based on the results of postmarketing studies, the FDA has determined that changes must be made to Addyi’s labeling to clarify that there is still a concern about consuming alcohol close in time to taking Addyi but that it does not have to be avoided completely. Specifically, the boxed warning, contraindication, warnings and precautions, and adverse reactions sections of labeling are being updated to reflect that women should discontinue drinking alcohol at least two hours before taking Addyi at bedtime or to skip the Addyi dose that evening. Women should not consume alcohol at least until the morning after taking Addyi at bedtime. The FDA is ordering a safety labeling change requiring Sprout to make these changes because the agency was not able to reach an agreement with the company, which was continuing to request removal of the boxed warning and contraindication about alcohol completely from the product labeling. The FDA determined, based on a careful review of available data, that removing this important safety information was not acceptable for the protection of public health. “We work diligently with companies to make labeling updates but occasionally are unable to reach agreement. In those rare cases, such as with Addyi today, we have important authorities to compel companies to make safety labeling changes that are critical for the safe use of an approved product. We are taking this action because it is our responsibility to help protect the safety of those who take prescription medicines, which includes helping to ensure that patients are provided access to the most up-to-date information about the drugs they take,” continued Dr. Beitz. The FDA’s decision to order modifications to the warnings about Addyi and alcohol, instead of removing the boxed warning and contraindication completely, is based on two sets of postmarket research studies. In the FDA-required postmarketing trial in women who took Addyi and drank alcohol at the same time, there were missing or delayed measurements for blood pressure from when the women were first laying down to when they stood up that are critical in determining the risk of hypotension and syncope when taking Addyi and alcohol together. The FDA’s specific concerns with the trial included: The pattern of the missing or delayed measurements provides further evidence of an interaction between Addyi and alcohol that can increase the risk of hypotension and syncope. Given these results, the FDA has determined that the boxed warning and contraindication continue to be warranted. Women at home will not have the safety measures that were included in this trial or necessarily have access to immediate assistance if they were to experience severe hypotension or syncope, which can lead to serious outcomes including falls, accidents and bodily harm. In other postmarketing trials, results showed that the risk of severe hypotension and syncope was reduced when women who consumed up to two alcoholic drinks waited at least two hours before taking Addyi. The FDA has found these results sufficient to support a modification to the boxed warning and contraindication stating that Addyi and alcohol must not be taken close in time (i.e. not within two hours). Addyi is a serotonin 1A receptor agonist and a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist, but the mechanism by which the drug improves sexual desire and related distress is not known. Addyi is taken once daily. It is dosed at bedtime to help decrease the risk of adverse events occurring due to possible hypotension, syncope and central nervous system depression (such as sleepiness and sedation). Patients should discontinue treatment after eight weeks if they do not report an improvement in sexual desire and associated distress. The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of Addyi are dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dry mouth. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require and, when necessary, order safety labeling changes to reflect new safety information about an approved prescription drug. Failure to respond to the order as outlined may result in monetary fines and additional enforcement actions including seizure of the product and injunction. Sprout has until April 16, 2019, to appeal the order through the FDA’s formal dispute resolution process. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. While there were no reports of syncope or hypotension needing intervention amongst women in the trial, the safety precautions built into this trial did not allow for an adequate assessment of this risk. For example, women with low blood pressure while lying down or with symptoms that could be related to low blood pressure (such as dizziness) were not permitted to stand up to have blood pressure measurements taken or had to have repeated blood pressure measurements while lying down until they were high enough for the women to safely stand up. As a result, the data collected had missing or delayed blood pressure measurements from these women while standing. Many more women had missing or delayed blood pressure measurements when they took Addyi and alcohol together compared to when they received alcohol alone or Addyi alone. The amount of missing blood pressure measurements peaked around the time when Addyi’s blood levels were highest in those taking Addyi with alcohol."},

Mavyret was previously approved to treat HCV in adults in “Direct-acting antiviral drugs reduce the amount of HCV in the body by preventing the virus from multiplying, and in most cases, they cure HCV infection,” said Jeffrey Murray, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval represents another treatment option for children and adolescents with HCV infection, but for the first time, in all genotypes of HCV.” HCV is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people in the U.S. have chronic HCV, and children born to HCV-positive mothers are at risk for HCV infection. It is estimated that there are 23,000 to 46,000 children in the U.S. with HCV infection. With today’s approval, dosing information is provided for Mavyret for the treatment of adult or pediatric patients 12 years and older, or weighing at least 99 pounds, who are infected with any of six identified HCV genotypes either without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. The safety and efficacy of Mavyret in pediatric patients was evaluated during clinical trials of 47 patients with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 HCV infection without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis. Results of the trials demonstrated that 100 percent of patients who received Mavyret for eight or 16 weeks had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting that patients’ infection had been cured. In pediatric patients with cirrhosis, history of a kidney and/or liver transplant, or genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection, the safety and efficacy of Mavyret are supported by previous studies observed in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in adults. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Mavyret in adults. Treatment duration with Mavyret differs depending on treatment history, viral genotype and cirrhosis status. The most common adverse reactions in patients taking Mavyret were headache and fatigue. Mavyret is not recommended in patients with moderate cirrhosis and contraindicated in patients with severe cirrhosis. It is also contraindicated in patients taking the drugs atazanavir and rifampin. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected adult patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. HBV reactivation in patients treated with direct-acting antiviral medicines can result in serious liver problems or death in some patients. Health care professionals should screen all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before starting treatment with Mavyret. The FDA granted the approval of Mavyret to AbbVie Inc.

The FDA has placed stringent marketing restrictions on the products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. Following a rigorous science-based review through the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway, the agency determined that authorizing these products for the U.S. market is appropriate for the protection of the public health because, among several key considerations, the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes. The products authorized for sale include the IQOS device, Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks. While today’s action permits the tobacco products to be sold in the U.S., it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA approved.” All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive and those who do not use tobacco products should continue not to. Additionally, today’s action is not a decision on the separate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications that the company also to market them with claims of reduced exposure or reduced risk. “Ensuring new tobacco products undergo a robust premarket evaluation by the FDA is a critical part of our mission to protect the public, particularly youth, and to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. While the authorization of new tobacco products doesn’t mean they are safe, the review process makes certain that the marketing of the products is appropriate for the protection of the public health, taking into account the risks and benefits to the population as a whole. This includes how the products may impact youth use of nicotine and tobacco, and the potential for the products to completely move adult smokers away from use of combustible cigarettes,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “Importantly, the FDA is putting in place postmarket requirements aimed at, among other things, monitoring market dynamics such as potential youth uptake. We’ll be keeping a close watch on the marketplace, including how the company is marketing these products, and will take action as necessary to ensure the continued sale of these products in the U.S. remains appropriate and make certain that the company complies with the agency’s marketing restrictions to prevent youth access and exposure. As other manufacturers seek to market new tobacco products, the FDA remains committed to upholding the vital public health standards under the law and using all the tools at our disposal to ensure the efficient and appropriate oversight of tobacco products.” , manufacturers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. Importantly this includes youth. The agency’s evaluation includes reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives and health risks, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and labeled. The review for the IQOS products took into account the increased or decreased likelihood that existing tobacco product users will stop using tobacco products, and the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using them. In particular, through the FDA’s scientific evaluation of the company’s applications, peer-reviewed published literature and other sources, the agency found that the aerosol produced by the IQOS Tobacco Heating System contains fewer toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, and many of the toxins identified are present at lower levels than in cigarette smoke. For example, the carbon monoxide exposure from IQOS aerosol is comparable to environmental exposure, and levels of acrolein and formaldehyde are 89% to 95% and 66% to 91% lower than from combustible cigarettes, respectively. Additionally, IQOS delivers nicotine in levels close to combustible cigarettes suggesting a likelihood that IQOS users may be able to completely transition away from combustible cigarettes and use IQOS exclusively. Available data, while limited, also indicate that few non-tobacco users would be likely to choose to start using IQOS, including youth. While these non-combusted cigarettes may be referred to as “heat-not-burn” or “heated” tobacco products, they meet the definition of a cigarette in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Therefore, these products must adhere to existing restrictions for cigarettes under FDA regulations, as well as other federal laws that, among other things, prohibit television and radio advertising. In addition, to further limit youth access to the products and exposure to their advertising and promotion, the FDA is placing stringent restrictions on how the products are marketed – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including requirements that advertising be targeted to adults. The company must also give notification to the FDA of, among other things, its labeling, advertising, marketing plans, including information about specific adult target audiences, and how it plans to restrict youth access and limit youth exposure to the products’ labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion. The agency has issued a providing its rationale for these postmarket requirements, which highlight important considerations for reviewing the company’s applications as well any potential future PMTAs for other products. The FDA also is requiring all package labels and advertisements for these products to include a warning about the addictiveness of nicotine, in addition to other warnings required for cigarettes, to prevent consumer misperceptions about the relative addiction risk of using IQOS compared to combusted cigarettes. With the authorization of these products, the FDA will evaluate new available data regarding the products through postmarketing records and reports required in the marketing order. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. The FDA may withdraw a marketing order if it, among other reasons, determines that the continued marketing of a product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health, such as if there is an uptake of the product by youth. The FDA is continuing its substantive scientific review of the company’s MRTP applications. The company would need to receive an MRTP order from the FDA before they could market a tobacco product with any implicit or explicit claims that, among other things, a product reduces exposure to certain chemicals or that use of the product is less harmful than another tobacco product or would reduce the risk of disease. If a company markets a tobacco product as an MRTP without authorization, the company would be in violation of the law and may face FDA advisory or enforcement actions."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D., and Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health on FDA’s new efforts to protect women’s health and help to ensure the safety of breast implants", "date": "May 02, 2019", "contents": " There has been a growing discussion in recent months around the safety of certain breast implants, with regulatory agencies around the world weighing the risk of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). It’s an issue that has been a priority for us at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2011 when we warned women that the available information at the time indicated that there is a risk for women with breast implants, especially those with textured implants, for developing this disease. Since that time, we have worked diligently to fill the gaps in knowledge, such as evaluating the body of available evidence regarding the safety and risks of breast implants, including concerns specific to textured implants and the risk of BIA-ALCL. The agency has undertaken several steps to better understand this issue, including an in-depth review of post-approval study data, medical device reports, scientific literature and breast implant-specific registries, and public discussions. But this is not the only issue we’ve been considering with respect to breast implants. The agency has regularly communicated about additional , such as capsular contracture and implant rupture. And we have heard from patients concerned that their implants may be connected to health conditions involving their immune system’s response to these devices, resulting in a variety of symptoms like chronic fatigue, cognitive issues, joint and muscle pain. While the FDA doesn’t have definitive evidence demonstrating breast implants cause these symptoms, the current evidence supports that some women experience systemic symptoms that may resolve when their breast implants are removed, referred to by some patients and health care professionals as breast implant illness. We believe women considering a breast implant should be aware of these risks. As we describe below, we are taking steps to better characterize the condition and its risk factors, and are considering ways to help to ensure women have all of the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to obtain breast implants or to remove existing breast implants in an effort to reverse systemic symptoms. Most recently, we discussed these important issues in a . In the pursuit of our mission to protect the public health, one of the most important things we do as regulators is to listen to the experiences and perspectives of patients, medical and scientific experts and other stakeholders related to medical products. The meeting covered a range of important topics on breast implant safety, including the use of surgical mesh in breast implant surgery, characterization of BIA-ALCL incidence and risk factors, and methods for assessing systemic symptoms. During the two-day meeting, we listened carefully to the insightful comments and personal stories from a broad range of public, scientific, medical and other stakeholders. These insights have been invaluable in growing our understanding of the potential risks associated with breast implants and the need for further efforts to help to ensure appropriate patient protections and improve breast implant safety. To that end, the information we’ve garnered, from this meeting and other ongoing efforts, makes clear there is an opportunity to do more to protect women considering breast implants. And today, we are announcing several new steps we have taken and are considering aimed at helping to ensure that women have access to the information they need about breast implants to make informed decisions and to further drive evidence generation that will help the FDA make the most appropriate scientific regulatory decisions moving forward. First, we will take steps to improve the information available to women and health care professionals about the risks of breast implants that would include addressing the risk of BIA-ALCL, the greater risk of BIA-ALCL with textured implants, and the risk of developing systemic symptoms that would contribute to the patient-provider discussion about breast implants. We are also looking at ways to incorporate product ingredient information into the labeling in a way that is easy for patients to understand. The FDA would work with stakeholders, including patient groups, on the content and format of any labeling changes proposed or recommended by the FDA, which could include a boxed warning and a patient decision checklist, and would work with manufacturers on implementing any changes to the information they provide to health care professionals and patients, including labeling. We are considering these actions to help to ensure that all women who consider breast implants have the information they need to have thoughtful and balanced discussions with their health care professional about both the benefits and risks of breast implants based on clear information reflecting the most current understanding of these issues. As we undertake this effort, we recognize that there is a need to help to ensure that information reaches health care professionals and women. We are aware that there are some health care professionals, such as gynecologists, dermatologists, internists and pathologists, who may not be fully aware of these breast implant risks, like BIA-ALCL and systemic symptoms. We are committed to doing what we can to reach them with this important information, including continuing the outreach we started with our to educate the medical community about BIA-ALCL and other risks of breast implants. We also plan to work with the pathology community to educate pathologists about testing for this lymphoma specific to breast implants. In addition, we’re committed to continuing to update the public about any new information related to breast implant risks, as well as updating and improving the communication tools we have for women on our website. We will continue our regular updates about the known global medical device reports for , as we have done since 2011. Moving forward, we plan to also regularly communicate information we receive through medical device reports about systemic symptoms experienced by patients with breast implants. We provided information at the two-day advisory committee meeting on medical device reports we’ve received that mention systemic symptoms described by some as breast implant illness, and we plan to continue sharing the numbers of medical device reports on these symptoms. We are also announcing today a change in how breast implant manufacturers file medical device reports with the FDA. We appreciate the value to the public in ensuring this information from medical device reports is readily available to them. In an effort to promote greater public transparency, the FDA has ended all summary reporting of breast implant medical device reports and has notified breast implant manufacturers of this decision. This is part of a larger effort to end the alternative summary reporting program for all medical devices, which we intend to complete in the coming weeks. This program was established in 1997 to more efficiently review adverse events for well-established risks but was not allowed for patient deaths and unusual, unique or uncommon adverse events, which, in the case of breast implants, included BIA-ALCL. Alternative summary reports were not previously available in our public database for medical device reports, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience ( Moving forward, breast implant manufacturers will be required to file individual medical device reports that will be publicly available in MAUDE. For past data received through summary reporting, the agency will also be making this data, including , publicly available in the coming weeks. We believe these steps for more transparent medical device reports will contribute to greater public awareness of breast implant adverse events. Increased public awareness of the number of adverse events may contribute to a woman’s own understanding of the risks of breast implants, but, as with any medical device report, it’s important to note that generally the number of reports received cannot be used to determine the frequency with which a particular adverse event occurs. The information in medical device reports is important, but they are only one tool that contributes to our understanding of breast implants. Further, it is important that people understand that the reports are just that – a report by an outside party. The agency has not verified that they are accurate, nor that the issue was in fact caused by the device. For this reason, among others, these reports cannot be used alone to determine an incidence rate, causation or associations as many reports can be duplicative or incomplete. Partnering with registries, such as the Patient Registry and Outcomes for Breast Implants and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) Etiology and Epidemiology ( ), which collects real world data on patients with BIA-ALCL diagnoses, and the new National Breast Implant Registry ( ), which collects real world data on the safety and performance of breast implants, is one way in which we seek to gain greater insight and more comprehensive information about women’s experiences with breast implants. We expect that both breast implant registries will greatly contribute to helping us evaluate data from providers regarding their patients with breast implants. The data already made available to us from the PROFILE registry provides additional information about patients diagnosed with BIA-ALCL. However, more needs to be done to increase the number of health care professionals contributing to the registries and types of information collected by the registries. The FDA continues to encourage stakeholders that have organized these registries to take steps to expand provider participation; request additional information from providers, such as the patient’s family history of autoimmune disorders and details of past operations; and seek ways to make the data collected more public and transparent, so that patients and researchers can access and analyze the information. We believe this work with the registries, along with our efforts to in how the post-approval studies are conducted, will help improve the evidence generated on breast implants and can greatly contribute to our understanding and further assessment of BIA-ALCL, systemic symptoms and other potential long-term risks from breast implants. Better evidence generation leads to more robust and scientifically-sound regulatory decisions. A few of our international counterparts have started to initiate actions to ban or restrict sales of some textured breast implants, based on concerns about BIA-ALCL. In those markets, there are textured implants that are not marketed in the U.S. and where the use of textured implants is much higher, sometimes as high as 80% market share. In 2018, textured breast implants represented less than 10% of breast implants sold in the U.S. The type of macro-textured implants targeted by some of our international counterparts represents less than 5% of breast implants sold here. At this time, the FDA does not believe that, on the basis of all available data and information, the device meets the banning standard set forth in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA believes regulatory action must be based on scientific data. While the majority of women who develop BIA-ALCL have had textured implants, there are known cases in women with smooth-surface breast implants and many reports do not include the surface texture of the implant at the time of diagnosis. We are focused on strengthening the evidence generated to help inform future regulatory actions and to assure that women and providers are adequately informed of the risk of BIA-ALCL, including that the risk is higher with the use of textured implants, albeit still low. We are still investigating the cause of the association and we will continue to monitor, assess and report our findings as we continue to strengthen our evidence collected so that women and providers can be better informed about BIA-ALCL as they consider breast implants. Taken together, we believe these efforts to improve communication and focus on evidence generation will contribute significantly to improving the safety of breast implants and want to share that many of these efforts are already underway. We are committed to making a difference for women’s health and will continue working towards ensuring we understand the benefits and risks of these devices, and that women have the most complete information available to make important breast implant decisions.

{"title": "FDA Statement on the agency’s list of known nitrosamine-free valsartan and ARB class medicines, as part of agency’s ongoing efforts to resolve ongoing safety issue ", "date": "April 04, 2019", "contents": " of impurities found in drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, we’ve been working to thoroughly understand how this issue arose, how we could address and mitigate exposure to this unnecessary risk to patients, and what we could do to prevent these types of impurities from reoccurring in future medications. We know that the discovery of these genotoxic impurities, called nitrosamines, is alarming to patients who expect their products to be free from these types of impurities. And while we’ve concluded through our risk assessments that the maximum possible exposure to nitrosamines (which are also known environmental contaminants and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products and vegetables) in ARB medicines appears to be small, their presence in drug products is not acceptable. Our response to this issue has been comprehensive and constant – an internal working group led by a multidisciplinary team of chemists, toxicologists, physicians, pharmacists, communication specialists, investigators and analytical laboratory staff from across the FDA and in collaboration with global regulators. We’ve remained steadfast in making sure we minimize risks to patients who rely on these medications, ensure access to safe ARBs or acceptable alternative therapies, and ensure affected medications are removed from the U.S. supply chain. Although we still have more work to do, we’re making significant advances in our efforts to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to these impurities. Today, for the first time since the first nitrosamine impurity was discovered last summer, we’re announcing that we so far have identified , with the expectation that this number will increase. Our goal is for this information to help health care providers as they consider acceptable treatment options for their patients. Our assessment takes into consideration testing for impurities conducted by the FDA’s laboratories, an evaluation of the manufacturing process used by multiple manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) found in ARB medicines, as well as other information available to the agency from manufacturers and international regulators. We’ll continue to update this list of nitrosamine-free ARBs as we become aware of additional information and as we progress in our assessments of other ARB medications. We’re also continuing to work with manufacturers to swiftly remove medications from the market if they contain a nitrosamine impurity at levels higher than the . Removing the affected medications from the market has led to shortages, and since then we’ve been working to mitigate and prevent shortages as often as possible. Currently, valsartan products are in shortage, and we know that other types of products have the potential to fall into shortage soon. In anticipation, the agency is not objecting to temporary distribution of specific lots of losartan that contain impurities above the interim acceptable intake limit, for a short period of time. After careful evaluation of safety data and consideration of the benefits and risks to patients, we think it’s critical that patients have access to these drugs while impurity-free losartan is manufactured. Our scientists feel that this will not have a meaningful increased risk for cancer over the time it should take to get impurity-free losartan to market. The agency expects many companies will be able to manufacture losartan without nitrosamine impurities and replenish the U.S. supply in approximately six months. We want to reassure patients that we strongly believe the risks, such as stroke, of abruptly discontinuing these important medicines far outweighs the low risk associated with continuing the medications with these impurities. In addition to the 40 medications listed above, the list also includes other products on the market that remain under evaluation. For these ARBs, although our overall determination is still pending, at this time nitrosamine impurities either have not been detected or are below the interim acceptable intake limits, and the medications can still be distributed. We’ll keep working with manufacturers to eliminate these impurities from the drug supply, but we recognize that we also need to ensure patients who need ARBs have access now. We’re also providing an update regarding steps we have taken to engage drug product and API manufacturers to address nitrosamine impurities in their medications. We recently sent manufacturers and applicants a to inform them about factors that can contribute to the formation of nitrosamine impurities during manufacturing (which we understand may be generated when specific chemicals and reaction conditions are present in the manufacturing process of the drug’s API) and to reiterate steps they should take to ensure these impurities are not present in any ARB in the future. In addition to these risks, our letter emphasizes the possibility of contaminated raw materials, including and especially solvents and catalysts (particularly when these are reused). Manufacturers should determine whether the raw materials they use to make drugs were recycled, meaning previously used, even if it is not disclosed by their supplier. We also urge manufacturers to be vigilant and ensure that materials they receive from their suppliers are free of nitrosamines, including when they consider new suppliers. Patients should continue taking their medicine until their pharmacist provides a replacement or their doctor provides an alternative treatment option --even if they learn that their ARB medicine is recalled. The risk associated with abruptly discontinuing the use of these important medicines far outweighs the low risk that our scientists estimate to be associated with continuing the medicine until the patient’s doctor or pharmacist provides a safe replacement or a different treatment option. We’re closely monitoring the supply of ARBs and will communicate any drug shortages promptly to the public. Today’s news, of the certainty and broad number of nitrosamine-free ARB medicines, is another positive step. Health care practitioners should familiarize themselves with alternative medicines that can be used to treat hypertension, heart failure or renal disease in case of shortages. Despite the very low risks associated with the use of affected ARBs, we fully recognize that these medications can be made without nitrosamine impurities and are working with manufacturers to reach that goal. We’ll continue to prioritize our investigation into this ongoing issue, and we’ll provide additional updates to consumers, health care providers and industry on our investigation and assessments to ensure patient safety. We’ll continue to improve our science and standards for detecting and preventing the development of genotoxic impurities during the drug manufacturing process, and this will remain an area of intense focus in the months ahead.

Through this joint effort, each agency will work toward enhancing knowledge-transfer to increase efficiency, reduce duplication of efforts and facilitate mission responsibilities. Collaboration on shared laboratory space, scientific equipment and facilities, along with intellectual, historical and institutional knowledge will optimize the resources at each agency’s disposal. “Today’s letter of intent demonstrates the FDA’s ongoing work with CBP and our other federal partners, to ensure that FDA-regulated products imported into the U.S. are safe and otherwise comply with federal law,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Thousands of illicit and dangerous products come from overseas each day, such as unapproved fentanyl products, counterfeit prescription drugs or fake over-the-counter products that look legitimate. In recent years, we’ve committed new resources and have been granted new authorities by Congress to target these violative products and stop them before they’re able to enter our country. When bad actors try to circumvent the safety of our supply chains by breaking federal law, we’ll take all appropriate action necessary to ensure these potential risks do not harm the American public.” “CBP and FDA have a long history of working jointly to protect the public from illegal or harmful products entering the U.S.,” said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan. “Information and resource sharing between agencies allows us to be more effective and more efficient in confronting threats. We are eager to see the results of this expanded partnership. I would also like to congratulate FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb for his accomplishments during his tenure and thank him for strengthening the CBP and FDA collaboration. We look forward to continuing these efforts with our colleagues at the FDA.” Most mail arrives in an IMF without advanced or specific identifying information. The FDA uses to assess the contents of these packages and to increase efficiency of the agency’s overall investigational capabilities. The FDA and CBP will expand how information is shared between the agencies to identify trends which can target future entries. This may include general data points on frequent countries of origin, as well as specific products and volumes of packages at each location. An additional focus of this effort will be coordinating shared space as well as increased scientific presence at high-risk/high-volume IMF locations, helping to facilitate and support real-time entry decisions and increased data sharing. Additionally, the FDA and CBP will enhance coordination around efforts to identify violative packages and develop new targeting and enforcement strategies at Ports of Entry. In Fiscal Year 2018, FDA staff posted at the IMFs around the country examined packages from more than 180 countries. Approximately 90 percent of the packages reviewed by the FDA contained products that should not have been entering the country. There are currently nine locations across the U.S., with one location in Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands respectively and two locations in California.

{"title": "FDA issues warning letter to genomics lab for illegally marketing genetic test that claims to predict patients’ responses to specific medications", "date": "April 04, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to Inova Genomics Laboratory (Inova) of Falls Church, Virginia, for illegally marketing certain genetic tests that have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety and effectiveness. The tests claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications based on genetic variants. Selecting or changing drug treatment in response to the test results could lead to potentially serious health consequences for patients. The FDA is unaware of any data establishing that Inova’s tests can help patients or health care providers make appropriate treatment decisions for the listed drugs. The action today reflects the agency’s commitment to monitor the pharmacogenetic test landscape and take action when appropriate to address a significant public health risk. “Consumers are increasingly embracing genetic testing to better understand their individual risk for developing diseases. With this rise in popularity and availability, we’re also seeing significant activity in the field of pharmacogenetics, which is the process of understanding what, if any, role genetics plays in a patient’s reaction to particular drugs. Without appropriate evaluation to determine whether these tests work, patients are being put at risk—potentially impacting treatment decisions by providing false promise that they will respond well to a certain medicine or keeping them from using therapies that may benefit them,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We are issuing this warning letter as part of our ongoing efforts to protect the public from the significant risk these tests pose. We are particularly concerned about pharmacogenetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications where such claims have not been established and are not described in the drug labeling and continue to warn patients and health care professionals that they should not rely on these tests for treatment decisions.” “To be able to detect genetic variants and use them in determining an appropriate course of care is one way in which we encourage research and innovation. We have so much more to learn about the use of these tests for specific medications, what the results mean, and how we can apply the information to improve a patient’s health,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “While we are committed to supporting innovation in this area, we will also be vigilant in protecting against the potential risks and are therefore issuing this warning letter to help protect patients and providers from acting on data that has not been demonstrated to promote the safe and effective use of drugs.” The use of some drugs can be informed by pharmacogenetic testing. When the agency has reviewed scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between the drug’s effects and genetic variants and determined the information is sufficient to be included in the drug labeling, information about how to use the genetic test results to manage medication treatment is described in the labeling for the specific drug to assure safe use of the drug. The FDA issued a warning letter to Inova for marketing pharmacogenetic tests that have not been reviewed by the FDA and that claim to predict patients’ clinical responses to specific named drugs, including antidepressants, opioids, cancer treatments, anesthesia and diabetes medications. The FDA has not reviewed and is unaware of any data establishing that Inova’s tests can help patients or health care providers use the listed drugs more safely or effectively. The warning letter requests that Inova respond, within 15 working days from the date the warning letter was received, with details of how the violations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Any violations not corrected could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction or civil money penalties. Tests that make claims that have not been evaluated by the FDA may influence health care providers and patients to inappropriately select or change drug treatment based on the results from genetic tests.  Acting on these results could lead to potentially serious health consequences for patients. For example, patients may change the dose of their medication for a particular condition or disease based on the results of such a genetic test, which may lead to an incorrect treatment or worsening illness. Last year, the agency a safety communication warning consumers and health care professionals about pharmacogenetic tests being marketed directly to consumers or offered through health care providers that claim to predict how a patient will respond to specific medications. Following issuance of the safety communication, the FDA reached out to several firms marketing pharmacogenetic tests with claims to predict how a person will respond to specific medications in cases where the relationship between genetic (DNA) variations and the medication's effects has not been established. Most firms addressed the FDA’s concerns by removing specific medication names from their labeling, including promotional material and patient test reports. These actions, including the warning letter issued today, reflect the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of device safety. As part of the , the FDA has warned the public when safety issues are identified, such as with Health care professionals and consumers should report any adverse events related to these and other genetic tests to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting program.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on continued efforts to advance safe biotechnology innovations, and the deactivation of an import alert on genetically engineered salmon", "date": "April 08, 2019", "contents": " Advancements in the dynamic field of biotechnology are bringing about the development of innovative, new food products. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we’re committed to helping food developers bring biotechnology innovations to market while at the same time providing consumers with confidence that foods available for purchase in the U.S. – whether developed using traditional breeding techniques or biotechnology – meet the FDA’s high safety standards. Biotechnology is a term used to describe certain methods, including genetic engineering (GE), that scientists use to introduce new, favorable traits or characteristics to an organism. Part of our work implementing the FDA’s vital mission is focused on evaluating the safety of intentional genomic alterations (IGAs) in animals that will ultimately be sold for consumption to American consumers. We recently advanced a comprehensive framework for the efficient development of safe biotechnology products with our new . In recent years, we’ve taken important steps to help advance novel products, including our 2015 decision to approve an , a GE Atlantic salmon that contains the first approved IGA in an animal intended for food use. Today, we are taking another important step by deactivating a 2016 import alert that prevented GE salmon from entering the U.S. The FDA’s approval of the application related to AquAdvantage Salmon followed a comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence, which determined that the GE Atlantic salmon met the statutory requirements for safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, in 2016, Congress directed the FDA not to allow into commerce any food that contains GE salmon until it issued final labeling guidelines for informing consumers of the GE salmon content in the food. The FDA complied with this requirement by implementing an import alert in 2016 that prevented GE salmon from entering the U.S. With Congress’ enactment of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was charged with implementing a mandatory standard for disclosing whether a food is “bioengineered” and FDA was divested of its authority over voluntary labeling to indicate the presence of GE content in human foods. The FDA no longer has the authority to issue labeling guidance on this topic; however, the FDA believes this Congressional mandate has been satisfied by the USDA’s issuance of final regulations implementing that law in late 2018 because the law and regulations require that human food containing GE salmon bear labeling indicating that it is bioengineered. Therefore, the FDA is deactivating the import alert that prevented food from AquAdvantage Salmon, including salmon eggs used to grow the fish, from entering the U.S. With the deactivation of the import alert, AquAdvantage Salmon eggs can now be imported to the company’s in Indiana to be raised into salmon for food. As was determined during the FDA’s 2015 review, this fish is safe to eat, the genetic construct added to the fish’s genome is safe for the animal, and the manufacturer’s claim that it reaches a growth marker important to the aquaculture industry more rapidly than its non-GE farm-raised Atlantic salmon counterpart is confirmed. Additionally, as part of its approval, the FDA also analyzed the potential environmental impact that an approval of the AquAdvantage Salmon application would have on the U.S. environment and published its in November 2015. Based on the multiple forms of physical and biological environmental containment measures proposed by the company in its application, the FDA found that an approval of the application related to AquAdvantage Salmon would not cause a significant impact on the U.S. environment. Subsequently, the FDA found that multiple forms of containment proposed in the to raise the salmon in the company’s Indiana facility also would have no significant impact on the environment. The FDA’s approval process for IGAs in animals is risk-based and includes an assessment of . The FDA encourages developers of IGAs in animals to approach the agency early in their research and development phase to discuss the specific risk profile of the proposed product and the regulatory pathway for commercialization. The FDA routinely works with sponsors early and often to provide greater clarity in the regulatory process, encourage development and research, and support an efficient and predictable pathway to approval. The FDA is committed to supporting innovation and ensuring safety in the biotechnology space, including the use of IGAs in animals. We’re interested in the promise that newer technologies can have for bringing innovative products, such as these, to market while also helping to ensure they are safe and effective. Our recently issued focuses on advancing policy priorities the FDA will pursue to clarify our science-and-risk-based approach for product developers, avoiding unnecessary barriers to future innovation in plant and animal biotechnology, and advancing safety and our public health mission. We’ll continue collaborating with industry as part of our comprehensive work supporting safe and effective biotechnology innovations moving forward. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "FDA warns about risks of using home use test strips that are pre-owned or not authorized for sale in U.S., including those for glucose, warfarin ", "date": "April 08, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned against using test strips from a previous owner (pre-owned) or test strips not authorized for sale in the U.S. because they may potentially cause infection or lead to inaccurate test results, which can cause serious harm, including death. The FDA issued a alerting patients and health care professionals about the risks of using these kinds of test strips. “Millions of Americans use test strips at home to monitor serious diseases or conditions. We recognize that some people may be choosing to purchase pre-owned or unauthorized test strips because they believe there is a cost savings. However, by doing so they may be putting themselves at risk for serious injury or even death,” said Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s warning is part of our ongoing public health commitment to communicate when we become aware of issues stemming from the use, or misuse, of medical devices. In alerting the public and helping them to recognize the illegal sale of these products, we hope to prevent unnecessary harm to people who rely on testing.” Test strips are part of many that allow people to test for or monitor some diseases or health conditions at home. For example, a person with diabetes may apply blood to a test strip to measure their blood glucose (sugar) level or people on warfarin therapy may apply blood to a test strip to obtain their International Normalized Ratio (INR), a measurement used to monitor individuals on warfarin therapy to determine whether or not they are in their therapeutic range. The FDA is aware that some sellers are marketing test strips previously owned by another user or test strips that are not authorized for sale in the U.S. to consumers. These test strips may be sold through online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist, or directly from a seller. While the FDA is not aware of any deaths or serious injuries specifically associated with pre-owned warfarin INR or glucose test strips or test strips not authorized for sale in the U.S., the agency is warning consumers about the potential for significant injury from using pre-owned or unauthorized products. These test strips may not be safe to use because they may be expired or may have been stored improperly, which could lead to inaccurate results if used. If a user receives an inaccurate result from a test strip and uses this result as a basis for their treatment, they could take too much medication or not enough medication, potentially leading to serious injury, including death. It’s also possible the test strips may have small amounts of blood from the previous owner on them, which can put users at risk of infection from potential cross-contamination. To determine whether or not a test strip is pre-owned or unauthorized, the FDA recommends inspecting the package to check whether it has been opened or altered and to check expiration dates. If someone is able to purchase prescription-only test strips without a prescription, the products may be unauthorized for sale in the U.S. and should not be used. Test strips should only be purchased from a trusted source, such as a local pharmacy or through the test strip manufacturer. Patients who are unsure about where to buy safe test strips or cannot afford to buy unused test strips should talk with their health care provider or pharmacist. There may be patient assistance programs through test strip manufacturers or consumer advocacy organizations that help provide financial assistance to people who cannot afford to buy test strips. Some test strip manufacturers also offer coupons or prescription cards that may help reduce the cost. As part of the FDA’s , the FDA is committed to alerting the public when safety issues are identified, such as . The agency is also working with stakeholders to develop patient registries, including the , to provide more complete evidence in clinical areas to enhance the agency’s ability to identify and act upon safety issues with medical devices. As part of this critical work, we remain dedicated to closely monitoring reports of adverse events associated with the use of test strips. We will keep the public informed if new information becomes available. We encourage patients, providers and health care facilities to report adverse events to , the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D., on FDA’s ongoing scientific investigation of potential safety issue related to seizures reported following e-cigarette use, particularly in youth and young adults", "date": "April 03, 2019", "contents": " Over the last nearly two years, we’ve spoken often about both the opportunity for e-cigarettes to be an off-ramp for currently addicted adult smokers to completely switch to a potentially less harmful form of nicotine delivery, as well as the tremendous concern for – and series of actions we’re taking to forcefully confront – the recent epidemic level rises of youth e-cigarette use that’s threatening the commitment we’ve made to reduce tobacco use among our nation’s children. We know that nicotine isn’t a harmless substance, especially in the developing brains of our youth. We know that initiation to, and addiction to, nicotine by never-smokers – predominantly youth and young adults – raises public health concerns. These risks are among the many reasons why we so strongly believe that no child should be using any tobacco product. But we’ve also been clear that, even for adults, e-cigarettes are not risk free. While we believe that currently addicted adult smokers who completely switch off of combustible tobacco and onto e-cigarettes have the potential to improve their health, e-cigarettes still pose health risks. These include the possible release of some chemicals at higher levels than conventional cigarettes. We’ve also seen data that indicate there may be other potential health concerns. We recognize that in many areas, more information is needed to assess whether there are additional consequences to nicotine use, especially from the use of e-cigarettes, some of which deliver high concentrations of nicotine. We’re working to collect that information. This includes looking at existing research, adverse event reporting, and both funding and conducting studies that will help fill the current gaps in information. Among the efforts underway, we recently announced that we’re looking at the potential for direct effects of harm from e-cigarettes on the lungs as well as other health factors that these products could negatively impact. In particular, we have concerns about the direct effects of e-cigarettes on the airways. This includes the potential for the use of such products to cause changes to airways that could be a precursor to cancer. We currently have animal toxicology studies underway to further evaluate signals we’ve seen that identify these risks. Today, we’re of another potential emerging safety issue of which the FDA has recently become aware. We have reports indicating that some people who use e-cigarettes, especially youth and young adults, are experiencing seizures following their use. Seizures or convulsions are known potential side effects of nicotine poisoning and have been reported in scientific literature in relation to intentional or accidental swallowing of nicotine-containing e-liquids. However, an FDA review of voluntary adverse event reports for these products submitted to the agency and to poison control centers has identified a total of 35 reported cases of seizures following use of e-cigarettes between 2010 and early 2019. While 35 cases may not seem like much compared to the total number of people using e-cigarettes, we are nonetheless concerned by these reported cases. We also recognize that not all of the cases may be reported. We believe these 35 cases warrant scientific investigation into whether there is in fact a connection. We want to be clear that we don’t yet know if there’s a direct relationship between the use of e-cigarettes and a risk of seizure. We can’t yet say for certain that e-cigarettes are causing these seizures. We’re sharing this early information with the public because as a public health agency, it’s our job to communicate about potential safety concerns associated with the products we regulate that are under scientific investigation by the agency. This also helps encourage the public to voluntarily report additional adverse events that can better inform our work. Unfortunately, in this case, many of the reports received to date lack enough information to identify a specific brand or sub-brand of e-cigarette. The reports also don’t provide enough detail to establish a clear pattern or cause for these incidents. For example, seizures have been reported among first-time e-cigarette users and experienced users. In a few situations, e-cigarette users reported a prior history of seizure diagnosis. A few reported cases indicated that the seizures occurred in association with the use of other substances such as marijuana or amphetamines. Seizures have been reported as occurring after a few puffs or up to one day after use. There are many factors that may lead to seizures. For example, e-liquids have varying levels of nicotine concentrations, and some e-cigarette design features may allow a user to obtain high levels of nicotine quickly. E-cigarette use behaviors also vary and users may deliberately or inadvertently inhale more nicotine than would typically occur. Additionally, some of the reported incidents may not be directly related to e-cigarettes use – the seizures may have been triggered by an underlying medical condition, use of other substances, or other factors. At the same time, due to the voluntary nature of these case reports, we must also recognize that there may be more instances of seizure in e-cigarette users than have been reported. We are actively seeking additional reporting. We’re encouraging health care professionals, consumers, parents, teachers and other concerned adults, as well as youth and young adult users to be aware of this potential health issue and report any past or future incidents of seizures following e-cigarette use to the FDA. Additional reports or information about these incidents may help us determine if there’s a connection and help identify common risk factors and if any e-cigarette product attributes, such as nicotine content or formulation, may contribute to seizures. We’re asking that any unexpected health or product issues experienced with e-cigarettes or any tobacco product be reported to the FDA through our . Information about the specific product used (including brand name), whether it was modified in any way or if other tobacco products, medications, supplements or other substances were used, as well as details about product use preceding the adverse event, are critical pieces of information to help fully assess this issue more broadly. We need more information before we can determine if there’s in fact a link between e-cigarette use and the reported incidents. It’s our hope that these public steps to solicit additional reports of adverse events, along with other agency efforts, will allow us to understand whether there’s a connection. While we continue our scientific investigation, we’ll also continue our work to more fully understand other potential risks associated with e-cigarette use. We take our public health mandate seriously. The FDA is committed to monitoring this issue closely and taking additional steps as necessary to protect the public, especially our nation’s youth, from the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. We will continue to provide updates as more is learned.

{"title": "Statement by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Biologics Center Director Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D. on FDA’s continued efforts to stop stem cell clinics and manufacturers from marketing unapproved products that put patients at risk", "date": "April 03, 2019", "contents": " Stem cell therapies offer the potential to treat or even cure diseases or conditions for which few effective treatment options exist. Cell based therapies are one of the most promising new fields of science and medicine. These products hold tremendous potential for transformative and potentially curative treatments for some of the most devastating diseases and conditions challenging us today. For several decades now, stem cells obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood have had an established role in providing valuable treatment for patients with certain cancers, like leukemia, and certain other serious diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. But most forms of regenerative medicine are still in early stages of development and adult stem cells and stem cells from birthing tissues have not yet been shown to be safe and effective for use in the treatment of any other diseases or conditions. Legitimate and well-intentioned investigators and firms are doing the essential groundwork to develop such products, fully in keeping with our statutes and regulations, examining their safety and potential benefits in a range of diseases and conditions, including cancers, heart failure, stroke and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). But some actors are leveraging the widespread belief in the eventual promise of these products, flouting the statutes and our regulations, and deceiving patients by illegally manufacturing or selling purported therapies, and falsely promoting their benefits. This ultimately puts at risk the very patients they claim to want to help. It’s important to recognize up front that there is a well-founded and longstanding rationale, established in statute and regulation, why certain stem cell therapies are subject to careful development requirements under the FDA’s existing regulations. There’s a false premise being asserted by some in the field that a product derived from a person’s own body and then manipulated and reinserted for another use different from the one it played in its original location is not subject to FDA regulation just because it originated from the person it was given back to. But stem cell products can create unique and serious risks depending on how they’re manipulated once they’re taken from the body and how they are used once they’re reinserted in the body. When a product undergoes more than minimal manipulation, its characteristics may be changed in a way that are novel, and its risks and potential benefits unique. We’ve seen too many cases of sponsors claiming that cells aren’t subject to FDA regulation just because the cells originated from the same patient to whom the eventual manufactured product is being given. And we’ve seen too many cases of companies making unsubstantiated claims that these treatments prevent, treat, cure or mitigate disease where the products have sometimes led to serious patient harm. Patient safety is our first priority. These violative actions create a direct risk to patients. They also create indirect risks by potentially encouraging them to forgo otherwise effective, available treatments, and opt instead for purported treatments that create risks and offer no demonstrated benefits. These kinds of false claims and violative activities also do a tremendous disservice to innovators who are working to legitimately develop safe and effective stem cell therapies by casting doubt across the entire field. We’re now nearly halfway through the period during which the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain regenerative medicine products with respect to the FDA’s investigational new drug application (IND) and premarket approval requirements when the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns, which we first announced in our November 2017 for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products. We’ve seen modest progress by the industry in coming into compliance, but much more work needs to be done. There’s no room for companies that place patients at risk through products that violate the statutes and our regulations, including by not having in place an IND or biologics license. As we come up on the end of this period during which the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, we may take additional steps to delineate an efficient development path for promising products that pose lower risk to patients and that are being developed by sponsors who’ve engaged the regulatory process in a responsible manner by filing INDs. These would be cases where the sponsors have undertaken or are in the process of undertaking well-designed investigational studies with the intent of collecting information to more clearly identify the safety and benefits of their products. But for sponsors whose stem cell products are regulated as drugs, devices, and/or biological products under the statutes and existing regulations, where the products create more significant potential risks because of the way that they’re manipulated or delivered, and who haven’t engaged the regulatory process to properly develop these products, we’ll step up our oversight. Over the past year, we have sent 45 manufacturers and health care providers regulatory correspondence, including warning letters, and we have . We’re committed to taking appropriate steps to address those that jeopardize the health of the people we are sworn to protect. Today, we’re continuing these efforts. The agency issued a to Cord for Life, Inc., located in Altamonte Springs, Florida, for manufacturing unapproved umbilical cord blood products in violation of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, including failing to validate processes to prevent bacterial contamination, raising potential significant safety concerns that put patients at risk. In addition, we issued 20 letters today to separate manufacturers and health care providers across the country who may be offering unapproved stem cell products, reiterating the FDA’s compliance and enforcement policy. We remain very concerned that countless clinics across the country continue to market violative stem cell products to patients, claiming that they don’t fall under the regulatory provisions for drugs and biologics. This is simply not true. The FDA has had final regulations in place for these products for well over a decade. We intend to take steps to help make sure that products are produced and marketed in compliance with statutes and our regulations. We’ll continue to conduct inspections, as appropriate, to help ensure such compliance. And we will not shy away from taking further steps when we see bad actors taking advantage of patients, and putting them at serious risk, for their own financial profit. Our work to ensure compliance with the law and to protect patients does not take away from our firm commitment to advance an efficient path for the safe and effective development of novel regenerative medicine products and to help foster beneficial new innovations. We’ll continue work closely with investigators and firms legitimately working in this field to do so in the most effective manner possible, while meeting the FDA’s standards for safety and efficacy as is expected with all drug and biological products. Over the past year, the FDA has used a variety of tools to support such development, including providing advice through CBER’s meeting process and through use of expedited programs, such as , for those products that qualify. We acknowledge the challenges that product development can present for smaller entities such as academic institutions and group practices. With the goal of helping to facilitate the development of stem cell products, and to help small groups of collaborating investigators, the FDA continues to encourage sponsors to discuss novel clinical development approaches with the agency, such as the collaborative development model highlighted in our guidance . In addition, during the next year, the agency will explore whether there are additional ways that it can assist legitimate developers of stem cell products to come into compliance with its regulations. We remain committed to supporting patients’ access to safe and effective stem cell therapies, by ensuring that the process is as efficient as possible under applicable FDA regulations governing product investigation, manufacturing and approval. Although it’s our hope that product developers will voluntarily come into compliance with our regulations, it’s also our responsibility to take appropriate steps to address those unlawfully manufacturing or distributing products. This is especially true when it comes to products that may pose a significant risk to patients, including because of the way the products are being manipulated or used. Stem cell therapies hold significant potential to improve human health. However, that potential will never be realized if careful scientific work and thoughtful clinical investigation supporting the safety and efficacy of these products for intended uses outside of hematologic and immunologic reconstitution are not conducted. The FDA is committed to helping advance the safe and effective development of novel stem cell therapies. We look forward to working with those who share our goal of bringing safe and effective products to market to benefit individuals in need. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. on steps toward a new, tailored review framework for artificial intelligence-based medical devices ", "date": "April 02, 2019", "contents": " Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to fundamentally transform the delivery of health care. As technology and science advance, we can expect to see earlier disease detection, more accurate diagnosis, more targeted therapies and significant improvements in personalized medicine. The ability of artificial intelligence and machine learning software to learn from real-world feedback and improve its performance is spurring innovation and leading to the development of novel medical devices. Today, we’re announcing steps to consider a new regulatory framework specifically tailored to promote the development of safe and effective medical devices that use advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Artificial intelligence algorithms are software that can learn from and act on data. These types of algorithms are already being used to aid in screening for diseases and to provide treatment recommendations. Last year, the FDA authorized an artificial intelligence based device , an eye disease that can cause vision loss. The agency also authorized a second artificial intelligence based device The authorization of these technologies was a harbinger of progress that the FDA expects to see as more medical devices incorporate advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to improve their performance and safety. Artificial intelligence has helped transform industries like finance and manufacturing, and I’m confident that these technologies will have a profound and positive impact on health care. I can envision a world where, one day, artificial intelligence can help detect and treat challenging health problems, for example by recognizing the signs of disease well in advance of what we can do today. These tools can provide more time for intervention, identifying effective therapies and ultimately saving lives. We’re taking the first step toward developing a novel and tailored approach to help developers bring artificial intelligence devices to market by . Other steps in the future will include issuing draft guidance that will be informed by the input we receive. Our approach will focus on the continually-evolving nature of these promising technologies. We plan to apply our current authorities in new ways to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation and ensure the safety of these devices. The artificial intelligence technologies granted marketing authorization and cleared by the agency so far are generally called “locked” algorithms that don’t continually adapt or learn every time the algorithm is used. These locked algorithms are modified by the manufacturer at intervals, which includes “training” of the algorithm using new data, followed by manual verification and validation of the updated algorithm. But there’s a great deal of promise beyond locked algorithms that’s ripe for application in the health care space, and which requires careful oversight to ensure the benefits of these advanced technologies outweigh the risks to patients. These machine learning algorithms that continually evolve, often called “adaptive” or “continuously learning” algorithms, don’t need manual modification to incorporate learning or updates. Adaptive algorithms can learn from new user data presented to the algorithm through real-world use. For example, an algorithm that detects breast cancer lesions on mammograms could learn to improve the confidence with which it identifies lesions as cancerous or may learn to identify specific subtypes of breast cancer by continually learning from real-world use and feedback. We are exploring a framework that would allow for modifications to algorithms to be made from real-world learning and adaptation, while still ensuring safety and effectiveness of the software as a medical device is maintained. A new approach to these technologies would address the need for the algorithms to learn and adapt when used in the real world. It would be a more tailored fit than our existing regulatory paradigm for software as a medical device. For traditional software as a medical device, when modifications are made that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, a sponsor must make a submission demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the modifications. With artificial intelligence, because the device evolves based on what it learns while it’s in real world use, we’re working to develop an appropriate framework that allows the software to evolve in ways to improve its performance while ensuring that changes meet our gold standard for safety and effectiveness throughout the product’s lifecycle—from premarket design throughout the device’s use on the market. Our ideas are the foundational first step to developing a total product lifecycle approach to regulating these algorithms that use real-world data to adapt and improve. We’re considering how an approach that enables the evaluation and monitoring of a software product from its premarket development to post-market performance could provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and allow the FDA’s regulatory oversight to embrace the iterative nature of these artificial intelligence products while ensuring that our standards for safety and effectiveness are maintained. This first step in developing our approach outlines information specific to devices that include artificial intelligence algorithms that make real-world modifications that the agency might require for premarket review. They include the algorithm’s performance, the manufacturer’s plan for modifications and the ability of the manufacturer to manage and control risks of the modifications. The agency may also intend to review what’s referred to as software’s predetermined change control plan. The predetermined change control plan would provide detailed information to the agency about the types of anticipated modifications based on the algorithm’s re-training and update strategy, and the associated methodology being used to implement those changes in a controlled manner that manages risks to patients. Consistent with our existing quality systems regulation, the agency expects software developers to have an established quality system that is geared towards developing, delivering and maintaining high-quality products throughout the lifecycle that conforms to the agency’s standards and regulations. The goal of the framework is to assure that ongoing algorithm changes follow pre-specified performance objectives and change control plans, use a validation process that ensures improvements to the performance, safety and effectiveness of the artificial intelligence software, and includes real-world monitoring of performance once the device is on the market to ensure safety and effectiveness are maintained. We’re exploring this approach because we believe that it will enable beneficial and innovative artificial intelligence software to come to market while still ensuring the device’s benefits continue to outweigh it risks. We have more work to do to build out this initial set of ideas and we’ll rely on comments and feedback from experts and stakeholders in this space to help inform the agency as we continue to think about how we’ll regulate artificial intelligence technologies to improve patient care. We anticipate several more steps in the future, including issuing draft guidance that’ll be informed by the feedback on today’s discussion paper. As with all of our efforts in digital health, collaboration will be key to developing this appropriate framework. We encourage feedback and welcome a diversity of opinions and thoughtful discourse, which will contribute to building the foundation of this regulatory paradigm. As algorithms evolve, the FDA must also modernize our approach to regulating these products. We must ensure that we can continue to provide a gold standard of safety and effectiveness. We believe that guidance from the agency will help advance the development of these innovative products. We’ve taken similar steps to advance other novel oversight frameworks for new technologies. Our Digital Health Innovation Action Plan laid the groundwork for new approaches to foster innovation in digital health. We’re building our Digital Health Center of Excellence to develop more efficient ways to ensure the safety and effectiveness of technologies like smart watches with medical apps. Our Software Precertification Pilot Program is allowing us to test a new approach for product review. While I know there are more steps to take in our regulation of artificial intelligence algorithms, the first step taken today will help promote ideas on the development of safe, beneficial and innovative medical products."},
{"title": "FDA takes new steps to increase access to adverse event report data for medical products used in animals", "date": "April 03, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it is making available online the adverse event reports related to animal drugs and medical devices used in animals. The reports will go back 30 years. They will be available electronically on , an agency-run digital platform used by researchers, statisticians and other academics to access large, valuable public health datasets collected by the FDA. This action is part of a broader effort by the agency to increase the transparency and sharing of adverse event report data related to the medical products that the FDA regulates. “The FDA has made it a priority to enhance transparency and information sharing across our entire portfolio of regulated products, especially when the availability of such information can benefit human and animal health. This action to make available adverse event reports related to drugs and medical devices used in animals is the latest step in our ongoing effort to provide greater access to data from adverse event reports across our entire portfolio, including human drugs and medical devices,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The reports being added today to openFDA can be valuable to all those involved in animal care by helping animal health providers identify and prevent potential harms. This is data we use every day at the FDA to identify potential safety concerns that weren’t known at the time of approval. By providing greater access to this important information, we hope stakeholders will be able to leverage the data to expand the body of knowledge related to the safety of medical products intended for animals.” The information made available on openFDA comes from the , one of the post-market surveillance tools that the FDA uses to monitor the animal and human user safety of drugs and medical devices used in animals, as well as the effectiveness of these products. This detailed level of data was previously only available via a Freedom of Information Act request. As a result of the action the agency is announcing today, it is available electronically to the public and accessible for automated searching on openFDA.gov. Information about adverse events reported by veterinarians, animal caretakers and pet owners is also included. Making adverse event data public and accessible is part of the FDA’s overall commitment to transparency and its goal of enabling the availability of open data for the benefit of public health and safety. The availability of adverse event report data on animal drugs and medical devices used in animals in openFDA follows other agency efforts related to ensuring public access to safety-related information. For example, in 2017, the FDA that improves access to data on adverse events associated with drug and biologic products in its database called FAERS (FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System). These improvements enable users to search for and organize data by criteria such as drug/biological product, age of the patient, type of adverse event, year the adverse event occurred, or within a specific timeframe. Also that year, the FDA modified the conditions of one of its adverse event reporting programs for human medical devices, called alternative summary reports (ASR), to begin making the summaries available in its existing public facing medical device reporting database known as MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). To further advance transparency, the FDA stated last week that it is developing ways to make ASR data received prior to 2017 more easily accessible by users. Manufacturers of FDA-approved animal drugs are required to report adverse events associated with their products to the agency. Pet owners and animal producers, as well as both animal and human health care providers, may elect to voluntarily report to the FDA adverse events involving approved and unapproved drugs, as well as medical devices used in animals. This first posting of data to be made publicly available on openFDA.gov includes approximately 865,075 adverse event reports submitted between Jan. 1, 1987 to April 3, 2019. The reports are associated with approved animal drugs, unapproved/compounded drugs and medical devices used in animals. The FDA will upload new data received via the CVM AER system to openFDA.gov on a quarterly basis, which will also include voluntary reports from a variety of sources, including pet owners, animal producers, veterinarians and other health care providers. “It cannot be stressed enough how important detailed adverse event reports are in helping the FDA identify and investigate potential concerns about the safety or effectiveness of drugs or medical devices used in animals, as well as their potential impact on the safety of people administering these products,” said Steven M. Solomon, M.P.H., D.V.M., director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. “While we recognize that this data is valuable to the research community, healthcare providers and beyond, it is also important to note that it is just one of many datasets that helps inform the agency of possible problems associated with a product and there are important limitations to the data.” The FDA uses CVM AER data as one way to monitor the safety of drugs and medical devices used in animals by identifying trends and potential safety issues. The agency’s review and analysis of data from these reports can help to identify possible safety and efficacy concerns and add to our body of knowledge about the product or category of products. Review of this data can also lead to safety alerts or label changes, and in some cases, additional regulatory and enforcement actions.

{"title": "Remarks from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., as prepared for testimony before a U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations on FDA’s Fiscal Year 2020 budget", "date": "March 28, 2019", "contents": " Good morning Chairman Hoeven, Ranking Member Merkley, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget request for the FDA. This is the last time I’ll appear before this subcommittee in my current role, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with you. I am proud of what we accomplished together, to advance the public health mission of the FDA over the past two years, and I am thankful for your willingness to support us in moments of challenge and opportunity. We’re especially grateful for the funding increases the subcommittee provided for FDA in Fiscal Year 2019. The 2019 Budget includes one of the most substantial increases for the FDA in recent years. The new funding will help the agency modernize our approach to medical product manufacturing and ensure the quality of compounded drugs. You’ve provided key support for us to advance competition through generic drugs, and to use real world evidence to improve our understanding of the benefits and risks of drugs and devices, across the product lifecycle. We appreciate your support for our efforts to keep pace with rapidly evolving digital health technologies, modernize our information technology systems, and protect the safety of the nation’s food supply. I’m personally grateful for the opportunity to engage with all of you directly, and with your staff, in advancing these and many other important goals. The funding requested in the President’s FY 2020 Budget will allow the agency to advance our work to ensure the safety of the food and medical products consumers use every day. We’re also seeking new funds to promote competition to bring better and more affordable products to market, support the development of innovative medical products to bring new cures to patients, further modernize our food safety system, strengthen our response capabilities when there’s an outbreak of foodborne illness, and continue to implement the 21st Century Cures Act. Today I want to focus on one of my highest priorities since taking my role two years ago – the FDA’s work to combat the opioid crisis. This is the biggest public health crisis facing the agency, and remains one of the biggest crises facing our nation. The contours of this crisis are changing from a crisis that was formed largely in the medical setting, often through prescription drugs that were prescribed lawfully but far too loosely; to a crisis that increasingly involves the use of illicit drugs like super-potent fentanyls. But the fact remains that we still need to take more steps to rationalize prescribing, and too many prescriptions are still being written, and they’re being prescribed for durations of use that are too long for the underlying indication. At the FDA, we’re continuing to take new and aggressive steps to combat this crisis. Even as we see some encouraging trends as prescribing declines, we can’t lose our focus. We’re very far away from fully addressing this crisis. It was a crisis formed over many years, and through many missteps or missed opportunities. To reverse these trends, we need a comprehensive approach. This crisis will remain our highest priority for many years to come. The 2020 Budget requests $55 million to continue supporting the four main areas of the agency’s work. These funds will continue to build on the significant financial investments this subcommittee has provided to the agency for our opioids work over the last two fiscal years. We’re focused on decreasing exposure and preventing new addiction, supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder, promoting development of novel pain treatment therapies, and increasing enforcement and carefully assessing benefit-risk of opioids. We’re also fighting this crisis by implementing the important new authorities that FDA sought and Congress provided in the SUPPORT Act. We’ve already implemented some of these new authorities, and will implement others very soon, including a requirement that some opioid manufacturers provide unit-of-use packaging for the immediate release (IR) formulations of these drugs. I believe if these IR drugs like Vicodin and Percocet were available in one- or two-day packs, more doctors would default to these more convenient dosing options, and we’d end the bad habit some doctors still have, where they write for 30 tablets at a time, or more. During the last two years, the FDA worked to change our approach to this crisis. We’ve committed to act more quickly as we confront new risks and to take a much more aggressive approach to regulatory action. We know that waiting for the accumulation of definitive evidence of harm left us a step behind a crisis that was evolving so quickly, we always remained one step behind its insidious advance. To address this burgeoning epidemic, we need to act forcefully, and sometimes take action before we have perfect information. That’s one tragic lesson we have learned. We need to consider aggressive new steps and embrace options that are tailored to the scope of this crisis and the unique aspects of addiction and opioids. One of the most important steps we could take is to consider the comparative advantage of new opioid approvals relative to other opioids already on the market. I’ve previously raised the question of whether there should be an explicit comparative standard for new opioid approvals that requires a demonstration of some advantage over the existing armamentarium, whether it relates to a differentiated way that a new opioid can address pain more effectively than the existing armamentarium or preferably, a characteristic that will also make a new drug safer than an existing alternative. The question is a simple one: In the setting of an opioid addiction crisis of historic proportions, why would the FDA approve a new opioid drug? The supply of drugs doesn’t create demand, and it’s wrong to assume that just because a new drug is introduced to the market, it’s going to lead to greater levels of abuse. But nonetheless, the underlying question is a fair one to ask. In the setting of an addiction crisis, if a novel drug may be eligible for a monopoly, should we demand that a new medicine prove that it has some benefit over existing drugs in terms of how it addresses pain and preferably, how it can help reduce the propensity for diversion and abuse? We wouldn’t ask these same questions in other therapeutic settings for a lot of practical reasons. But opioids are different. That is the lesson we’ve learned from this crisis. And so it’s reasonable to ask these questions here. Today, I come before you to say that, after careful deliberation, I believe that the FDA needs a new, comparative standard for future approvals of new opioid drugs. Given the public health crisis we face, and that American families are still being destroyed by the opioid epidemic, I believe that the FDA should treat opioids, as a class, differently from other drugs. The FDA has a structured benefit-risk assessment framework that applies to the approval of all new drug products. As part of that benefit-risk assessment, when approving new opioid drug products, the FDA carefully considers the benefits and risks of other available therapies, as well as the broader public health effect of opioids. These include risks related to misuse, abuse, opioid use disorder, accidental exposure and overdose, for both patients and non-patients. The FDA will soon be publishing draft guidance describing this existing benefit-risk assessment as it applies to new opioid analgesic approvals and providing recommendations to sponsors for the types of data that are useful to the agency in carrying out that assessment. However, based on a careful assessment of the factors that have contributed to the opioid crisis, the FDA has concluded that a new standard is needed to ensure that proposed new opioid drug products offer a comparative advantage over existing opioids already approved to treat the same condition. We need to consider opioids as a class differently than we evaluate other drug classes. We want to incentivize drug developers to focus on developing new opioid drug products that offer safety advantages, effectiveness advantages, or other material therapeutic advantages over already-approved opioids. For example, safety advantages might be reduced abuse liability, reduced incidence or severity of serious adverse events, or greater tolerability in particular subpopulations. An effectiveness advantage might be improved analgesia for particular subpopulations that could help doctors more narrowly tailor their prescribing of opioids to carefully selected settings that might, in turn, reduce overall prescribing. We hope this new approach would also incentivize developers to increasingly focus their efforts on non-opioid alternatives that could, eventually, begin to replace opioids as the drugs of choice in the armamentarium of drug products used to treat pain and address the risk of addiction. For this to work, the FDA believes that there should be a premarket demonstration that a new opioid is superior to an already-approved opioid or opioid-containing drug for the same general indication. The standard should be that a new opioid or opioid-containing drug provides a significant advantage relative to an already-approved opioid or opioid-containing drug for the same general indication in terms of greater efficacy or greater safety. We’ve carefully considered these concepts with the agency’s scientific experts. There is a consensus that such a standard could help the agency better address this crisis. Superiority under this standard could result from any physical aspect of the drug product – including the active opioid moiety, other active or inactive ingredients, a device constituent part, the dosage form, packaging, or other product attributes that the sponsor develops. Our goal is for this approach to include abuse-deterrent formulations to promote continued innovation in abuse deterrence properties. This type of approval framework could operate in conjunction with our existing program for breakthrough drugs, based on the significant advantages these products might offer, or it could be paired with a new designation program for all pain therapies that have preliminary evidence of safer or more effective performance. We want to find new ways to prioritize and make more efficient the development of novel treatments for pain that have the potential to offer significant advantages over our existing options. Drugs that meet the standard could get breakthrough designation or a new designation could be created to further prioritize their review. Eventually, Congress could consider how other incentives, including exclusivity periods, might help drive development toward drugs with safer attributes. Prescribers and payers also play an important role in combatting the opioids crisis. Our hope is that with a new approach by the FDA – one that’s focused on approving safer opioids and new non-opioid alternatives – market actors including payers, health care practitioners, and patients would preferentially select these new options if they became available and as appropriate for the subpopulation requiring pain management; thereby improving the overall safety, and potentially efficacy, of drugs used to treat pain, as well as any other condition of use for which an opioid may be approved. We understand it would take time to move to a new comparative advantage framework, and to meaningfully change our existing armamentarium to treat pain. But with this change, we can envision an eventual world where enough opioids, opioid-containing drug products, and non-opioid alternatives with comparative advantages are FDA-approved, including generic versions of such products, that the FDA could make the determination – under its current authorities – that either some or all of the older, conventional opioids for a specific indication no longer have a favorable benefit-risk balance; or that the benefit-risk balance of such products is only favorable for certain narrowed indications or under more restrictive conditions of use. We need to continue to act swiftly and forcefully to get ahead of this crisis. We need to consider novel policy options that are narrowly tailored to opioids. We need to recognize that this crisis is going to be hard to fully reverse. We need to be willing to embrace actions in the setting of opioids that we must accept would be unsuitable to any other drug category. A comparative advantage standard for new opioid drug approvals is one such approach. We don’t want to look back years from now, at an even larger crisis, with regret that there were more aggressive steps that we could have taken sooner to address this tragedy. At the FDA, we’ve considered all options, and we’ll continue to do so. We’ve concluded that we need to change our approach, and treat opioid approvals differently, in order to have the right tools to fight one of the largest and most complex public health tragedies that our nation has ever faced. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Deputy Commissioner Anna Abram on new 2019 efforts to improve the quality of compounded drugs", "date": "April 03, 2019", "contents": " We’ve long recognized that compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product. But compounded drugs are not approved by the FDA and, therefore, have not been evaluated for safety or efficacy. We’ve seen firsthand the harm they can cause patients when they’re not appropriately compounded. Over the past year, we’ve taken significant new steps to modernize and clarify our policies related to the quality of compounding in an effort to ensure continued access to compounded drugs for patients who need them, while also protecting patients from the risks of contaminated or otherwise harmful products. We’ve worked to refine our existing practices, shape new policies and increase the frequency of our communications with industry, Congress, states and patients concerning our programs. We anticipate that 2019 will be an equally productive year for the FDA’s compounding program, with better quality continuing to be our top priority as part of our ongoing effort to reduce the risks of these unapproved products. We have an obligation to advance our efforts to improve the quality of compounded products for consumers by ensuring we have a strong and modern regulatory framework in place. Toward these goals, we’re pleased to share our 2019 compounding priorities. The FDA will continue to work with stakeholders to improve the quality of compounded drugs for patients who need these products. In 2019, we’ll utilize appropriated funds provided in to lay the groundwork for the “Center of Excellence on Compounding for Outsourcing Facilities,” including trainings on current good manufacturing practice requirements for outsourcing facilities. The goal will be to bolster the quality of compounded drugs produced by outsourcing facilities. We’ll provide more updates and opportunities for public participation in this effort. Also, we’ll continue our effort to help compounders to identify in compounding facilities so they can implement appropriate corrective actions. We’ve highlighted some of the poor conditions that our investigators have found at some facilities. To help prevent these practices, we’ll work to finalize our guidance to promote activities that help compounders ensure their drugs are not prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions. While some compounders work hard to meet quality standards including avoiding insanitary conditions, we recognize that there are still compounders that are not in compliance. To address these risks, a key component of our 2019 work will be continuing to perform our risk-based inspection and pursue other enforcement efforts to identify compounders who produce drugs under substandard conditions or use inappropriate practices that could lead to serious harm. In 2018, the FDA sent warning letters to 23 facilities for adulterated product violations. These include insanitary conditions. We also worked with compounders on 50 recalls of products from the marketplace that raised safety concerns. Since 2018, FDA has entered into four consent decrees of permanent injunction to address the risk of patient harm from exposure to unsafe compounded drugs. In 2019, we’ll build on these and similar efforts, advance other new policies to strengthen our regulatory oversight and continue to help improve the quality of compounded drugs. Compounders sometimes produce a compounded drug starting from a finished, FDA-approved drug. Other times, they produce drugs using bulk drug substances, also known as active pharmaceutical ingredients. For example, when a patient has an allergy to an ingredient in an FDA-approved drug, a state-licensed pharmacist or physician, or an outsourcing facility, might compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance that does not contain the allergen. While some bulk drug substances can be used for compounding, other substances may not be suitable to be used for compounding. This may be a result of potential safety concerns raised by these products, or due to availability of a similar FDA-approved drug product that can be used to meet a patient’s medical need. We’re developing lists of bulk drug substances that compounders can use to compound from. These are the 503A bulks list and 503B bulks list. The names of these lists refer to sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and each list is used by different types of compounders. Section 503A applies to state-licensed pharmacies and physicians that have not registered with FDA as outsourcing facilities. They compound drugs only based on the receipt of a patient-specific prescription and may use bulk drug substances that are components of FDA-approved drugs, or drugs that have an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary (NF) monograph. They may also use substances that FDA places on the 503A bulks list. Section 503B applies to outsourcing facilities, which are not subject to the patient-specific prescription requirement that applies to 503A compounders and may compound and distribute drugs for healthcare facilities to hold as office stock. To help protect patients—and the integrity of the drug approval process—section 503B of the FD&C Act limits the bulk drug substances that outsourcing facilities can use in compounding to substances that are used to compound drugs in shortage or that appear on a list developed by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Earlier this year, we issued a establishing the criteria for evaluating substances nominated for inclusion on the 503A bulks list that state-licensed pharmacists and physicians can use to compound drugs and placing, for the first time, six bulk drug substances on the list. We plan to build on these actions by issuing another proposed rule to further amend the list of bulk drug substances that 503A compounders can use to compound drugs. This proposed rule, to be issued in 2019, would be based on FDA’s evaluation of additional bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A bulks list, identifying any additional bulk drug substances FDA proposes to add to the list, and also identifying bulk drug substances that the FDA has considered and is proposing not to include on the list of substances from which 503A compounders may use to compound drugs. The agency will continue to consider additional substances nominated by the public for inclusion on this list and will address them in future rules. We’ve also made a final decision regarding whether to on the 503B bulks list. The FDA will continue to update this list as it evaluates nominated bulk drug substances. Our recently issued describes FDA policies for developing the list of bulk drug substances under section 503B.. This year, we’ll continue to develop the bulks list for outsourcing facilities to limit compounding from bulk drug substances to circumstances where there’s a clinical need for such products. We’ll also continue to support research efforts on bulk drug substances with the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and through the FDA's Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. These efforts will help us advance the development of the bulks list. The two ongoing projects will help inform the public, and our regulatory decision-making—specifically the agency’s decision about whether to include certain substances on the 503B bulks list. Our collaboration with NASEM will also continue to examine the clinical utility of treating patients with compounded bioidentical hormone therapy products and the available evidence of the safety and effectiveness of multi-ingredient compounded topical pain creams. To secure our public health goals related to compounding, states play a critical role. We partner with them to address the potential risks associated with compounded drugs, while ensuring appropriate access. In 2019, we plan to finalize our between the FDA and the states. Through the MOU, FDA will further collaborate with the states so that, working together, we can have the greatest public health impact while maximizing our resources. For example, if a compounder distributes drugs to multiple states, it can be difficult to gather information about possible adverse events associated with those drugs, connect them to the compounder and undertake coordinated action to address a potentially serious public health problem without some assistance from the states. These challenges were illustrated by the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak. This tragic outbreak led to more than 750 cases of illness and the deaths of 64 individuals. The firm had used a compounded drug for injection that was supposed to be sterile but had become contaminated before distribution to patients and providers. Collaboration with the states has the potential to help prevent such serious and widespread outbreaks by helping to better identify adverse drug events and product quality issues across the country. The MOU will address traditional compounders that distribute a certain percentage, known as inordinate amounts, of their compounded drugs across state lines. Last September, we where states would agree to identify compounders that distribute more than 50 percent of their total prescription orders for compounded drugs interstate and report certain information to FDA about those compounders. Under the revised draft MOU, the states will also have greater flexibility on the mechanisms they can use to gather this information. We look forward to finalizing this agreement, taking into consideration stakeholder comments. The agency recognizes that hospital and health system pharmacies are different than other pharmacies not owned by hospitals and from conventional manufacturers, and as such, have unique needs and challenges. To that end, we plan to issue a revised regarding hospital or health system compounding to provide further clarification on how the FDA intends to apply section 503A of the FD&C Act to drugs compounded at these facilities. Our revised policies will also provide guidance for hospital or health system pharmacies that might be considering registering as an outsourcing facility under section 503B. Finally, we’ll continue to work closely with stakeholders on a number of other efforts that promote improving the quality of compounded drugs for patients who need them. Among our efforts, we’ll hold a in May 2019 to discuss current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for outsourcing facilities and gain public feedback to gauge the potential impact of proposed policies related to CGMP requirements on office stock access for health care providers. We’ll also hold additional listening sessions with stakeholders to better understand their views on key issues such as the substances included on the bulks lists and manufacturing requirements for outsourcing facilities as we develop policies that ensure appropriate access while protecting public health. We look forward to continuing to advance a robust compounding policy framework in 2019 as part of our commitment to fulfilling our vital consumer protection role. We recognize that there continues to be great interest in our work in this important program. We’re committed to providing detailed updates as we pursue additional actions on behalf of the American public.

{"title": "Statement by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., Director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Janet Woodcock, M.D. and Director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Peter Marks, M.D. on Expanded Access –Looking Forward", "date": "March 29, 2019", "contents": " For more than 30 years, the FDA has supported patients’ access to investigational medical products for treatment, outside of participation in a clinical trial, when appropriate. The FDA remains deeply committed to this effort. Helping to facilitate access to promising medicines for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available is a high priority for the agency. We cannot know in advance whether a drug obtained through expanded access (EA) will provide a benefit for these patients who have no other FDA-approved treatment options and cannot enroll in a clinical trial. But such access can often represent a patient’s final hope for a potentially effective treatment. For the mother with breast cancer, it may lead to extra time to attend a daughter’s graduation or offer a father with ALS the chance to be at his son’s wedding. Maybe such access can lessen suffering in the last few months of a patient’s life. Or maybe it enables a child with a rare and fatal disease to live many more years. Fostering these opportunities are among our most critical obligations. Since 2010, drug sponsors and manufacturers have given the opportunity of such access to more than 13,000 patients. The FDA applauds those companies. While pharmaceutical development is ultimately a business, health care is about people’s lives. Companies that innovate to develop effective new treatments show their commitment to the patients their drugs can potentially help by providing such access. The willingness of many sponsors to provide their products to patients at no cost or at the cost of manufacturing is a testament to their action on this public health commitment. As addressed in the preamble to our 2009 regulations, use of investigational drugs in treatment settings generally involves careful balancing that considers (i) the interests of patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases, who need to be able to make decisions about their health care, including using experimental therapies; (ii) the need to protect potentially vulnerable patients from unacceptable risks; and (iii) society’s interest in ensuring that treatments for these diseases are developed and approved for marketing to enable broad access. But sometimes, even in circumstances where the availability of a medicine through EA would appropriately balance these considerations, such access is not available. This is often true when it comes to the ability of patients to continue to use a promising medicine after the completion of a clinical trial. We are writing to encourage sponsors to offer EA in such circumstances, when continued access to a promising medicine at the completion of a clinical trial would be appropriate under the EA programs. Although we often focus on EA as providing access to patients who cannot enter clinical trials, EA can also be considered as a mechanism for those who have participated in a trial in order to allow them to continue receiving a drug that may have provided benefit. At the end of a trial, sponsors may continue to provide treatment to participating patients through an extension study to gather additional rigorous information that’s needed to support the subsequent marketing application. Alternatively, if the purpose is primarily to provide the drug to patients who continue to need it, an EA program may be used for either moderately sized populations (intermediate EA) or large size populations (treatment EA), often when most studies in support of approval have been completed. As another option, a sponsor could authorize a patient’s own physician to obtain a single patient EA investigational new drug (IND) application. Once a trial is complete, EA is generally available when clinical trial results show that the drug is effective in the studied population. However, sometimes drugs that have not shown benefit across the overall study population may still be providing benefit for individual patients. In such situations, EA may have a role in allowing patients to have continued access to the drug. We would generally support such efforts. Providing EA to patients who undertook the risks that are inherent to participating in any clinical trial is an acknowledgement of the contribution these patients have made to the overall drug development program. Of course, in situations where an experimental treatment is potentially associated with substantial risk -- and where the therapy has not been demonstrated to be effective in a trial -- continued access must be carefully considered by the physician and the patient, and weighed by the sponsor, especially if further development of the drug is being reconsidered. As mentioned previously, we know there are other considerations. A decision about whether to allow EA is weighed against the potential impact on the development program; the primary goal of any drug development program must be to expeditiously bring the drug to the market, thereby providing broad access to patients who need the drug. Many novel therapies are being developed by small companies that may have only a single product. The supply of investigational product may only be sufficient to support the clinical research trials, and not be adequate to support EA. In addition, certain biologics, such as cell and gene therapies, are particularly complex and expensive to manufacture, so the cost to the company of providing such access may be prohibitive. Of course, financial challenges and concerns about the impact on the development program may not be the only barriers. There are persistent misperceptions among pharmaceutical companies about the risks of providing a drug under EA, despite evidence to the contrary. We want to reassure sponsors that providing a drug under EA very rarely impacts development timelines. We urge sponsors to consider EA in appropriate settings; and especially after patients who are showing promise on an experimental drug complete therapy in a clinical trial setting. An FDA analysis of more than 10,000 EA applications from 2005 to 2014 shows that the incidence of a clinical hold due to an adverse event on an EA IND was 0.2 percent compared to 7.9 percent for clinical holds for all commercial investigational drug development programs. The two cases of clinical hold resulting from an adverse event in an EA IND occurred in response to the deaths of two cancer patients, who were receiving treatment under different EA INDs, shortly after infusion of the investigational drug. In both cases, the clinical holds were resolved. In addition, a review of more than 300 regulatory decisions between 2010 and 2016 shows that EA did not result in a negative decision on any application. In only one case did a final label include a drug interaction based on EA experience alone. The FDA reviewers understand that assessment of any serious adverse event that occurs during EA must consider the context in which the investigational drug is provided, as described in our guidance. It’s very rare that EA impacts a clinical development program in a negative way. In addition, while perhaps not commonplace, EA may add to the evidence for approval. For example, in the study on regulatory decisions discussed above, it was noted that the approval of uridine triacetate was based solely on experience within EA (60 single-patient INDs and 1 treatment protocol). In 2018, Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) was approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) based in part on data from over 1,200 patients who received Lutathera at a single site in the Netherlands, initially through an EA program. These are not the only examples where information from EA programs was combined with information from clinical trials and supported approval decisions. EA has been an important program, providing access to innovative therapies that can provide meaningful benefits to patients with serious diseases who lack therapeutic alternatives and cannot participate in clinical trials. We support efforts by sponsors to offer promising medicines to patients through EA. This includes continued access after the completion of a clinical trial, sometimes through an extension study. While EA may not be feasible in every situation, concerns about regulatory risks are often overstated. Such concerns are not supported by the data. At the same time, information from EA has sometimes proven valuable, contributing to the overall data available about a drug that is included in the marketing application. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on actions to advance our comprehensive plan to reduce tobacco-related disease and death, through new efforts to improve the tobacco product application review process, including a newly proposed rule", "date": "March 28, 2019", "contents": " on tobacco and nicotine regulation, unveiled in July 2017, aims to tackle the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. by focusing on two key areas: reducing the nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to render them minimally or nonaddictive; and harnessing new forms of nicotine delivery that could allow currently addicted adult smokers to get access to nicotine without all the risks associated with using combustible tobacco products. In order to secure these goals, and to advance our efforts to protect kids from the harms of tobacco products, we’re committed to issuing foundational rules to make the science-based regulatory review process more efficient, predictable, and transparent for manufacturers, while upholding the agency’s public health mission. In particular, it’s critical we have a strong, science-based application review process that ensures new products meet public health standards by evaluating important factors such as ingredients, product design and health risks. One way we can help achieve this is by developing new guidance and regulations to further clarify the rules of the road for what information the FDA needs in order to review and potentially allow new tobacco products to come to market. We’ve already made progress toward putting into place the proper scientific and regulatory foundation to efficiently and effectively implement the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, including some of our product application review processes, from stakeholders on that process and to provide additional information about the FDA’s science-based review and decisions to manufacturers. Today, we’re announcing several new actions as part of our commitment to ensure sound regulatory oversight of tobacco products and an effective application review process that considers the impact on public health. First, we’re issuing a that would establish requirements for the content and format of reports manufacturers must send to the agency to demonstrate the of a new tobacco product. This proposed rule, which will be open for public comment, will also provide information as to how the agency intends to evaluate these submissions. The SE pathway is one way in which a manufacturer can seek marketing authorization for a new tobacco product. In order for a new tobacco product to be substantially equivalent, the FDA must find that it either has the same characteristics as a ; or that it has different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product but the information submitted demonstrates that the new product does not raise different questions of public health. Examples of disciplines that may evaluate whether the new products can raise different questions of public health include engineering, chemistry, microbiology, toxicology, behavioral and clinical pharmacology and social science. For example, different product characteristics in those areas may impact initiation, cessation, frequency of use, patterns of use, and perceptions of harm or addictiveness among both youth and adults, and may result in a not substantially equivalent decision. Given the important factors the agency must consider in reviewing these products, it’s critical that manufacturers provide high-quality submissions to allow the FDA to make a determination. Over the past few years, the quality of SE Reports sent to the FDA has improved, but the reports submitted to the agency still range widely in the level of detail included. For example, some have very little information on the comparison of the new tobacco product with a predicate tobacco product while other SE Reports are much more detailed in describing how the new tobacco product compares to the identified predicate tobacco product and provide supporting information. Our experience reviewing this wide range of SE Reports has been helpful in developing this proposed rule, which describes in detail the information that an applicant would be required to include in an SE Report. Once finalized, the SE rule would formally set the minimum requirements for submitting SE Reports, allowing for greater predictability and efficiency for all stakeholders. Some of this information is currently outlined in agency guidance. We hope the proposed rule will bring greater uniformity to the consistency and completeness of SE Reports, and make the tobacco product review process more effective and efficient. Secondly, we’re providing additional information and resources on our website regarding several improvements to the tobacco product application process. Specifically, the FDA recently posted six SE Report Appendices on our to assist manufacturers preparing SE Reports. These appendices, which are broken down by product type, highlight common deficiencies that may result in an unfavorable SE decision. Additionally, as the proposed rule was being developed, we continued to receive input from stakeholders on the SE review process through their SE Report submissions, and FDA meetings and listening sessions with industry. Based on that input, the agency has already implemented additional improvements to the SE application process over the past several months, as mentioned during the October 2018 on the tobacco product application review process. In the interim, we expect these changes will provide industry more predictability on timelines for their review as we continue to work toward finalizing a rule. In particular, we’ve increased the time manufacturers have to respond to a deficiency letter and provided applicants with more time to amend their applications prior to scientific review. These improvements will allow manufacturers to develop and submit higher quality and more complete applications in a timely manner. As a result of these improvements, the agency recently announced it no longer intends to grant requests for extensions in response to deficiency letters. We’ve already implemented these improvements, but we’re also seeking input from industry on the appropriate timelines for this process as part of the public comment period for the proposed rule. Lastly, we’re releasing the latest results of internal the FDA has had in place for several years to help improve the timeliness and predictability of the review of certain applications. The data show we surpassed a majority of our performance goals in fiscal year 2018. For example, the FDA reviewed and acted on 95 percent of regular SE Reports within 90 days—better than the goal of 80 percent. This is also marked improvement from the 73 percent achieved in the previous fiscal year. These are just some of the steps we’re taking to lay a solid foundation that will continue to allow the FDA to protect the public health by regulating the manufacture, distribution and marketing of tobacco products. Among other things, we also intend to issue regulations outlining what information the agency expects to be included in Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTA) and Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) applications. We also intend to explore product standards for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, including e-cigarettes) and other tobacco products, as well as to propose rulemaking requiring manufacturers to establish tobacco product manufacturing practices. Additionally, we plan to finalize guidance on how we intend to review PMTAs for ENDS, and we will continue our efforts to assist industry in complying with federal tobacco laws through online information, meetings, webinars and guidance documents. We also continue to give guidance to individual manufacturers who are considering filing PMTA and MRTP applications with the agency. We have expressed a lot of concern around the tragic rise in youth use of e-cigarettes. Some of the leading manufacturers of these products have likewise made public commitments to address these trends. We would welcome the opportunity to engage a manufacturer on the filing of an application for one of these e-cigarette products. The application review process provides a foundational vehicle for properly weighing the public health tradeoffs of these products. To date, no manufacturer has submitted a complete application with the FDA seeking a PMTA or MRTP authorization for an e-cigarette. We’re committed to using all the tools at our disposal to ensure our comprehensive plan on tobacco and nicotine regulation meets its objectives to significantly reduce tobacco-related disease and death, including a particular emphasis on protecting kids from the dangers of tobacco products. Protection of the public health is paramount and it’s critical we put tobacco products through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to ensure they meet the standards under the law. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "FDA approves treatment for patients with a type of inflammatory arthritis", "date": "March 28, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) injection for treatment of adults with a certain type of inflammatory arthritis called non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), with objective signs of inflammation. This is the first time that the FDA has approved a treatment for nr-axSpA. “Today’s approval of Cimzia fulfills an unmet need for patients suffering from non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis as there has been no FDA-approved treatments until now,” said Nikolay Nikolov, M.D., associate director for rheumatology of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Nr-axSpA is a type of inflammatory arthritis that causes inflammation in the spine and other symptoms. There is no visible damage seen on x-rays, so it is referred to as non-radiographic. The efficacy of Cimzia for the treatment of nr-axSpA was studied in a randomized clinical trial in 317 adult patients with nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation, indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and/or sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) on MRI. The trial measured the improvement response on the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score, a composite scoring system that assesses disease activity including patient-reported outcomes and CRP levels. Responses were greater for patients treated with Cimzia compared to patients treated with placebo. The overall safety profile observed in the Cimzia treatment group was consistent with the known safety profile of Cimzia. The prescribing information for Cimzia includes a Boxed Warning to advise health care professionals and patients about the increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis (infection in the blood steam), invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis, an infection that affects the lungs), and other infections. Cimzia should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Health care providers are advised to perform testing for latent TB and, if positive, to start treatment for TB prior to starting Cimzia. All patients should be monitored for active TB during treatment, even if the initial latent TB test is negative. The Boxed Warning also advises that lymphoma (cancer in blood cells) and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, of which Cimzia is a member. Cimzia is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Cimzia must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Cimzia was originally approved in 2008 and is also indicated for adult patients with Crohn’s disease, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The FDA granted the approval of Cimzia to UCB. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new indication for valve repair device to treat certain heart failure patients with mitral regurgitation", "date": "March 14, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved a new indication for a heart valve repair device that is intended to reduce moderate-to-severe or severe mitral regurgitation, a leakage of blood backward through the mitral valve into the heart’s left atrium that can cause heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling in the legs. When first , the MitraClip Clip Delivery System (MitraClip) was indicated to reduce mitral regurgitation in certain patients whose significant mitral regurgitation and heart failure symptoms result from abnormalities of the mitral valve (commonly known as primary or degenerative mitral regurgitation) and whose risks for mitral valve surgery are prohibitive. The new indication, approved today, is for treatment of patients with normal mitral valves who develop heart failure symptoms and moderate-to-severe or severe mitral regurgitation because of diminished left heart function (commonly known as secondary or functional mitral regurgitation) despite being treated with optimal medical therapy. Optimal medical therapy includes combinations of different heart failure medications along with, in certain patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantation of cardioverter defibrillators. “Expanding the approval of this device to heart failure patients with significant secondary mitral regurgitation, who have failed to get symptom relief from other therapies, provides an important new treatment option,” said Bram D. Zuckerman, M.D, director of the Division of Cardiovascular Devices in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Careful evaluation by a team of specialists is essential to determining whether a particular patient is an appropriate candidate for this procedure.” About 6.5 million American adults live with heart failure, a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs for blood and oxygen. A small percentage of these patients also have moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation, increasing the risks and complicating the treatment of their heart failure. With this new approval, this small percentage of patients could be indicated as candidates for treatment with the MitraClip device when combined with optimal medical therapy. The MitraClip is inserted in a minimally invasive procedure through the femoral vein in the leg and guided into the heart’s left ventricle where it grasps the two leaflets of the mitral valve, clipping them together to reduce the backflow of blood. The approval of the new indication is based on a with heart failure who had moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation and were randomly assigned to get either continuation of their optimized medication treatment plus the MitraClip (MitraClip group) or continuation of their optimized medication treatment only (control group). The risk of being re-hospitalized for heart failure symptoms was reduced by approximately 47 percent in the MitraClip group compared to the control group. In addition, the risk of death within two years was decreased by approximately 37 percent in the MitraClip group compared to the control group. Potential adverse events from the device and implant procedure include death, stroke, major bleeding, and erratic heart beat (atrial fibrillation). The MitraClip is contraindicated in patients who cannot tolerate blood thinners during or after the procedure, who have active inflammation (endocarditis) of the mitral valve, rheumatic mitral valve disease or evidence of blood clots in the heart or veins leading to the heart. The MitraClip Clip Delivery System is manufactured by Abbott Vascular Inc. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Jeff Shuren, M.D., Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on efforts to evaluate materials in medical devices to address potential safety questions", "date": "March 15, 2019", "contents": " We’re in an unprecedented era of innovation in medical devices with advances in materials science that have led to technological breakthroughs such as the 3D printing of medical devices, continuous glucose monitoring patches for diabetes and miniaturized brain implants to treat epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Helping to ensure patients have access to safe medical devices that improve function and overall quality of life is a crucial part of the mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Our regulatory framework is designed to ensure that benefits patients receive from these devices are weighed against probable risks. The vast majority of patients implanted with medical devices have no adverse reactions. The device works and performs as expected to treat medical conditions or help patients better manage their health. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that a small number of patients may have biological responses to certain types of materials in implantable or insertable devices. For example, they develop inflammatory reactions and tissue changes causing pain and other symptoms that may interfere with their quality of life. Materials used in today’s medical devices vary as widely as the devices themselves—whether the material is metal, plastic, silicone, an animal-derived product or some combination of these. Because, in the case of implantable or insertable devices, these materials come into contact with tissue or other parts of the body for sometimes extended periods of time, we do a careful evaluation during our premarket review to determine if there is a potential adverse biological response resulting from contact of the device’s component materials with the body and whether the associated risks are unacceptable. Specifically, we review information about the materials used in the composition of the device and require companies to include a biocompatibility evaluation or risk analysis, as well as clinical studies, when appropriate. In 2016, we for industry laying out what we look for in biocompatibility evaluations in order to ensure device manufacturers have adequately assessed the potential of their device to cause adverse biological responses in patients. By clarifying expectations for all devices requiring premarket submissions, we are helping to ensure that manufacturers are providing evidence that demonstrates that any risk to patient health or safety has been adequately evaluated prior to marketing. These steps help to address any risks that may be posed by, for example, the potential presence of harmful chemicals or materials that might trigger allergic or other adverse reactions in some individuals. While such testing generally has been a reliable predictor of a material’s safety, we also recognize the importance of advancing the science we rely on to evaluate device materials and patient risk factors both before and after devices enter the market to assure we optimally reduce risks to patients and maximize benefits. Once a device is on the market we have a number of tools in place to monitor a device’s benefit-risk profile as it is used in a real-world setting. In cases where new information about safety or effectiveness becomes available, we can and have taken action to inform patients and health care providers about new risks or safety considerations and how to mitigate those risks. These actions include working with companies to recall and correct issues that arise postmarket, issuing safety communications or other updates for health care providers or patients about safe use of devices, requiring boxed warnings or contraindications be added to labeling, requiring postmarket studies, and up-classifying devices to allow us to regulate them more stringently, as we did with metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices. We are also working to fully implement the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) that will link and synthesize data from different sources including clinical registries, electronic health records and medical billing claims; this will help improve the quality of real-world evidence that will empower the FDA to more quickly identify, communicate and act on new or increased medical device safety concerns. Our understanding of medical technologies evolves over time. As we learn more about long-term effects of materials and as materials science advances and new innovations become a reality, it’s imperative our regulation of devices evolves along with these advances to ensure patients are protected. Prior to, and as part of, our , the FDA has been carefully evaluating the body of evidence on this issue. This includes current published studies, and information submitted to us as reports in our public adverse events database or through data from postmarket studies that we required manufacturers to conduct. We also have our own team of FDA scientists and engineers conducting research to better understand device materials in our Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL). Based on our evaluation and discussions with experts elsewhere in the government and academia, we believe the current evidence, although limited, suggests some individuals may be predisposed to develop an immune/inflammatory reaction when exposed to select materials. The symptoms some patients experience may be limited to the region where the device is implanted or may be more generalized. Symptoms include but are not limited to fatigue, rash, joint and muscle pain or weakness. Although uncommon and varied, these symptoms may share common underlying immune/inflammatory pathways and mimic more well-established inflammatory conditions. In the small subsets of patients who have reported these symptoms, the symptoms may not develop for several years following implantation. As a result, they may not be detected even in larger and longer clinical studies. To date, these symptoms have not been reported with most materials used in medical devices, including most metals. Moreover, when reported, they have tended to be limited to small subsets of patients. As an example, some patients, mostly with a history of pre-existing allergies, may develop allergic skin lesions with certain device use. This risk is usually identified by patch testing for potential device material-related allergens. However, not all device-related reactions are allergic in nature. Therefore, the utility of skin patch testing is limited. Enhancing our collective understanding of materials science could lead to identifying materials that may cause an exaggerated response in sensitive individuals and advance the development of safer materials. Development of new tests to identify at-risk patients would help ensure they do not receive implantable devices that contain the material to which they are sensitive, therefore further enhancing patient safety and advance a precision medicine approach to the selection of device interventions. It’s clear more work needs to be done. To this end, we’re undertaking a broad effort to engage the public, scientists and industry stakeholders to gather information and help us determine the current state of the science, critical gaps in the existing science that need to be addressed, what approaches should be considered to further our understanding of medical device materials and improve the safety of devices for patients. Breast implants have a silicone outer shell, with either a textured or non-textured surface, and are filled with silicone gel or saline. The FDA has regularly communicated about , such as capsular contracture, implant rupture and breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). More confirmed cases of BIA-ALCL have been reported in patients with textured surface implants than in patients with smooth-surface breast implants. We’ve also heard from patients who are concerned that their implants may be connected to other health conditions that could be associated with their immune system’s response to these devices, resulting in symptoms like chronic fatigue, cognitive issues and muscle pain. While the FDA doesn’t have definitive evidence suggesting breast implants are associated with these conditions, we’re looking to gain a fuller understanding of this issue to communicate risk, minimize harm and help in the treatment of affected patients. This topic will be discussed at our upcoming of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel on March 25 and 26 and will be informed by our ongoing assessment of the long-term health effects of various materials. In addition, we’ve been coordinating on two different breast implant registries to learn more about how these devices perform and interact with the body’s tissues at the cellular and organ levels. For instance, we worked with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons/the Plastic Surgery Foundation to develop the Patient Registry and Outcomes for Breast Implants and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Etiology and Epidemiology ( . This registry collects real-world data regarding patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of BIA-ALCL. The data collected from this registry as well as from medical device reports submitted to the FDA, medical literature and meetings with patient advocates have contributed to our understanding of BIA-ALCL and our communication updates to the public regarding BIA-ALCL. Additionally, we’re working with multiple stakeholders to advance the development of the National Breast Implant Registry ( to provide a platform for evaluating real world data on the safety and performance of breast implants. This will help us better evaluate data from providers regarding their patients with breast implants. We’ll continue to report on significant findings as new information and analyses become available and if any of these findings prompt the agency to issue new recommendations or policies to mitigate risks. Metal device implants have been used in patients for more than a century, beginning with bone- stabilizing plates to heal fractures and advancing to state-of-the-art stents, prostheses and implantable defibrillators. Many implants are meant to remain in a patient’s body for years or even a lifetime. During this time, we know that tiny amounts of metals may be gradually released into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues. The FDA regularly conducts thorough reviews of the latest scientific evidence. We continue to find that most patients experience no adverse health effects from these metals interacting either locally where the devices are implanted or systemically throughout the body. However, after carefully reviewing the current scientific literature, reports in our public adverse event database as well as findings from post-approval and postmarket surveillance studies, we believe there’s a need to evaluate through a comprehensive process concerns that were brought to light with particular devices, such as metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices and the permanent birth control implant Essure, a coiled wire that’s composed of multiple metals, including nitinol (a nickel and titanium alloy) and stainless steel, and is inserted into a woman’s fallopian tubes. Last December, we announced a of the Essure device to, in part, better understand how the materials in the device interact with the body’s immune system. The FDA worked with Bayer, the manufacturer of the device, to make sure the company implemented several approved modifications to the study that we believe will strengthen the evidence collected. First and foremost, women in the study will be followed for five years, rather than the three years that were initially required. This extension will provide us with longer-term information on adverse risks of the device, including issues that may lead women to have the device removed. We also required additional blood testing of patients enrolled in follow-up visits during the study to learn more about patients’ levels of certain inflammatory markers that can be indicators of increased inflammation. This could help us better evaluate potential immune reactions to the device and define whether these findings are associated with symptoms that patients have reported in relation to Essure. These reported symptoms include persistent pain and hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, fatigue and cognitive difficulties. The use of nitinol in other devices has increased—particularly for cardiovascular stents, guidewires and other devices used in minimally-invasive medical procedures. This owes to the metal’s properties. Nitinol is flexible and bendable with the ability to spring back, like a Slinky, into its original shape. Many of the symptoms reported by some patients who had Essure implanted have not been reported by patients who had other nitinol-containing devices implanted, which could be related to the location of the implants. The particular site in the body where a device is placed may contribute to the potential for the device to cause an immune/inflammatory reaction. In the next few months, we’re planning to publish draft guidance on the use of nitinol in medical devices. This new guidance will include recommendations from the FDA on what manufacturers should include in their premarket submission of a device containing nitinol, including technical testing recommendations, labeling and information on how the device is manufactured and other factors that could affect the breakdown of the material in the body. Three years ago, the FDA of metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices requiring that manufacturers submit premarket approval applications to keep their devices on the market. That decision was based on significant safety concerns associated with adverse biological reactions to the metal wear particles and ions generated by the metal ball rubbing the metal socket joint during everyday use. These metal particles were found to have the potential to cause damage to the surrounding bones and soft tissues (including muscle) in some patients leading to pain, device failure and the need for repeat surgery to replace the implant. Some patients also developed severe systemic conditions, including damage to their heart, kidneys and thyroid, from the metal ions entering their bloodstream and reaching distant organs. There are currently no FDA-approved metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices marketed for use in the U.S. However, many patients still have these devices implanted in their body, and the FDA felt it was imperative that manufacturers continue to meet their obligations for completing their postmarket surveillance studies. Today, we’re sharing from these studies. The results show significantly higher blood levels of metal ions (cobalt and chromium) in patients with metal-on-metal hip implants compared to those without metal implants. While that’s not unanticipated, the data also suggest that the standard blood level threshold measurement of 7.0 parts per billion (micrograms/liter) or higher for metal ions, is not optimal to determine if an implant is functioning safely. Some patients in the postmarket surveillance studies had levels higher than this with no adverse medical complications, while others had severe symptoms with lower ion levels in their blood. This suggests that there are additional factors, besides metal ion levels, that affect which patients experience adverse events from metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices. In addition to the clinical evaluations, the postmarket surveillance studies included a detailed analysis of more than 2,000 devices from patients who elected to have their implants removed. On average, patients who had their devices removed had higher metal ion levels compared to other patients in the postmarket surveillance studies who didn’t. Also, the wear between the metal ball and metal socket was found to be higher than what was expected based on testing performed on the devices before they were allowed on the market. When considering all devices that were explanted, it appears that certain factors, including those related to the design or surgical placement of the device, may be associated with a higher wearing down of the device and elevated metal ion levels. Based on these findings, the FDA is working with standards development organizations (such as ) to develop new standards to improve how metal-on-metal total hip replacement devices are evaluated and identify additional testing protocols for new metal-on-metal devices that are submitted to the FDA for review. To help us gain a broader understanding of nitinol and other metals in devices, we’re announcing today that we plan to hold an advisory committee meeting this fall to discuss metal implants and the potential risk for certain patients to have “hypersensitivity” or exaggerated immune and inflammatory reactions to these metals. We’ve been exploring the link between immune and inflammatory markers and symptoms such as pain, headaches and fatigue in patients who have these devices implanted. This advisory committee meeting is part of our ongoing effort to advance the evaluation of materials used in implantable devices. The panel meeting will engage experts in the field to provide input on what relevant scientific information the FDA should solicit from manufacturers to be considered in both premarket review and postmarket surveillance. Importantly, we’d like to determine how to identify patients who might be at increased risk of having a hypersensitivity response before they receive a metal implant, so they can consider those risks along with the device’s benefits. An additional purpose of the meeting will be to identify gaps in current scientific knowledge to determine what studies are essential to further expand our understanding of this important public health issue, including to what extent immune/inflammatory responses to certain metals contribute to device-related adverse events and steps we can take to mitigate potential risks. Prior to this meeting, the FDA will release a peer-reviewed white paper that summarizes the current scientific knowledge regarding different aspects of metal implants, including how the structure and function of these devices are impacted by the body’s tissues, muscles and blood supply and how the metal components dissolve and interact with immune cells. These efforts are just a few aspects of our ongoing evaluation of the effects of materials in at-risk patients. Our goal in taking these steps is to ensure that the benefits of devices made of metal materials continue to outweigh their risks. For the vast majority of patients this is the case and will remain the case as we go through these steps. However, for certain small subsets of patients who exhibit sensitivities to select materials, we must determine what additional actions we should take to make sure they are protected and understand the unique risks they may encounter. We’re also making efforts to improve the safety of devices made from animal-derived materials such as additives used on device coatings or heart valves made from pig tissue. We know that animal-derived materials may provide benefits over metal or synthetic materials because they can more closely match the biophysical properties of tissues within the human body. But these materials may carry a risk of transmitting infectious disease when improperly collected, stored, or manufactured. Specifically, animal tissues can contain infectious agents known as prions, which cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Mad Cow Disease. Yesterday, we issued final guidance on to provide recommendations to device manufacturers for how to minimize the potential risk of transmitting these rare but serious infectious diseases while still providing patients access to beneficial devices made from animal-derived materials. We’re also beginning to see manufacturers incorporate new types of materials in devices. CDRH’s OSEL has been conducting a wide array of research studies to learn more about the new advances in device materials. For example, our scientists are looking to better understand and characterize an innovative form of carbon called graphene, which has enormous applications in biotechnology and device development because it is lightweight, flexible, a superb conductor of electricity and is many times stronger than steel. In anticipation of new device applications for, say, graphene-containing drug delivery systems or ultrasensitive biosensors that can be used with diagnostic tests, our scientists are working quickly to characterize and learn more about graphene’s chemical properties—both in terms of how durable it will be in medical devices and how it will interact with the body’s tissues and immune system. OSEL has also worked on understanding how nanoparticles—tiny particles composed of just a few atoms—in medical devices interact with the immune system and whether they’re causing any toxic effects in the body. While these advances are promising, OSEL researchers are working to ensure that the benefits of the new material outweigh any risks that may come from these particles interacting with human cells. Modernizing the regulatory framework pertaining to the FDA’s review of medical device materials requires a multi-step approach. We’ll gather input from patients, device manufacturers, researchers and physicians to learn more about their concerns and ideas for how the FDA should proceed. Any new initiatives we implement must be rooted in putting patient safety first and based on sound science. More closely evaluating the potential for certain materials to cause immune/inflammatory reactions in a small number of patients may improve our understanding of materials, help uncover ways to identify patients predisposed to these reactions and improve the overall safety and performance of medical devices. This is part of our continuing effort to advance opportunities for enabling modern materials to improve the performance of medical devices while also advancing our assurance of safety for these products. We look forward to providing updates about our progress and ongoing research. We believe our continuing efforts will ultimately provide patients and doctors with better access to more effective and safer medical devices. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new oral treatment for multiple sclerosis", "date": "March 29, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Mavenclad (cladribine) tablets to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults, to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. Mavenclad is not recommended for MS patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Because of its safety profile, the use of Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. “We are committed to supporting the development of safe and effective treatments for patients with multiple sclerosis,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The approval of Mavenclad represents an additional option for patients who have tried another treatment without success.” is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communications between the brain and other parts of the body. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. MS is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than in men. For most people, MS starts with a relapsing-remitting course, in which episodes of worsening function (relapses) are followed by recovery periods (remissions). These remissions may not be complete and may leave patients with some degree of residual disability. Many, but not all, patients with MS experience some degree of persistent disability that gradually worsens over time. In some patients, disability may progress independent of relapses, a process termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). In the first few years of this process, many patients continue to experience relapses, a phase of the disease described as active SPMS. Active SPMS is one of the relapsing forms of MS, and drugs approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS can be used to treat active SPMS. The efficacy of Mavenclad was shown in a clinical trial in 1,326 patients with relapsing forms of MS who had least one relapse in the previous 12 months. Mavenclad significantly decreased the number of relapses experienced by these patients compared to placebo. Mavenclad also reduced the progression of disability compared to placebo. Mavenclad must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy and fetal harm. Mavenclad is not to be used in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, health care professionals should evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of Mavenclad on an individual patient basis. Health care professionals should follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with Mavenclad. The drug should not be used in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after the course of therapy because of the potential for fetal harm. Mavenclad should be stopped if the patient becomes pregnant. Other warnings include the risk of decreased lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts; lymphocyte counts should be monitored before, during and after treatment. Mavenclad may increase the risk of infections; health care professionals should screen patients for infections and treatment with Mavenclad should be delayed if necessary. Mavenclad may cause hematologic toxicity and bone marrow suppression so health care professionals should measure a patient’s complete blood counts before, during and after therapy. The drug has been associated with graft-versus-host-disease following blood transfusions with non-irradiated blood. Mavenclad may cause liver injury and treatment should be interrupted or discontinued, as appropriate, if clinically significant liver injury is suspected. The most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Mavenclad in the clinical trials include upper respiratory tract infections, headache and decreased lymphocyte counts.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas on advancing new tools and science for implementing agricultural water requirements for produce safety", "date": "March 15, 2019", "contents": " A critical component to growing, harvesting, packing and holding of fruits and vegetables for human consumption involves the use of agricultural water—water that’s likely to come into contact with produce or food contact surfaces. This can include water used to grow crops, to clean harvested crops, and water sprayed on harvested produce in order to prevent dehydration. Because water can carry pathogens that can potentially contaminate crops, agricultural water is a known on-farm route of produce contamination. It can be a potential source of contamination as well as a means by which contamination can spread. Farmers may have numerous water sources available to them, including ground water sources like wells, and different surface water sources like ponds, rivers, creeks and canals. There are also upstream land and water uses that are beyond the control of growers that may impact agricultural water. The food safety landscape is shifting, in part, through our work to change the prevention paradigm with the implementation of preventative measures as part of the landmark FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), and new tools we now have that enable us to further bolster the nation’s food safety system. The diversity of how farmers source water used in the growing, harvesting, and packing and holding of produce can contribute to the challenges in implementing measures to efficiently mitigate potential risks. An important part of FSMA’s Produce Safety Rule includes agricultural water requirements for produce subject to the rule. These requirements are critical because we know safe produce and safe agricultural water go hand in hand. The Produce Safety Rule for the first time set forth science-based standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of fruits and vegetables. Over the last three years, as we’ve worked closely with farmers to implement this rule, we’ve identified areas of the rule’s agricultural water requirements that may need refinement or explanation to ensure they are protective of public health. We need to ensure that standards are strong enough to protect public health, but practical enough to be effectively implemented on farms. To fully achieve these goals, we’ve previously outlined in detail, in a proposed rule, why additional time is needed. In September 2017, we proposed to delay the compliance dates for the rule’s agricultural water requirements. Today, we’re re-affirming our commitment to stick to that revised schedule and providing an update on our progress toward this goal. Specifically, we’re announcing a final rule to formally extend compliance dates for the rule’s agricultural water requirements for large farms to January 2022, small farms to January 2023, and very small farms to January 2024. This extension period is applicable to all produce subject to the Produce Safety Rule’s requirements, other than for sprouts, which were required to meet compliance dates that have passed. The final rule’s compliance date extensions have been previously announced in the proposed rule. The dates have not changed, and we are committed to this schedule, and making sure no further extensions are needed. The extension is designed to provide additional time to ensure the FDA applies the best thinking to clarify standards for pre-harvest microbial water quality and to continue working closely with produce farmers on sensible approaches to protect consumers. While the produce industry has adopted many measures to promote the safety of agricultural water, we want to make sure that federal requirements reflect the most modern, robust, and practical measures. The final rule, “ ,” finalizes the compliance date extensions related to agricultural water, but produce remains subject to all the other requirements in the rule, as well as the adulteration provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We continue to work with stakeholders on the agricultural water requirements, and efforts to make sure that water is suitable for its intended use, and that farms continue using good agricultural practices to maintain and protect the quality of their water sources, and ensure that the food they produce is not adulterated under the FD&C Act. We know that fresh produce is an important part of an overall healthy diet and the vast majority of fresh produce we eat is safe. Unfortunately, foodborne illnesses and outbreaks are still being linked to fresh produce. This includes romaine lettuce. We recently issued an following our investigation into a spring 2018 multi-state outbreak of infections linked to romaine lettuce from the Yuma growing region. Our environmental assessment noted that this outbreak most likely occurred from water used on multiple farms from a contaminated irrigation canal. A separate investigation was launched following a different outbreak announced last fall linked to romaine lettuce grown in certain California counties. Our on last fall’s outbreak outlined how the strain of associated with this outbreak was found in the sediment of one farm’s water reservoir, suggesting the pathogen may have lingered in the environment or was repeatedly introduced into the environment. The additional time provided by the extension of the compliance dates for the agricultural water requirements will allow the FDA and the produce industry to apply lessons learned from these recent outbreaks and adopt the best thinking as we continue to build upon our nation’s food safety practices. Our ultimate goal is to better protect fresh produce from contamination. The two, recent outbreaks involving romaine lettuce also highlight the differences in the production of just one type of a subset of produce. We know that the produce farming community is diverse, as are farming practices across our country and around the world. We’ve learned about some of the unique challenges farmers face in implementing these new FSMA requirements. That’s why it’s so important to make sure that our agricultural water standards work across the variety of farms, commodities and regions. To accomplish this important goal, the agency will incorporate the lessons we’ve learned from consulting with experts in produce safety, water systems, and water microbiology, from both the public and private sectors on the very latest scientific developments and what we’ve learned from the recent outbreaks. We’ll also incorporate the information we’ve learned from visiting farms throughout the country and our dialogue with our state and regional contacts to solidify our steps related to agricultural water. Our primary goal is the protection of public health, including protection of consumers. This is at the heart of our mission. Ultimately, we’ll implement requirements that are modern, efficient, rigorous, and achievable. We remain firmly committed to science-based requirements directed to agricultural water to minimize the risk to public health. We look forward to continued engagement with stakeholders in the coming months as we further consider the path forward on agricultural water. The FDA, our state and international regulatory partners and the produce industry all have shared food safety goals. We’ll continue working collaboratively to enhance the safety of the produce Americans enjoy. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on Administration’s request for new FDA funding to continue to advance robust regulatory framework for oversight of e-cigarettes, prevent youth access and initiation; and harness innovation to advance the safety of food, compounded drugs, U.S. bl", "date": "March 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration holds critical responsibilities for ensuring the safety, effectiveness and security of human and animal drugs, biological products and medical devices; as well as ensuring the safety of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics and radiation-emitting products; and regulating tobacco products. Advances in medical science, product manufacturing, nutrition and digital technologies give us new ways to advance our mission to protect and promote public health, delivering more of the benefits of innovation and market competition to patients in a safe and timely manner. These same opportunities give us additional tools to secure our fundamental consumer protection mission. Leveraging these opportunities requires us to make ongoing investments in regulatory science that can protect patients and consumers, while also reducing uncertainty for innovators through modern, risk-based regulatory standards; spur investments in new industries and technologies that can improve the health of patients and consumers; secure the safety of food products; and promote competition through more affordable generic and biosimilar products, expanding patient access to effective treatments. Toward these goals, the FDA’s budget request of $6.1 billion as part of the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 budget includes a requested increase of more than $643 million compared to the 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution (CR) (or $419 million compared to the FY 2019 Enacted Budget) to support urgent public health priorities and help support our core consumer protection mission. This includes more than $220 million to continue advancing new initiatives that will promote medical product innovation. I want to provide some highlights on some of the high priority initiatives that we seek to fund. Among the goals that we plan to pursue through these resources: These additional funds will help the agency combat the opioid epidemic; advance new steps to support the production of quality compounded drugs; expand the FDA’s capacity to review human food and animal feed ingredients; and continue implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act to advance patient-centered medical innovations. Funded programs will also improve food safety and provide consumers with greater information about healthy food choices using the most up-to-date science, modernize our oversight of dietary supplements and advance new innovations to improve the safety of the U.S. blood supply. Importantly, the budget also seeks $100 million in new tobacco fees, and includes manufacturers and importers of deemed tobacco products, in particular and especially electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and certain other products within the FDA’s tobacco user fee assessments. E-cigarettes, in particular, represent an increasing share of the tobacco marketplace. The new resources will support the FDA in its continued efforts to create a modern regulatory framework for the appropriate oversight of e-cigarettes and in taking continued steps to reduce youth use of all tobacco products. One of our most important public health efforts is to continue standing up a framework to make sure we can put e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates, and aggressively confront youth use of these products to make sure children don’t become addicted to nicotine. The agency strives to continually strengthen our capacity for using modern regulatory science and efficient, risk-based decision making to advance our public health mission. The investments and commitments we’ve outlined in our FY 2020 budget will help the FDA advance our shared public health goals, meet current and emerging public health challenges and harness the full potential of precision medicine and digital technologies to improve health and reduce the burden of serious chronic illnesses. Here's a closer look at some of the key initiatives and investments that we plan to pursue through both the FY 2020 budget request and the FY 2019 funding provided by Congress in February: The opioid crisis is one of the largest public health tragedies that our nation has ever faced and, despite recent reductions in fatal overdoses in some states and reductions in the prescribing of opioids that could translate into reduced rates of new addiction, it remains the largest public health crisis facing the FDA. The FDA continues to advance activities to stem and reverse the opioid epidemic through four key priorities: First, our primary goal is to decrease unnecessary exposure to prescription analgesic opioids and, in turn, reduce the rate of new addiction. We’re pursuing this goal through a broad range of efforts, including through evidence-based prescribing, and also steps to reduce the amount of excess opioid analgesics available for diversion. At the same time, we’re focused on helping individuals with opioid addiction return to lives of sobriety through access to effective medication assisted treatment (MAT), and reducing the stigma associated with the use of MAT. We’re also facilitating development of novel non-opioid alternatives that can provide important new treatment options for pain management. We’re increasing our enforcement activities to crack down on the illegal sale of opioids in partnership with Customs and Border Protection through our existing infrastructure and additional lab capacity at the International Mail Facilities, to bolster our ability to interdict illicitly manufactured opioids. Finally, we’re taking steps to crack down on the illegal sales of opioids on the surface and dark web. Our budget request helps increase our field and center operational capacity to enable review of up to 100,000 packages annually, to bolster our interdiction efforts aimed at protecting consumers from unsafe products. The FDA is also continuing our historic efforts to reduce the death and disease associated with the use of combustible tobacco products and reduce youth use of any tobacco product. Our FY 2020 budget request seeks an additional $100 million in tobacco fees and includes manufacturers and importers of deemed products, in particular ENDS products, and certain other products within the FDA’s tobacco user fee assessments. The FDA is fully committed to a pathway for the efficient and effective regulation of ENDS products. These products have the potential to offer currently addicted adult smokers a way to fully transition off cigarettes, but still enable them to get access to satisfying levels of nicotine, but potentially without the same risks as combusting tobacco. But the e-cigarettes must be put through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to properly assess their risks and to understand their potential to help smokers who completely switch from combustible tobacco. For example, we have studies underway—including investigations that the FDA commissioned—to look at the potential for direct effects of harm from e-cigarettes on the lungs and other health factors that these products could negatively impact. This also includes the potential for products to cause changes that could be a precursor to cancer. We should be concerned about these potential risks and must have a regulatory program that can fully evaluate them. This is one reason why we so strongly believe that no child should be using an e-cigarette or any other tobacco product. With these new resources, we’ll continue to advance policy steps to address youth use of these products. The FDA will take action to make sure that a new generation of kids does not become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes. These new resources will help support these and similar efforts in pursuit of critical public health goals. Efficient global markets for food production and distribution allow American families access to a wide range of wholesome and affordable food choices that can improve their health. We want to provide Americans the benefits from access to this global market, while reducing risks from foodborne illnesses. To advance these goals, we’re strengthening our response capabilities to foodborne disease outbreaks by improving our capacity to detect early signals associated with foodborne illness and shortening response timelines once human or animal food contamination is detected. The Budget includes an increase of more than $16 million to improve signal detection of foodborne illness and strengthen the FDA’s response to human and animal food contamination. This will allow the FDA to identify and trace outbreaks of illness to their source and remove contaminated food from the marketplace as quickly as possible to reduce risk to consumers. We also need to make sure that consumers are quickly informed when risks are identified, and that the FDA takes swift action to reduce exposure to food that could threaten peoples’ health. To further support these efforts, we’re also implementing recent recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General for strengthening the FDA’s food recall process. As part of our ongoing implementation efforts related to the Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA), the FDA also proposes allocating additional funds to provide preventive controls inspections and produce safety inspections through the state cooperative agreement programs. To advance these goals, the budget also includes an increase of nearly $16 million to support state cooperative agreements to increase preventive controls inspections and human food produce safety inspections. Our efforts will help ensure that manufacturing and processing facilities can efficiently comply with the new FSMA requirements. Innovations in plant and animal biotechnology offer tremendous opportunities for advancing public health. Promising new technologies have the potential to improve human and animal health, animal well-being, food productivity and food security. The FDA will continue to facilitate the safe development of these emerging technologies by investing in continued enhancements to our review capabilities for biotechnology products and other novel products, assessing these products in a risk-based manner to provide predictable commercialization pathways that can foster product innovation and market access in a safe and timely way, and improve consumer nutrition. We’re also investing in premarket safety reviews of animal food ingredients to improve review times and eliminate unnecessary burdens to industry. The Budget invests $36 million above FY 2019 to provide the FDA additional capacity to review human food and animal feed ingredients. This initiative includes a proposed user fee for Innovative Food Products, which the FDA will develop in collaboration with industry and other stakeholders. The U.S. blood supply is a critical national public health resource, and it is among the safest in the world. The FDA is responsible for regulatory oversight of the blood supply, including the promulgation and enforcement of standards for blood collection and for the manufacturing of blood products, including both transfusable components made from whole blood, pharmaceuticals derived from blood cells or plasma and related medical devices. The FDA also inspects blood establishments and monitors reports of errors, accidents and adverse clinical events, and works closely with other parts of the Public Health Service to establish blood standards, and identifies and responds to potential threats to the blood supply. The risk of transfusion transmitted infections, though low, nonetheless persists despite major advances in risk reduction that have been achieved by a combination of donor screening and laboratory testing. Some of the most significant challenges can arise from new or emerging infections when we haven’t yet identified the potential pathogen, or developed and implemented screening and testing measures to mitigate the risks. There are alternatives to donor screening and laboratory testing that can potentially mitigate such significant unknown risks while offering an additional assurance of safety from known risks, and also be associated with a reduction in the screening cost for each unit of blood processed. Pathogen reduction technologies, which are currently available for platelets and plasma, aim to improve our protection from risks posed by viral and bacterial pathogens that can be found in blood. To help advance these technologies for purposes of regulatory safety and oversight, we must implement policies encouraging the development and implementation of these innovations. The Budget includes $20 million to pilot this technology as a tool that could help eliminate contaminating viruses and other microorganisms from whole blood and still allow its subsequent separation into various blood components. This pathogen reduction technology could eventually help protect the blood supply from existing and emerging pathogens and, if successful, could potentially reduce or eliminate certain existing donor deferral and testing requirements. If this technology could be incorporated broadly, it could enhance national security by enabling a blood supply that would be safe in the face of a wide variety of emerging pathogens, and deliver these protections for a potentially lower cost than those that would be associated with current screening methods. The practice of compounding medicine can provide important public health opportunities. The FDA’s compounding program—including implementation of the compounding provisions of the law—is a priority for the agency. We recognize that we must balance the need to preserve access to appropriately compounded drugs for patients who have a medical need for these products with the need to help protect patients from poor quality compounded drugs that could cause harm. Although compounded drugs can serve an important role for certain patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product, it’s important to understand that compounded drug products haven’t undergone FDA premarket review for safety or effectiveness. We’ve taken steps in recent years to advance this goal and we’ve shared priority areas that we’re focusing on in our 2018 Compounding Policy Priorities Plan. To address both the need for, and safety of, compounded products, the FDA is supporting new policy development for outsourcing facilities, including efforts to improve the quality of outsourcing facilities’ compounded products. We’re also helping address providers’ needs for office stock of compounded medications. In 2020, for example, we’re standing up a Compounding Center of Excellence, to provide training programs on good manufacturing practices for outsourcing facilities, and adding a cadre of inspectors for outsourcing facilities. By engaging with outsourcing facilities and states, we can help the domestic outsourcing facility industry grow and adhere to quality standards to protect patient health, including by finalizing guidance and developing a rule for good manufacturing practices for outsourcing facilities, and evaluating hundreds of nominations for the bulks list. The Budget provides $76 million for these and additional efforts, an increase of $25 million above the FY 2019 annualized CR level. It will support compounding activities to better inform facility, process and system design; establish a list of bulk drug substances that can be used by outsourcing facilities; increase engagement with industry to promote compliance; and help pharmacies that want to become outsourcing facilities efficiently engage the regulatory process. We’ve made important progress in recent years on putting forth and implementing more effective compounding policies. As the FDA defines and advances these policies, we’re committed to a framework that closely aligns with our mission to protect consumers and promote opportunities to improve health. The Budget also includes more than $220 million to continue advancing new initiatives to promote public health and new medical product innovation and spur growth in the domestic economy. Among those efforts is a proposal for $55 million for an initiative to build an integrated knowledge management system and portal for medical devices to enable safety issues to be monitored, and effectiveness to be evaluated, along the total life cycle of the device. This capability to better leverage pre-existing and new data in near real time is essential for implementing the FDA’s new approaches for digital health technologies, breakthrough devices, use of real-world evidence and cybersecurity. Overall, this will make medical device reviews, post-market surveillance and cybersecurity efforts significantly more efficient and informative. These efforts could also make medical product review cycles more efficient; allow the agency to more quickly identify and address safety signals and cyber vulnerabilities; and spur the development of innovative, safer, more effective medical devices. New science is giving us dramatic new opportunities to improve human health and advance the choices that consumers have to improve their health and wellbeing. The FDA recognizes that we’re at an inflection point when it comes to seizing these opportunities, and we’re modernizing our policies, processes and human capital to make sure we can seize these opportunities on behalf of Americans. At the same time, we need to confront and overcome critical public health challenges, including the opioid epidemic, poor nutrition and obesity, addiction to tobacco products and the rising cost of health care. The investments the FDA is seeking will help us meet these goals. We’re grateful for the Administration’s support of these initiatives and believe these new investments in our agency’s mission will ultimately lead both to better health outcomes for American families and to a more vibrant economy. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Federal judge enters consent decree against Texas compounder, Guardian Pharmacy Services", "date": "March 12, 2019", "contents": " A federal court ordered a Texas-based company to stop producing compounded drug products intended to be sterile until the company complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other requirements. According to the complaint, despite previous warnings from the FDA, Guardian Pharmacy Services continued to violate the law, putting patients at risk. U.S. Chief District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn for the Northern District of Texas entered a consent decree of permanent injunction against JMA Partners, Inc., doing business as Guardian Pharmacy Services, located at 7920 Elmbrook Dr., Suite 108, Dallas, Texas, as well as the company’s owner, Jack R. Munn. “Although compounded drugs can serve an important role for certain patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA approved drug product, compounded drugs can also pose unique risks. They’re not FDA approved and do not undergo premarket review for safety, effectiveness or quality. All drug compounders must comply with certain requirements, which can include current good manufacturing practice requirements, to avoid product quality problems and potential patient harm. The FDA is committed to helping ensure that compounded drugs are made under appropriate production standards. When we find compounders that violate the law by not adhering to requirements, and put patients at risk, we’re going to hold them accountable under the law,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “We’ve continued to see violative behavior among compounding pharmacies that put patients at risk, and we’re committed to taking enforcement actions when we identify significant issues. In this case, despite our warnings, Guardian continued to violate the law by distributing purportedly sterile drug products under poor conditions and numerous drugs were compounded and distributed without a specific-patient prescription. This case is yet another reminder of why unlawful compounding is fraught with risk, how bad actors who have the potential to significantly harm people persist and why the FDA’s work in collaboration with our state partners remains critical to protecting consumers. The FDA will invest in these oversight efforts to help assure appropriate safeguards for patients and to expedite enforcement actions against drug compounders that threaten the public health.” The government alleges that Guardian manufactured and distributed purportedly sterile drug products that were adulterated because the drugs were made under insanitary conditions and in violation of current good manufacturing practice requirements under the FD&C Act. Drugs prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions may have been contaminated with filth or rendered otherwise harmful to patients. According to the complaint, Guardian also manufactured and distributed drugs that were misbranded because their labels did not include adequate directions for patient use, which describe how to use a drug safely and effectively for its intended purposes. Some of Guardian’s drugs were also misbranded because their labels were false or misleading. Under the law, compounding facilities that are not registered as outsourcing facilities can only compound drugs pursuant to valid patient-specific prescriptions. The helps to ensure that drugs, which are not FDA-approved, that are compounded in these facilities, are provided to patients based on individual patient needs. Despite repeated warnings that Guardian was in violation of the law, they continued to distribute more than half of their drugs for “office-stock” throughout the country even though they did not produce those drugs in compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations, nor did they receive new drug approval, or provide adequate directions for use. The consent decree requires Guardian to cease sterile operations until it completes corrective actions, including hiring a qualified independent expert to inspect its facility to ensure the company is complying with the FD&C Act. Under the consent decree, Guardian may not resume sterile compounding operations until it establishes and implements, among other things, a comprehensive quality control system and receives authorization from the FDA. The FDA conducted an initial of Guardian in 2016 that resulted in a for insanitary conditions and other violations of the FD&C Act. In 2017, the FDA received concerning at least 43 patients who were administered eye injections of a drug compounded by Guardian containing triamcinolone (steroid) and moxifloxacin (anti-infective) during cataract surgery. These patients reportedly experienced various symptoms, including vision impairment, poor night vision, loss of color perception and significant reductions in best-corrected visual acuity and visual fields. The FDA’s into Guardian’s compounded triamcinolone-moxifloxacin product revealed a high percentage of an excipient, poloxamer 407, and the presence of potential process degradation products. The FDA conducted a follow-up in April 2018 and issued a risk alert to inform patients about these products in July 2018. In addition to operating in Texas, the company is licensed in other states including Arizona, Colorado, Iowa and Oklahoma. The U.S. Department of Justice filed the complaint on behalf of the FDA.

{"title": "FDA approves a new generic valsartan", "date": "March 12, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new generic of Diovan (valsartan). Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that treats high blood pressure and heart failure. The FDA prioritized the review of this drug application to help relieve the recent shortage of this critical medicine as a result of of generic valsartan products from several manufacturers due to the finding that certain lots of valsartan and other ARB medicines contain nitrosamine impurities. “We know that the ongoing recalls to prevent certain lots of valsartan that contain unacceptable limits of impurities from reaching patients has resulted in a shortage of these important medicines,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “So to address the public health consequences of these shortages, we’ve prioritized the review of generic applications for these valsartan products. When faced with a drug shortage situation, the FDA employs a number of strategies to help mitigate the effects of the shortage on patients. As part of that work, we look at where we may be able to prioritize review of pending generic applications of the medicine in shortage, or similar products. We hope that today’s approval of this new generic will help reduce the valsartan shortage, and we remain committed to implementing measures to prevent the formation of these impurities during drug manufacturing processes for existing and future products. We’ll continue to work with manufacturers so that more medicines like valsartan, that belong to a class of drugs called angiotensin II receptor blockers, can be approved that are free of nitrosamine impurities to continue to address this ongoing shortage.” Since last summer, the FDA has conducted a major investigation to address the presence of nitrosamine impurities in certain generic ARB products. The FDA has worked with companies to take swift action to remove any products with unacceptable impurities from the U.S. market, and continues evaluating other ARBs to ensure they are free of impurities. FDA scientists have made in understanding how these impurities may form during the manufacturing process and the agency is working with international drug regulatory agencies to make new testing methods available. The FDA has also engaged drug manufacturers and helped facilitate manufacturing process changes to ensure ARBs are free of detectable levels of nitrosamine impurities. Now that this risk has been identified, the agency is implementing new requirements to guard against the development of these impurities in drugs. In cases of severe shortages of critical medications, including the ongoing shortage of valsartan and now losartan products, the FDA plays an important role in mitigating these challenges. For example, the FDA can expedite review of a new or generic drug application that, if approved, may help mitigate or prevent such a shortage and to do so, prioritizes these inspections and reviews. The agency is also working closely with manufacturers to see if they can produce additional supplies of these medicines. FDA scientists are using the information learned from its investigation to evaluate all ARBs currently on the market and will also apply this information when assessing future applications to ensure that the manufacturing process can’t form these impurities. For this approval, the FDA evaluated the company’s manufacturing processes and also made sure they used appropriate testing methods to demonstrate that the valsartan product approved today does not contain NDMA or NDEA. The FDA’s assessment of the manufacturing processes for the product determined that there is no known risk for the formation of other nitrosamine impurities. The FDA continues to investigate ARB medicines that contain nitrosamine impurities and that do not meet the agency’s quality standards. The agency will continue to update the lists on FDA’s website of recalled products as more information becomes available from ongoing testing. If patients take an ARB drug product, they should check the lists periodically, as information may change. Not all ARB medicines have been recalled. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels, or arteries, at higher than normal pressures. is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on advancing new policies aimed at preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and cigars", "date": "March 13, 2019", "contents": " When we first announced our comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in July 2017, we outlined a framework to better protect kids and to significantly reduce tobacco-related disease and death. We are continuing to implement that framework today. It remains the blueprint for the agency’s tobacco-related policymaking. This framework first and foremost includes actions aimed at ultimately bringing us closer to our vision of a world where combustible cigarettes no longer create or sustain addiction – making it harder for future generations to become addicted in the first place and allowing more currently addicted smokers to quit or transition to potentially less harmful products. This plan puts nicotine at the center of our regulatory efforts. It seeks to regulate nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to render them minimally or non-addictive. At the same time, we’re advancing new policies to encourage the development of products that can deliver nicotine to currently addicted adult smokers without all of the harmful effects of combustion, including novel forms of With the significant strides made in recent years to reduce conventional smoking among both youth and adults, we appeared poised to overcome one of the most pernicious public health challenges of our times – the death and disease caused by cigarette smoking. Our multi-year policy framework will continue to accelerate these declines in tobacco use. However, it has become clear that a recent surge in e-cigarette use among youth, which had appeared to be leveling off at the time our comprehensive plan was first announced in July 2017, is threatening the progress we’ve made in reducing youth tobacco use. The most recent data show more than 3.6 million middle and high school students across the country were current (past 30 day) e-cigarette users in 2018. This is a dramatic increase of 1.5 million children since the previous year. The data also showed that youth who used e-cigarettes also were using them more frequently and they were using flavored e-cigarette products more often than in 2017. This is particularly troubling given that research shows that kids using e-cigarettes are more likely to take up combustible cigarettes. The epidemic-level rise in youth e-cigarette use has prompted a series of escalating actions by the FDA in both enforcement and public education. It has also required us to take a critical look at our policies and regulatory priorities. Evidence shows that youth are especially attracted to flavored e-cigarette products, and that minors are able to access these products from both brick-and-mortar retailers, as well as online, despite federal restrictions on sales to anyone under 18. We also continue to be concerned about cigar use among youth – flavored cigars in particular – which our enforcement work shows are also being illegally sold to minors. With these concerns in mind, today, we’re advancing our policies aimed at preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavored e-cigarettes and cigars. There are many aspects of these policies outlined in a published today, which we intend to review comments on and finalize as quickly as possible. We expect several things to happen because of these policy changes: Specifically, today, with the strong support of the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar, and President Donald J. Trump, the FDA is proposing to end our current compliance policy as it applies to flavored electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products (other than tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored). Previously, for all ENDS products on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016, the FDA had announced our intention not to enforce the premarket review requirements until August 2022, with the expectation that many such products would remain on the market. In addition, under this previous policy, we intended to continue deferring enforcement while an ENDS product’s application was pending review. Under the proposed policy announced today, we’re putting all manufacturers and retailers on notice: you may be subject to FDA enforcement for selling certain flavored ENDS products without authorization. We’ll prioritize enforcement to prevent the access and appeal of these products to kids. I’m taking this step to prevent youth access and address youth appeal of flavored ENDS. But because I believe that ENDS products still hold promise to help transition currently addicted adult smokers to potentially less harmful sources of nicotine, the FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement to focus on protecting youth from becoming addicted to nicotine. We’re proposing to prioritize enforcement of flavored ENDS products (other than tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored) that are offered for sale in ways that pose a greater risk for minors to access the products. For instance, we’ll consider whether the products are sold under circumstances, whether at retail or online, without heightened age verification. Our proposed policy provides examples of circumstances that we’ll consider – for example, if flavored ENDS products are sold in locations where minors can enter at any time (e.g., the entire establishment or an area within the establishment); or, for online sales, if the products are sold without an appropriate limit on the quantity that a customer may purchase within a given period of time, and without independent, third-party, age- and identity-verification services that compare customer information against third-party data sources, such as public records. We’re also specifically seeking comment on, among other things, whether there are new technologies that can help prevent youth access at retail locations and intend to consider the use of those tools when we finalize the guidance. Today’s draft guidance states our expectation that manufacturers of all flavored ENDS products (other than tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored) that remain on the market under circumstances to limit youth access and appeal also submit their premarket applications by Aug. 8, 2021. This is an important change in our expectations and enforcement priorities. For all flavored ENDS products, including any that continue to be offered for sale under circumstances involving heightened age verification, the FDA expects manufacturers to prepare and submit applications that demonstrate these products meet the public health standard by Aug. 8, 2021. In addition, we’re proposing to prioritize enforcement of unauthorized ENDS products that are targeted to minors or likely to promote use of ENDS by minors. Any efforts that entice minors to use tobacco products are of particular concern to the FDA. For example, the agency has already issued warning letters for products that resemble kid-friendly foods and drinks or that resemble other non-ENDS products that are often consumed by youth. Manufacturers and retailers are on notice that we’ll continue to be vigilant about efforts to make tobacco products that appeal to kids. At this time, we aren’t proposing to end our current compliance policy as it applies to tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored ENDS products, except for those products that are targeted to minors or likely to promote use of ENDS by minors. This approach reflects a careful balancing of public health considerations. Recent evidence indicates that mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS products are preferred more by adults than minors. We’re also aware that some adults may be using mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS products with the goal of ceasing combusted tobacco use, seeking health benefits at the individual level, and may be at risk of migrating back to cigarettes. We won’t ignore data regarding the popularity of mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS among kids, should the concern rise. We’ll continue to use all available resources to monitor the rates and use patterns among youth and adults for these products, and we’ll reconsider our policies with respect to these products, if appropriate. We’re also continuing our efforts aimed at enforcement and education. This summer, we’ll unveil the first television advertisement aimed at educating children about the risks of e-cigarettes. I call on others who are committed to these same goals to also consider stepping up their efforts aimed at educating children of the risks of tobacco products generally, and e-cigarettes specifically. E-cigarette use among kids has become so widespread, so pervasive, and so troubling, that we risk addicting an entire generation of children on nicotine and watching the dramatic gains we’ve made in reducing smoking rates be erased. If current trends regarding youth use of ENDS products persist, the agency will change our approach. These increases in youth use must stop. We cannot allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes. If the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey continues to show sharp increases in youth use of tobacco products, the FDA will consider additional measures to address this crisis. We’ll take all appropriate actions necessary to stop these rates from increasing. Additionally, we’re also taking steps to address youth use of flavored cigars. Recent data show that nearly 1.3 million middle and high school students across the country were current (past 30 day) cigar users in 2018. Youth continue to use these dangerous combusted tobacco products due, in part, to the availability and appeal of fruit and other flavors. And research shows that, compared to adults (25 or older) who smoke cigars, a higher proportion of youth use flavored cigars. These data also indicate that eliminating flavors from cigars would likely help prevent cigar initiation by young people. Flavors are added to cigars and other tobacco products for various reasons, such as reducing the harshness, bitterness and astringency of tobacco products during inhalation and to soothe irritation during use. Under the revised compliance policy, 30 days after the guidance is finalized, any flavored cigars (other than tobacco-flavored) that were on the market on Aug. 8, 2016, and that meet the definition of a new tobacco product, would be subject to enforcement. As a result, flavored cigar products that are not grandfathered tobacco products and lack marketing authorization would no longer be subject to the August 2017 Compliance Policy. The FDA would prioritize enforcement of such products if they did not come off the market 30 days after the final guidance. They would have to seek premarket authorization to be re-introduced to the market. Additionally, we’re moving forward with a proposed rule to ban all characterizing flavors in cigars. The FDA will continue to use our enforcement tools to ensure manufacturers comply with the law. We’ll continue to hold retailers accountable for illegally selling tobacco products to minors. Manufacturers have the means to control the distribution and sale of their products to retail customers by, for example, including or requiring terms, conditions, or controls in their contracts with downstream distributors (wholesalers, distributors, importers and/or retailers) to prevent youth access. Therefore, we’ll be looking to manufacturers of flavored ENDS and cigars to comply with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations and prevent the sale of their products to minors. Ultimately, we expect these steps designed to address flavors and protect youth will dramatically limit the ability of kids to access tobacco products we know are both appealing and addicting. Our proposal reflects a very careful public health balance between closing the on-ramp for kids to become addicted to nicotine through tobacco products, while allowing for the promise of an off-ramp for adult smokers through access to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery. We intend to review comments and implement the policies 30 days after the guidance is finalized. However, we’re hopeful manufacturers and retailers will begin taking voluntary steps to further curb youth access to and appeal of these products. As we’ve said before, responsible manufacturers certainly don’t need to wait for the FDA to finalize policies to act. They can immediately stop certain marketing and sales practices – the ones we believe contribute to the problem of youth access and youth appeal. Likewise, manufacturers need not wait to submit premarket tobacco product applications for ENDS products, flavored or otherwise. In 2017, when the agency extended certain compliance deadlines for newly deemed tobacco products, we recognized that, to promote higher quality applications, we could provide greater transparency about our recommendations and requirements through guidance and rulemaking.  We had already published some resources to aid industry application submission. For instance, the FDA has published the ; we’ve published the ; and we’ve conducted describing, among other things, the statutory requirements for premarket applications. We continue to develop proposed rulemaking regarding the requirements for premarket submissions. Manufacturers, however, need not wait to engage the agency. Our door is open, and we welcome discussions with ENDS products manufacturers about their preparation of premarket submissions. Our pledge to reduce youth use of e-cigarettes is deeply rooted and has broad support within the Trump Administration. Nobody wants to see children becoming addicted to nicotine. Our dedication to this effort will endure and our commitment to advancing our comprehensive framework will continue. Our policies have been announced and advanced through a careful and deliberate process that involved the formulation of a broad consensus among those whose efforts are needed in making sure that these rules and guidances come to fruition. We won’t tolerate a whole generation of kids becoming addicted to nicotine as a tradeoff for enabling adults to have unfettered access to these same unreviewed products, and we’ll continue to put the full scope of our regulatory tools against this mounting public health crisis. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. We expect that some flavored e-cigarette products will no longer be sold at all. We expect that other flavored e-cigarette products that continue to be sold will be sold only in a manner that prevents youth access, while premarket authorization for these products is sought from the FDA by 2021. We expect some flavored cigars will no longer be sold."},
{"title": "FDA allows marketing of new device to help treat carbon monoxide poisoning", "date": "March 14, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today allowed marketing of a new device, ClearMate, intended to be used in an emergency room setting to help treat patients suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. The device uses a novel method for quickly removing carbon monoxide from the body by increasing a patient’s rate of breathing. “Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious issue, affecting thousands of people each year,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., director of the Division of Ophthalmic, and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “While the current standard treatment of administering 100 percent oxygen through a mask can be done anywhere, hyperbaric treatment, which is necessary for severe carbon monoxide poisoning, is less accessible because there are only 60 medical centers with hyperbaric units in the entire U.S. Moreover, those medical facilities are seldom in rural areas, so treatment in those areas could be delayed considerably due to transport time. Today’s marketing authorization provides patients with access to a simple, yet lifesaving device that may minimize the delay of getting vital treatment, especially in severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.” Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is extremely poisonous and can kill within minutes. In the U.S. each year, nearly 500 people die while as many as 20,000 visit emergency rooms for unintended exposure to carbon monoxide, primarily from poorly-maintained heating systems, or gas stoves or gas-powered generators used for heat or power during storms. The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide attaches to the hemoglobin in the blood exactly where oxygen is supposed to attach, reducing the amount of oxygen carried to the brain and other tissues. The standard form of treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is to have the patient breathe 100 percent oxygen through a mask. In severe cases, a hyperbaric chamber may be used, which delivers oxygen under higher than normal pressure. ClearMate—a device consisting of a gas mixer, valves, meters, breathing circuits, an oxygen reservoir, a mask and hoses—works by speeding up the elimination of carbon monoxide from the body. It delivers both 100 percent oxygen to the patient, as well as a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide, causing the patient to breathe faster. The increased breathing accelerates the rate at which the carbon monoxide leaves the patient’s body, allowing a normal amount of oxygen to attach to hemoglobin and be carried where it is needed throughout the body. In authorizing marketing of ClearMate, the FDA reviewed data from multiple clinical studies, which tested the effectiveness of the device on 100 patients. The studies demonstrated the device was effective at eliminating carbon monoxide. The combination of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ClearMate resulted in a faster elimination of carbon monoxide than treatment with 100 percent oxygen alone but was not faster than hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Patients did not experience any device-related complications in the clinical studies of efficacy or in a separate study of the device’s safety. ClearMate was reviewed under the FDA’s , a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of ClearMate to Thornhill Research, Inc.

{"title": "Statement by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new strategies to modernize clinical trials to advance precision medicine, patient protections and more efficient product development", "date": "March 14, 2019", "contents": " Modernizing clinical trials is an agency wide priority. As more diseases are being redefined based on genomic subtype, researchers have more novel targets and more opportunities to precisely modulate or even repair the basic biological drivers of illness. Precision guided medicines can demonstrate strong efficacy signals in early clinical trials, including in trials where small groups of patients are selected based on biomarkers or other criteria suggesting they’re likely to benefit. These trials can potentially allow earlier regulatory assessment of benefit and risk. When the agency can make a positive approval decision, patients can gain earlier access to important new therapeutic options. To take advantage of these innovations, the agency is also seeking new ways to modernize its approaches to accommodate these novel opportunities. The FDA isn’t alone. The advent of precision medicine is challenging the entire medical research ecosystem to develop more efficient approaches to testing and developing diagnostics and therapeutics, to harness the full potential of science to reduce the suffering, death, and disability caused by complex human illnesses. The agency is committed to developing a regulatory framework for precision medicine that generates robust evidence of product safety and efficacy as efficiently as possible, including frameworks that are more carefully suited to the kinds of precision technologies that underpin new treatments. But these opportunities can be delayed or by a clinical research enterprise that is often extraordinarily complex and expensive. Efforts to streamline medical product development based on advancing science can be frustrated by legacy business models that discourage collaboration and data sharing, and the adoption of disruptive technologies that make clinical research more effective. Without a more agile clinical research enterprise capable of testing more therapies or combinations of therapies against an expanding array of targets more efficiently and at lower total cost, important therapeutic opportunities may be delayed or discarded because we can’t afford to run trials needed to validate them. The agency has worked closely with stakeholders, including the , to identify innovative trial designs, evaluate the role of decentralized clinical trials and technologies, and help validate novel endpoints that can enable trials to generate reliable evidence needed to assess product safety and efficacy more efficiently. For instance, the FDA has pioneered trial designs that can evaluate, in parallel, different drugs compared to their respective controls or to a single common control. These trials can be updated to incorporate new scientific information, like novel biomarkers, as medical science advances. The infrastructure for these trials can last for decades. This reduces administrative costs and time associated with standing up new trial sites for each drug candidate. Unfortunately, we’ve seen a continued reluctance to adopt innovative approaches among sponsors and clinical research organizations. In some cases, the business model adopted by the clinical trial establishment just isn’t compatible with the kind of positive but disruptive changes that certain innovations can enable. We appreciate that scientific and technical complexity is a real and ongoing challenge, but industry and academia also need to invest in and leverage these approaches and develop new incentives that reward collaboration and data sharing across the clinical research enterprise. New research paradigms are needed to break down barriers between real world data and clinical research, so that evidence can be shared rapidly to improve both domains across a learning health care system. For instance, more trials can incorporate data from electronic health records, and adopt electronic informed consent, to enroll more patients in clinical trials closer to where they live and work. This can reduce barriers to clinical trial participation and accelerate researchers’ ability to ask and answer important questions. We’re committed to advancing more of these approaches through additional guidance and workshops that we’re announcing that are focused on overcoming bottlenecks to modernizing trial infrastructure. This week, we on how they can incorporate patients with more challenging health conditions into oncology clinical trials. This includes patients with brain metastases or previous malignancies; patients with organ dysfunctions, as well as adolescent and pediatric patients. Inclusion of these patients can make trials more representative of real world oncology care. Today, we’re releasing additional guidance for industry on strategies that can support the development of precision medicines, and guidance on risk-based monitoring that can be accomplished through the incorporation of more computerized systems for effective oversight. These guidances, , can help facilitate efficient development of novel innovations, while also generating the robust evidence needed to better assess product safety and efficacy. We’re also releasing a final guidance for industry, . This guidance is intended to streamline the development of pharmaceuticals used to treat patients with SDLTHDs, other than cancer, while protecting patients’ safety and avoiding unnecessary use of animals in the conduct of trials. The guidance addresses the appropriate use of non-clinical tests, both in vitro and in animal models. These approaches can facilitate streamlined development programs by improving sponsors’ understanding of drug or biologic effects on biological pathways, or potential organ toxicity, while still protecting patients’ safety and avoiding unnecessary use of animals. These methods are in accordance with the 3Rs (reduce, refine, replace) -- principles that govern the proper conduct of non-clinical research and that the FDA supports. Non-clinical evaluations include pharmacology, safety pharmacology, general toxicology, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, photosafety testing and pharmacokinetics. This guidance applies to drugs used both to treat the active disease and to prevent the recurrence of a life-threatening or debilitating event. Some examples of SDLTHDs are multicentric Castleman’s disease, aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. Enrichment is also a key strategy in the development of precision medicine. Under these approaches, treatments are targeted at groups of patients based on clinical laboratory tests, genomic or proteomic factors. Enrichment strategies rely on the selection of patients for clinical trials based on one or more characteristics intended to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the drug or biologic in selected populations. Enrichment can make it easier to detect a drug’s effect (if one is present) in a biomarker selected population – for instance, HER2 Neu+ positive breast cancer - than it would be in a larger population that hasn’t been prespecified, and where only a select population of patients would respond. These approaches can allow signal detection in smaller clinical trials, or trials of shorter duration, compared to ones that are open to “all comers.” For instance, when the high-responder population constitutes only a small fraction of all patients, such as 20 percent (a common situation in oncology settings), enrichment may generate evidence of effectiveness in a small study, including only potential responders, when showing any effect in an unselected population where only 20 percent could respond would be much more difficult. The information gleaned from these approaches can also guide clinical practice, to help doctors get the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. The same information used to select patients based on their likelihood of responding positively to a drug in a trial can be used to guide real world care. The guidance we’re issuing today, , can help expand the use of these approaches and facilitate development of innovative enrichment strategies in tandem with advancing science. Protecting human subjects in trials is another critical part of the FDA’s mission. Sponsors of clinical investigations involving human drugs, biological products, medical devices, and combinations thereof are required to provide oversight to ensure adequate protection of the rights, welfare and safety of human subjects and the quality of the data submitted to the FDA. The regulations are not specific about how sponsors are to conduct such monitoring; a range of approaches to monitoring are compatible with the regulations. Traditional on-site monitoring of each clinical site to evaluate study conduct and perform 100 percent source data verification is highly resource intensive and may account for up to a third of the total clinical trial cost. But traditional on-site monitoring that is overly focused on source data verification doesn’t guarantee data quality. Risk-based monitoring, as a component of a sponsor’s overarching quality risk-management systems and trial-specific quality by design programs, can help to provide more efficient oversight of trials, while still protecting human subjects and assuring data integrity. To support greater use of efficient risk-based monitoring, today’s guidance on provides guidance to industry on implementing risk-based monitoring of investigational studies of human drug and biological products, medical devices, or drug and device combinations. This guidance can help sponsors tailor monitoring plans to the needs of the clinical investigation, while focusing on those risks that have the greatest potential to adversely affect study quality, including critical risks to the maintenance of the rights, safety, and welfare of trial participants, and the collection and analysis of key safety and efficacy endpoint data. Risk based monitoring can be advanced using computerized algorithms that enable remote and central trial monitoring, as well as the development of advanced analytics that can be used to monitor data integrity as a trial is in process. We look forward to working with our many stakeholders to support the development of these modern approaches and make the promise of precision medicine a reality for more patients. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on forceful new actions focused on retailers, manufacturers to combat youth access to e-cigarettes as part of FDA’s Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan", "date": "March 04, 2019", "contents": " As the number of children using e-cigarettes remains at epidemic levels, our enforcement work has been one cornerstone of our efforts to protect youth from the dangers of tobacco products. In recent months our vigorous enforcement efforts as part of the agency’s have included a number of of e-cigarettes to youth at brick-and-mortar and internet storefronts, as well as steps to that can increase the appeal of these products to youth. Today, we’re taking several new actions, focused on both retailers and manufacturers, as part of our commitment to combat youth access to e-cigarettes. Because tobacco use is almost always initiated and established during adolescence, early intervention ‒ including making sure tobacco products aren’t being marketed to, sold to, or used by kids ‒ is critical. First, we sent a today to the corporate management of Walgreen Co. to request a meeting to discuss whether there is a corporate-wide issue related to their stores’ track record of violating the law by illegally selling tobacco products to kids. As we , in total, the company’s stores have racked up almost 1,800 violations across the country. They’re currently the top violator among pharmacies that sell tobacco products, with 22 percent of the more than 6,350 stores that we inspected having illegally sold tobacco products to minors. Both the rate of violations and sheer volume of violative inspections of Walgreens stores are disturbing, particularly since the company positions itself as a health-and-wellness-minded business. This cannot possibly come as a surprise to corporate leadership, which is why I want to sit down with them to discuss the important role they play, as a nationwide retailer, in curbing this epidemic. But we know that Walgreens isn’t alone. There are a number of other national, corporate-owned chains and franchise stores with disturbingly high rates of violations for illegal sales of tobacco products to minors. In total, we’ve identified 15 national retail chains, either corporate-owned or franchised, whose rates of violative inspections exceed 15 percent of their total inspected stores since the inception of the FDA’s retailer compliance check inspection program in 2010. We plan to similarly hold them accountable. We will ask them to share with us what policies they have in place and what more they can commit to do to prevent youth tobacco sales. Companies should be on notice that the FDA is considering additional enforcement avenues to address high rates of violations. Ignoring the law and then paying associated fines and penalties should not simply be viewed as a cost of doing business. The stakes are too high for our young people and our country’s decades-long fight to reduce the morbidity and mortality that accompanies tobacco product use. Retailers are on the frontlines of these efforts to reduce the health consequences of tobacco use and nicotine dependence. Walgreens, and other retail chains, should take seriously not only their legal obligations, but also the substantial public health importance of preventing tobacco product sales to minors at their stores. Today, we’re also announcing that we’ve sent seeking information about whether more than 50 products – including a variety of flavored e-cigarette products – are being illegally marketed and outside the agency’s current compliance policy. Some of these companies may be attempting to capitalize on the troubling popularity of products like JUUL among kids by illegally selling similar products and outside of the compliance policy. We also need to determine if any of these products may be counterfeit knockoffs. If tobacco products are being unlawfully marketed and sold outside the FDA’s compliance policy, we’ll take action. We simply cannot tolerate this behavior and will take additional action as needed. We also today sent our first to several companies for, among other things, selling electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products and a waterpipe tobacco product with labeling and/or advertising that failed to include the required nicotine warning statement. This is an important public health warning and it’s imperative that consumers are adequately informed of the presence of nicotine in tobacco products and understand the risks – especially kids, who research shows are mistaken or unaware of the risks and the presence of nicotine in e-cigarettes. We’re requesting these companies to submit a written response within 15 working days describing corrective actions, including dates on which the company discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products. Continued failure to comply with the law could result in enforcement action. Part of our enforcement work also includes ensuring retailers know their responsibilities under the law and the consequences for violating them. Toward that end, the FDA continues to utilize our voluntary national retailer education program called “ ,” which includes free resources designed to support retailers’ efforts to educate their staff on enforcing federal laws and regulations. We hope retailers will partner with the FDA to protect youth in their communities by knowing the law and making use of tools that make it easier to prevent underage sales. The FDA has also developed a retailer education online platform to provide state and territorial officials with educational tools and information on retailer regulations. The program also facilitates peer-to-peer sharing, and fosters conversations around promising practices, lessons learned, and program feedback. Our boots-on-the-ground presence across the country is also a critical part of our work to ensure retailers aren’t selling tobacco products to minors. This past fall, we marked a historic milestone of conducting a total of one million tobacco retailer inspections since the program began in 2010. This work has resulted in more than 81,570 warning letters to retailers for violating the law as well as the issuance of more than 19,800 civil money penalties and about 145 no-tobacco-sale orders for repeated violations. This major achievement couldn’t have been done without the help of our state partners who are often the ones doing our undercover compliance checks to make sure these products aren’t being sold to kids. That’s why today we sent letters to a number of governors across the country thanking them for their work to support our efforts that led to this significant accomplishment and reminding them we still have work to do to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids. We’re confronting a deeply troubling public health epidemic with youth e-cigarette use that’s threatening the progress we’ve made in reducing youth tobacco use. The sharp rise in the number of teens using e-cigarettes illustrates the need to work together with diverse stakeholders and remain vigilant in our shared effort to reverse these trends. We all share the important responsibility of keeping harmful and addictive tobacco products out of the hands of kids. And we realize change can also happen at the grassroots level, which is why we are also working on a plan to go into local communities to highlight areas of the country that have high rates of violations, underscore the importance of not selling tobacco products to minors and encourage concerned parents and others to to the FDA. We are also exploring ways that we might partner with state attorneys general to help combat youth e-cigarette use in their states. We’ll continue vigorous enforcement activities, with a sustained campaign to monitor, penalize and help prevent e-cigarette sales to minors in retail locations, including manufacturers’ internet storefronts, as well as take additional steps to tackle other concerns related to the youth access and appeal of these products. The FDA is also exploring additional enforcement avenues to target violative sales and marketing practices by manufacturers and retailers. Soon we’ll be providing further information on our announced in November to address youth access to flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and cigars. We’re aware that some retailers and manufacturers have taken some initial positive steps aimed at reducing youth access to e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. While we recognize those who have taken some positive steps to confront this epidemic, we also know there’s more for them to do and that bad actors continue to put youth at risk despite knowing the law and for their own financial gain. As illustrated by today’s actions, we’re using our compliance and enforcement tools as part of our work to combat the epidemic level of youth e-cigarette use we’re currently experiencing. But our work is not done. We also have studies underway, including investigations that FDA commissioned, to look at the potential for direct effects of harm from e-cigarettes on the lungs and other health factors. This includes the potential for products to cause changes that could be a precursor to cancer. While we believe that e-cigarettes offer a potentially safer alternative to combustible tobacco for currently addicted adult smokers who completely switch to these products, these products are not without risks. This is one reason why we strongly believe that no child should be using an e-cigarette or any other tobacco product. We’ll also be sharing additional planned policy changes and actions soon. I still believe that e-cigarettes present an important opportunity for currently addicted adult smokers to transition off combustible products and onto nicotine delivery products that may not have the same level of risks associated with them. But if these trends of youth e-cigarette use persist, we’ll be forced to consider regulatory steps that could constrain or even foreclose some of the opportunities for currently addicted adult smokers to have the same level of access to these products in order to protect youth. Our opportunity to preserve these opportunities for adults for the long run means that retailers and manufacturers need to take their responsibilities to keep these products out of the hands of kids seriously and ensure these products don’t become a gateway to hooking an entire generation of children on tobacco and nicotine. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDA’s steps on naming of biological medicines to balance competition and safety for patients receiving these products  ", "date": "March 07, 2019", "contents": " We’re at a critical point for the future of biosimilars in the U.S. Millions of American patients stand to benefit from increased utilization of these lower-cost, high-quality products. At the FDA, we’re committed to helping patients realize the public health benefits of a robust, competitive market for biosimilars. Since the biosimilar pathway was established in 2010, there’s been debate about how biological products should be named, and whether a unique identifier such as a distinguishing suffix should be added to the proper (i.e., non-proprietary) names of biological products to help ensure strong pharmacovigilance. Some have argued that the addition of a distinguishing suffix could serve as a barrier to the use of biosimilar products and brisk competition. We strongly believe in the ability of biosimilars to promote competition, lower prices and foster greater access. And we’re fully committed to the suite of announced and upcoming policies to help advance the goal of a robust, high-quality, competitive market for biosimilar products. But I do not believe that the naming convention should be used to advance these goals if it could come at the expense of the ability to ensure patient safety. Nor do I believe the inclusion of a suffix will frustrate the broader aim of inspiring strong biosimilar competition. In January 2017, the FDA published a guidance document in which we sought to balance these concerns by using a distinguishing suffix to the proper names of biological products, including not just biosimilars, but originator products as well. By applying this policy to originator and biosimilar products alike, the FDA sought to advance the goal of patient safety – which the suffixes promote – without creating a misimpression that products with such suffixes are somehow inferior to those without. In addition, the FDA announced in that guidance that the agency was considering the process to retrospectively change the names of biological products already on the market, to begin adding distinguishable suffixes. Today we’re announcing an important update to our policy with respect to the naming convention. We are releasing an that explains that: The FDA no longer intends to modify the proper names of biological products that have already been licensed or approved under the Public Health Service Act without an FDA-designated suffix in their proper names. The FDA does not intend to apply the naming convention to the proper names of transition biological products. Going forward, for interchangeable biosimilars, the FDA intends to designate a proper name that is a combination of the core name and a distinguishing suffix that is devoid of meaning and composed of four lowercase letters. This framework will help secure pharmacovigilance so that the FDA can effectively monitor all biological products in the post market – originators and biosimilars – and promote patient safety. To aid in adverse event report tracking, originator, biosimilar and interchangeable products will have nonproprietary names that are distinct from each other. Additionally, under this updated policy, any product that is first licensed as a biosimilar and later determined to be interchangeable will keep its nonproprietary name after receiving a determination of interchangeability. The naming policy will provide consistency among biologics and will help ensure health care providers and patients have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of any biological product on the market. To achieve these goals, the unique four-letter suffix that’s incorporated as part of a biological product’s nonproprietary name is being applied to originator products going forward, as well as to any biosimilar and interchangeable products, so they can be appropriately distinguished from one another at the pharmacy level. Because biologics are generally complex and typically impossible to replicate in the way small-compound drugs can be, and even though biosimilars have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product, these unique suffixes are a critical component of the FDA’s ability to track adverse events to a specific biological product and manufacturer so that appropriate action can be taken when needed to protect patients. The naming convention is meant, first and foremost, to ensure patient safety by helping providers and patients properly identify products where it’s important to be able to distinguish between different medicines and different versions of similar or interchangeable products. As it stands, the proper names of all 17 approved biosimilars have been approved with the four-letter suffixes, as have the proper names of 27 originator biological products. As the FDA continues to apply this policy, we expect that a steadily increasing proportion of licensed biological products, including originator products, will have nonproprietary names that include four-letter suffixes. Of the biological products within the scope of the policy, only those originator products licensed prior to the implementation of the policy will lack a suffix. After the FDA issued its 2017 guidance on biologics naming, we heard the concerns from stakeholders that one aspect of the policy – changing the names of older biologics to add suffixes – would impose substantial costs on the health care system and had the potential to create confusion that could increase risks to patients as drug names don’t often change after drugs go to market. After careful consideration, the FDA has determined that the crucial public health goals of the naming policy could still be accomplished by applying the naming convention to newly licensed biological products, while avoiding the negative consequences raised by extending the naming convention to previously licensed products. To go back and change the names of these approved products would be a costly enterprise to the health care system; if those costs were to be passed on to patients, that impact would run directly counter to the goals of access and affordability that underlie the biosimilars program. Moreover, requiring retrospective names changes would not help advance the interest of effective pharmacovigilance since these products are already generally distinguishable by their proper names. So, the FDA is not requiring these legacy names to be changed. Ultimately, our policy on naming is meant to help ensure the safety of patients receiving biological products. We expect that by continuing to apply suffixes to new originator, related, biosimilar and interchangeable products that we will help meet our objective of safe use and pharmacovigilance. We’re also issuing for FDA staff to ensure consistency and provide transparency of the review process for suffixes for applicable products. In advancing consistency in the convention for naming all newly licensed biologicals – be it originator, biosimilar or interchangeable products – we aim to mitigate the risk of false perceptions from health care providers and patients that there’s a difference in the relative safety and effectiveness of these biological products based on their name. We expect that as time goes on, and more biological products are introduced to the market with distinguishable suffixes, patients and providers increasingly will understand that the suffixes reflect a consistent naming convention and are not an indicator of product quality. What’s important to remember is that biosimilars have been proven to be highly similar and have no clinically meaningful differences, and the FDA continues to engage in efforts to promote this understanding. The FDA has developed its naming policy with a view to the , when the biosimilar and interchangeable pathway will open to additional products, such as insulin. As we look to the future, and the transition draws nearer, the agency will continue to take new steps to make the biosimilar development process more efficient and transparent. We continue working to implement the statutory transition provisions – such as transitioning certain products, including insulin, to the Public Health Service Act – in a way that minimizes burden, helps ensure stability for patients using currently marketed products, and advances the development of biosimilar and interchangeable products, opening originator biologics up to competition from biosimilars. To advance all of these complementary goals, we are taking many additional steps to promote competition and access. In July 2018, we announced the to help advance the agency’s implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. A key part of the plan is to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process. The plan also seeks to increase scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar development community. In , the agency announced a suite of new policy actions advancing this plan, including new guidance describing the agency’s approach to the statutory transition of approved applications for biological products currently regulated under NDAs to being regulated under BLAs on March 23, 2020. This important milestone will enable, for the first time, products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with these transitioned biological products, like insulin, to come to market. As we move closer to the 2020 transition, we know that the FDA’s biologics naming policy is a component of broader efforts to help facilitate robust competition among biologics. Our primary goal with respect to the naming convention is to matters of patient safety. But, we’re cognizant of – and responsive to – how these decisions impact competition and we shaped our policy with these considerations also in mind. Today’s updated draft guidance sets a clear path for the nonproprietary naming of interchangeable biosimilars. The feedback the agency previously received as part of the comment period for the final 2017 guidance raised important concerns on the part of industry. With today’s announcement, we hope to receive additional public input. Based on the comments received for today’s draft guidance, we intend to ultimately issue a revised, final version of the 2017 Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products guidance that amends the relevant sections necessary to incorporate input we receive through this comment period. Finally, as part of today’s update, we are announcing that the agency is continuing to carefully consider the application of the naming convention to vaccines. In view of the existing framework for ensuring safety reporting and monitoring for vaccines, the agency is carefully considering whether the information that’s already available to us through identification systems associated with the administration of vaccines is sufficiently robust for ensuring pharmacovigilance such that we may not need distinguishable proper names with suffixes for vaccines.

FSIS and FDA released a formal agreement to address the regulatory oversight of human food produced using this new technology. The formal agreement describes the oversight roles and responsibilities for both agencies and how the agencies will collaborate to regulate the development and entry of these products into commerce. This shared regulatory approach will ensure that cell-cultured products derived from the cell lines of livestock and poultry are produced safely and are accurately labeled. “Consumers trust the USDA mark of inspection to ensure safe, wholesome and accurately labeled products,” said USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety Mindy Brashears. “We look forward to continued collaboration with FDA and our stakeholders to safely regulate these new products and ensure parity in labeling.” “We recognize that our stakeholders want clarity on how we will move forward with a regulatory regime to ensure the safety and proper labeling of these cell-cultured human food products while continuing to encourage innovation,” said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response. “Collaboration between USDA and FDA will allow us to draw upon the unique expertise of each agency in addressing the many important technical and regulatory considerations that can arise with the development of animal cell-cultured food products for human consumption.” Under the formal agreement, the agencies agree upon a joint regulatory framework wherein FDA oversees cell collection, cell banks, and cell growth and differentiation. A transition from FDA to FSIS oversight will occur during the cell harvest stage. FSIS will oversee the production and labeling of human food products derived from the cells of livestock and poultry. On Oct. 23-24, 2018, FSIS and FDA held a joint public meeting to discuss the use of cell culture technology to develop products derived from livestock and poultry. The public meeting focused on the potential hazards, oversight considerations, and labeling of cell cultured food products derived from livestock and poultry.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. as prepared for oral testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations", "date": "February 27, 2019", "contents": " Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Fortenberry, and members of the subcommittee. I want to thank you today on behalf of the FDA for your continued support of our public health mission. We’re witness to a period of historic scientific advance. The opportunities we have, across our entire portfolio, to advance health and wellbeing, far exceed any comparable period of rapid technological change. Simply put, we’re in a period of unparalleled medical progress. Your support is helping us seize these opportunities to improve the lives of Americans. The FDA’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget includes one of the most substantial increases for the FDA in recent years. The initiatives that Congress supported will help uncover new treatment options for patients suffering from debilitating conditions, improve competition to help lower drug costs and improve patient access to medicines, and advance development of treatments for rare diseases. The new funding will also help us better secure consumer safety by improving our oversight of food products; and modernizing our approach to medical product safety and manufacturing. These are just some of the opportunities enabled by the new funding that Congress provided to the agency. The same rapid pace of science requires us to also modernize our own policies, to make sure we can fully leverage these opportunities.  To complement the support, you’ve given us to secure these scientific advances, we’re undertaking one the most significant modernization effort in decades for our Office of New Drugs. This new effort encompasses steps to update our approach to drug review across every stage in the life cycle of a new innovation, from the time an investigator first asks the FDA for permission to begin the clinical testing of a new drug to how we continue to assess the safety and effectiveness of new medicines after they’re approved by the agency. I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about some elements of this undertaking, and how I believe our policy efforts will extend the opportunities from the resources you’ve provided us. These steps begin at the outset of the new drug development process, when a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) seeking permission from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to patients for the first time. Beginning in the next few months, our Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) will adopt new standard templates for our 30-day IND safety reviews and protocol reviews. This will better integrate the work of clinical and scientific reviewers, improve the consistency of the IND review process, reduce duplicative paperwork, provide greater efficiency and predictability to product developers, and enable the FDA to be more effective and strategic in premarket safety discussions with sponsors during its review of these INDs. By using standardized templates for the submission and review of these INDs, we believe the consistency will help investigators more efficiently advance new products into development, while making sure that the FDA has the information it needs to help safeguard patients. As part of our pursuit of more standardized methods for the assessment of information across all aspects of the drug review process – and to improve the rigor and predictability of these methods – we’re also extending these same approaches to how we assess product safety. We’re launching a “safety signal tracker” to serve as a repository of important potential safety issues throughout a drug’s lifecycle, from early in IND development through application review and into the post-market setting. This consolidates information about safety concerns during drug development in a single location. In this way, safety questions can be more consistently tracked, annotated, and continuously evaluated through every stage in the life cycle of a new medical product. Reviewers don’t need to hunt for information across multiple databases and documents. All team members share a common view of key information. This helps cement a more systematic approach to how we continue to evaluate certain safety questions throughout the new drug or biological product application review and could measurably improve the drug development process. As part of this process, the Office of New Drugs has also started conducting meetings early in the drug review cycle to scope-out potential and known safety issues. This helps make sure potential safety questions can be more thoroughly addressed at mid-review-cycle meetings. This, in turn, facilitates more proactive planning to evaluate or mitigate known or perceived risks. Finally, we’re making the process more effective by adding clinical data scientists to our new drug and biological product safety review process, and incorporating standard tables and figures supporting the team’s analysis of safety data. Once again, the aim is to make the entire process more structured and predictable. This same commitment to using modern tools and policies to achieve a more structured approach to drug development extends into our review of clinical evidence in new drug applications. For the first time in more than 20 years, we’re undertaking the first update of our guidance outlining how we assess the clinical effectiveness for drugs. A lot has changed since we first recommended in guidance in 1998 how investigators should conduct trials to support a drug’s effectiveness. Our approval standard remains unchanged. But the science and data that we evaluate as part of drug review, and the diseases that are more often being targeted by new medicines, has changed a lot. We have much more opportunity to use a broader array of data as confirmatory evidence to help support product review. This includes real world evidence and real world data. At the same time more, new medicines target rare diseases, where the approaches to the design of clinical trials are carefully tailored to the kinds of clinical circumstances under which new drugs are being studied. Our new guidance on evidence for establishing clinical effectiveness seeks to accommodate these changes. It describes many of the more modern approaches we’ve been recommending when it comes to the design of trials and the generation of evidence to support product review. These same general approaches extend to our efforts to modernize how we assess post-market drug safety. As part of the New Drugs Regulatory Program Modernization, we’ve launched a new effort to analyze more safety data more efficiently across the entire drug lifecycle, including in the post-market setting.  We’re implementing changes to capture more types of safety data, enhance our data analytics, and grow Sentinel’s ability to detect potential new safety problems. We’ll be working to link claims data in Sentinel to electronic health records, to improve our ability to conduct active surveillance and use real world data to improve patient outcomes.  We’ll be using the new resources as part of our 2019 budget to help advance these efforts. By linking information from electronic health records to the data we have on medical claims through our existing Sentinel system, we’ll be able to get a much more complete picture of potential safety issues post-approval and to advance the use of real world data to study drug effectiveness. As another part of these efforts, I’m pleased to announce that the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System for drugs will be expanded to cover more types of safety data. For the first time, this system will also include pre-market drug safety data. Specifically, FAERS will include IND safety reports, which are information on serious, unexpected adverse reactions in clinical trials. It will also include product quality defect reports, and generic bioequivalence trial safety reports. These reports are now stored and reviewed individually. Entering them into FAERS and enhancing our analytics will make it easier to see the big picture of potential safety issues related to a drug across its lifecycle. It will also make this information more accessible to the public. The support of this Committee is key to these efforts. And it’s a key to our goal to help leverage the tools of science and innovation to advance the public health. We have new and better opportunities to help improve the expectation every patient should have that the medical products they use have been more fully evaluated for their safety. And we have new and better methods for more efficiently confirming clinical evidence of benefit for drugs targeted to unmet medical needs. These methods can help reduce the cost of drug development, hopefully translating into more affordable medicines. They can advance more products to patients and make the entire process safer and more efficient. We have the tools to unlock new opportunities to address disease and disability. I look forward to continuing to work with you on these efforts and answering your questions today.

{"title": "FDA statement on FDA’s modern approach to advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing", "date": "February 26, 2019", "contents": " One of today’s most important tools for modernizing the pharmaceutical industry is a process known as continuous manufacturing (CM). This approach transforms the traditional, step-wise manufacturing processes into a single system that’s based on modern process monitoring and controls. It enables a steady output of finished drug products as raw materials are continuously added to the closed system. Today, we’re taking new steps to help advance the adoption of these manufacturing innovations. The closed and continuous nature of these CM systems means that the process is easier to control than the decades-old, traditional “batch” manufacturing. Under that traditional approach, the finished drug product is made using a long series of discrete steps that involve many stops and starts. Each step in this traditional staggered manufacturing process introduces a degree of complexity and uncertainty. CM helps to ensure consistently-made products, allows manufacturers to more easily scale their manufacturing operations to meet demand, and can help reduce drug shortages by minimizing operational stops and starts. CM systems also require smaller footprints to operate. The high tech and small footprint attributes of these systems promote localized manufacturing, helping to shorten the drug supply chain. Furthermore, these continuous processes are much more efficient. This may help manufacturers reduce costs of production in the long run. This efficiency could eventually be captured for consumers in the form of lower drug prices. This area is still new and developing. Harnessing the full potential of these innovations will require us to invest time and resources in developing scientific standards and policy and supporting implementation. This is why we’ve charged the FDA’s to help early adopters of CM (and other advanced manufacturing technologies) surface and resolve implementation challenges and navigate the application review process for products made with these modern methods. We’re also taking additional steps to help facilitate broader adoption of CM by providing guidance and information to interested companies, whether brand name or generic drug manufacturers. We’re beginning to see encouraging progress. Less than four years ago, there was only one approved product manufactured using CM processes. Today, there are four companies manufacturing five approved products using CM, treating diseases like cystic fibrosis, HIV-1 infections, breast cancer and leukemia. About 20 additional companies -- both brand and generic -- have engaged the FDA in their efforts to develop and implement CM processes. We’ve talked about the CM can offer compared to traditional batch manufacturing in terms of reliability and efficiency of production. To advance these goals, we’ve provided grants to fund and we are conducting internal laboratory investigations to study CM and other technologies. However, we understand that some companies still have questions and concerns they need to address before making the changeover. For one, the cost of new equipment is a key concern. The FDA can help address these issues by providing clear guidance on what process and control strategy designs (including equipment) are needed to meet regulatory considerations and how a CM platform technology can be used to manufacture multiple products, so that product developers can have more certainty about the capital investments they need to make. This can provide sponsors with more assurance about the costs of adopting these new methods and the payoffs they can anticipate from making these investments. Since processes and facilities for CM differ from traditional operations, some companies have questions about how using this new technology will impact the way the FDA and other regulators assess new drug applications when the products are being produced using these methods, and how regulators will approach facility inspections. It’s incumbent on the FDA to ensure that companies clearly understand our regulatory approach so they’re confident in making this investment. We’ve seen early adopters find innovative solutions to overcoming challenges in developing their CM facilities. For example, companies have designed and built modular and miniature CM equipment in their facilities. This design not only allowed the company to run their CM operations in a smaller physical footprint, but also allowed the company to transfer identical units to different sites, and therefore help to start their CM operations more quickly in different locations. To continue to advance greater predictability and quality around the adoption of these systems, today the FDA is to help further support the development and implementation of CM for brand, generic, and over-the-counter drugs. This draft guidance will clarify the FDA’s current thinking regarding innovative CM approaches and can help resolve potential issues some companies have as they consider implementation, such as concerns that use of new CM technology might impact the time FDA takes to assess applications for new products and switching from a batch to CM process for existing products. The draft guidance also supports a global effort with other regulatory authorities to encourage implementation of CM. The FDA also proposed development of a guidance on CM to the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The ICH assembly accepted the FDA’s proposal and set a goal of finalizing the guidance by 2021. This harmonized guidance will help advance the brand and generic drug industries ability to obtain approvals for products manufactured using CM processes in multiple regions. We’ve also taken other steps to advance the adoption of these technologies, including a request for funding to help We’re encouraged to see a growing number of companies embracing CM. It’s a key step towards promoting drug quality and improving the efficiency of pharmaceutical manufacturing. We’ve worked hard to help industry develop the tools to start advancing these goals. The FDA is committed to helping more companies advance these CM platforms owing to the public health benefits of these more modern approaches. We support the early adopters that are embracing this innovative technology and we look forward to working with other interested companies.

{"title": "FDA provides update on its ongoing investigation into ARB drug products; reports on finding of a new nitrosamine impurity in certain lots of losartan and product recall", "date": "March 01, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is updating the public on the agency’s ongoing investigation surrounding the recent voluntary recalls of multiple generic angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) drug products used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Hetero Labs Ltd. in India has announced a recall (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg). The recalled losartan potassium tablets made by Hetero Labs and distributed by Camber Pharmaceuticals contain the impurity, N-Nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA). The impurity is a known animal and potential human carcinogen. This is the first ARB recall resulting from the presence of NMBA, which is the third type of nitrosamine impurity detected in ARB medicines. Recent testing of these recalled lots of losartan potassium tablets showed NMBA levels higher than the . The FDA’s that the nitrosamines found in ARBs may be generated when specific chemicals and reaction conditions are present in the manufacturing process of the drug’s API, and may also result from the reuse of materials, such as solvents. “We are deeply concerned about the presence of a third nitrosamine impurity in certain ARB medications, but it’s important to underscore that, based on the FDA’s initial evaluation, the increased risk of cancer to patients with NMBA exposure appears to be the same for NDMA exposure but less than the risk from NDEA exposure. That said, any presence of such impurities in drug products is not acceptable. Over the past few months, the FDA has conducted a major investigation and has worked with drug companies to address the presence of impurities in these products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Our ongoing effort has determined that the impurities may be generated by specific chemical reactions in the manufacturing process of the drug’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. FDA scientists have developed novel and sophisticated testing methods specifically designed to detect and measure N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) impurities in ARB medicines. Because of the potential for discovering other nitrosamine impurities, we are conducting an extensive organic chemistry analysis to develop novel testing methods to detect additional nitrosamine impurities, including NMBA. We’re continuing to share these testing methods with international regulators, industry and the public to help manufacturers and other regulators evaluate these products for any potential nitrosamine impurity. We are making important strides at understanding how these impurities form and we are continuing to examine if nitrosamine impurities may also arise during the manufacture of other ARB drug products. The FDA is committed to implementing measures to prevent the formation of these impurities during drug manufacturing processes in the future.” Hetero Labs identified NMBA in lots of losartan potassium during recent testing. NMBA has not been found in previously recalled ARB products; however, the FDA is continuing its investigation. Previously, two other nitrosamine impurities, NDMA and NDEA, were found in drug products containing the active pharmaceutical ingredients valsartan, losartan and irbesartan and those products containing nitrosamines above the interim acceptable limits were recalled. Recent FDA analyses of NDMA and NDEA in recalled valsartan found that overall, the risk to individual patients is very low, although this doesn’t diminish the significance of this issue or the FDA’s concerns. The agency continues to evaluate the risks nitrosamines pose to patients. The FDA and drug manufacturers continue to test all ARBs for nitrosamine impurities. If NDEA, NDMA, NMBA, or other nitrosamine impurities are found in products at levels above the interim acceptable intake limits, the FDA will work with companies to swiftly remove affected products from the market. The FDA will continue to update the as more information becomes available from ongoing testing. If patients take an ARB drug product, they should check the list periodically, as information may change. The FDA reminds patients taking an ARB medication from a recalled lot to continue taking their medicine until their doctor or pharmacist provides a replacement or a different treatment option. Any patient taking an ARB from a recalled lot who has not yet spoken to their pharmacist or doctor should do so promptly. Not all ARBs contain nitrosamine impurities.

{"title": "FDA warns CanaRx for selling unapproved, misbranded and unsafe imported drugs to unsuspecting Americans", "date": "February 28, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration posted a for facilitating the distribution of unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs to U.S. consumers. These drugs are potentially dangerous to U.S. consumers. “The FDA’s regulation and oversight of the drug approval process and distribution protects consumers by requiring rigorous scientific standards, labeling review for accuracy and completeness, and helping to ensure that counterfeit and unsafe drugs do not penetrate the U.S. drug supply, among other things. When companies sidestep important drug safety measures and put patient health at risk by providing unapproved drugs that have been substituted for FDA-approved prescription drugs, it’s the agency’s responsibility to step in to protect the patients,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “If an American consumer goes to Canada and walks into a brick-and-mortar Canadian pharmacy and buys a medicine, they’re getting a high-quality drug because of Canada’s first-class drug regulatory process. When a consumer goes online to buy medicines purportedly from Canada, they may get a medicine sourced from elsewhere that could be counterfeit, expired or misbranded. While operations or illegal online pharmacies may state on their websites that its medicines are coming from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc., this is not necessarily always the case. Such operations and illegal online pharmacies take advantage of unsuspecting Americans by purporting to distribute safe and effective imported drugs, at least some of which are instead expired, mislabeled, subject to recalls or potentially counterfeit and that are provided outside of the closed American distribution system meant to protect patient safety. Such schemes are particularly egregious, as they deceive patients and their employers who provide prescription drug coverage. Operations like CanaRx use their names to imply that patients are receiving medicines approved in Canada, when it’s likely that patients are receiving medicines from other countries, and which may be sub-potent, super-potent or counterfeit. Importantly, they’re also distributing drugs for which the FDA-approved versions are subject to additional safety requirements, such as special handling or specific safety requirements that apply when drugs are administered to patients (called REMS programs) because the risks associated with the medicines are serious and need to be carefully managed in order to protect patients. These risk mitigation programs are a legal requirement and are in place for important safety reasons. Sidestepping them is unacceptable and puts the safety of patients in great jeopardy. We’re also troubled by robust marketing tactics, like those of CanaRx, which are used to give false credence to their operation. To protect patients from these unapproved drugs, we urge employers and any enrolled employees not to use any medicines from CanaRx. The FDA will pursue additional enforcement actions as needed.” The warning letter is the result of a lengthy review of the company’s violative practices. The letter expresses the FDA’s concerns with the scheme CanaRx uses to contract with public and private entities to provide prescription drug coverage to their employees. In the scheme, CanaRx facilitates foreign physicians rewriting the employee’s U.S. prescription, and then supplies the employee with unapproved versions of FDA-approved drugs purportedly sourced from Canada, the United Kingdom or Australia that are represented to have undergone review from those countries’ drug regulatory systems. This is particularly troublesome, as employees are likely inclined to trust that they will receive safe and effective drugs through their employer’s “insurance” plan and may not question their legitimacy. The drugs distributed by CanaRx may have different dosage strengths or be manufactured by companies different than the FDA-approved drug. They may be from different regions and they may be counterfeit. The substitution of FDA-approved prescription drugs with unapproved versions that may have substantially different risk profiles can pose serious health risks to consumers, especially in vulnerable patient populations that suffer from serious conditions such as HIV, cancer or hepatitis. The closed drug distribution system in the U.S. provides critical assurances to patients. Congress has taken steps in recent years to give the FDA additional authorities to ensure the integrity of the U.S. drug distribution system under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Unapproved, imported drugs do not have the same assurance of safety, efficacy and quality as drugs subject to FDA oversight and may be sub-potent, super-potent or counterfeit. CanaRx’s substitution for prescribed FDA-approved drugs can have safety consequences for patients because, for example, their condition may not improve and the patient’s health care provider may not know that this may be attributed to an unapproved drug. This can also cause potentially dangerous drug interactions with the patient’s other medications. In addition, sourcing drugs from uninspected, unregulated or unknown supply chains can result in serious health consequences, especially in vulnerable patient populations, who may receive drugs that are adulterated, or are not shipped or stored properly. CanaRx also offers certain drugs on its medication lists for which the FDA-approved version is subject to a REMS program and is indicated to treat serious conditions such as HIV, cancer or hepatitis. For example, the REMS for Tracleer, a medicine used to treat certain types of pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the vessels of the lungs, restricts distribution of the drug to only health care providers who comply with the requirements of the REMS, in order to minimize the risk of fetal exposure and serious birth defects in female patients taking Tracleer and the risk of liver damage in patients. No such safe-guards are in place for the “Tracleer” distributed by CanaRxv. In some instances, the FDA-approved versions of several drugs listed on CanaRx’s medication lists have been subject to one or more recalls in the U.S. The FDA has established processes to ensure the recall of unsafe, substandard and poor-quality drugs within the legitimate U.S. drug supply chain, but no such official safeguards exist for unapproved drugs illegally distributed in the U.S. from foreign sources. Many of the foreign versions of FDA-approved drugs substituted by CanaRx are likely to have been subject to foreign recalls not adequately carried out in the U.S., presenting unacceptable risks of harm to U.S. consumers. The warning letter also lists more than 150 websites affiliated with CanaRx, which is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. The warning letter requests that CanaRx respond within 10 working days, with details of how the violations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Any violations not corrected in the warning letter could lead to enforcement action. The FDA is committed to taking steps to promote product competition and the availability of safe and effective generic alternatives to branded medicines as part of a comprehensive effort to improve access to prescription drugs and help lower costs. Many patients have a difficult time affording the medicines that they need to improve or maintain their health. In recent years, the agency has that have expanded competition and access. The agency remains committed to taking additional steps this year to help consumers get access to the safe and effective, affordable medications that they need. Consumers who have concerns about any medicine they are taking supplied through CanaRx should talk with their health care provider before stopping or making other changes in their treatment. Health care providers and consumers should report any adverse events related to drugs provided by CanaRx to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting program.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on additional steps by the agency to support the development of safe and effective novel nicotine replacement therapies to help smokers quit cigarettes", "date": "February 21, 2019", "contents": " More than 54 years after the landmark Surgeon General’s report on smoking and health, tobacco use – primarily cigarette smoking – remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S., responsible for 480,000 premature deaths each year. Why? Because cigarettes are incredibly addictive. Most adult smokers want to quit, and nearly half try to do so every year. But nicotine, which a cigarette efficiently delivers through the lungs and to the brain in less than 10 seconds, draws many people back despite their desire to stop. While nicotine keeps smokers addicted, it’s the smoke and the 7,000 chemicals contained in it that causes the disease and death. That’s why a key element of our comprehensive plan to significantly reduce tobacco-related disease and death is recognizing that nicotine, while highly addictive, is delivered through products along a continuum of risk with combustible cigarettes at one end, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products at the other. In particular, NRT products, which are designed to safely reduce withdrawal symptoms, including the nicotine craving associated with quitting smoking, are generally considered to double the likelihood of a successful quit attempt. Quitting smoking can lower a person’s chances of having lung disease, heart disease or getting certain types of cancer. Most existing NRTs such as gums, patches and lozenges have been approved for more than 30 years. They have played an important role in providing adults with tools to help quit smoking, in a manner that doesn’t require cutting themselves off immediately and entirely from nicotine. Now, we have an opportunity to build on these NRTs, with novel products that may provide an opportunity to save even more lives by empowering adults to safely and effectively quit smoking. Novel products with different characteristics or routes of nicotine delivery have the potential to offer additional opportunities for health-concerned smokers interested in quitting. This could also include products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems like electronic cigarettes, but which would need to be proven safe and effective for smoking cessation and regulated as a drug product. This would allow them to be marketed as a prescription or over-the-counter drug products with medical claims for smoking cessation or related indications – ultimately reducing the likelihood of someone continuing to suffer the clinical consequences of smoking. This is different from our regulation of e-cigarettes as tobacco products. As part of our commitment to increasing access and use of FDA-approved medicinal nicotine products, we established the in September 2017. Since then, the committee has been focused on creating a more flexible framework that enables the development of safe and effective product innovations that have the potential to help smokers quit combustible cigarettes and improve their health. This included holding a examining the types of safety and efficacy studies we suggest be conducted and the way these products are used and labeled and developing guidance to facilitate the development of these products. Building on these efforts to encourage innovation of drug products to help more smokers quit cigarettes, today, we’re releasing the second of two draft guidances aimed at supporting the development of novel nicotine replacement therapies that could be sold as new FDA-approved drugs, similar to current prescription and over-the-counter NRT drug products. The first guidance released in August 2018, “ ,” focused on data recommended to evaluate potential toxicities associated with orally inhaled nicotine-containing drug products (such as e-cigarettes) to inform the FDA’s assessment of a product’s benefits and risks. That draft guidance recognizes that a great deal of toxicity information is available for nicotine, but such information may not be available for other compounds like flavorings and heat-generated chemicals contained in e-liquids and delivered by these products. Because these products can be used for six months or more over the course of a lifetime, it’s important to understand the risks to humans from these exposures, including developmental and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. The draft guidance issued today, “ ,” helps lay out a framework for new potential clinically relevant outcomes for smoking cessation products, such as reducing the chance of a smoker going back to using cigarettes long term. This draft guidance takes into consideration the input received at the public hearing in January 2018 and is intended to serve as a focus for continued discussions among the FDA, pharmaceutical sponsors, the cessation research community, and the public. The aim of the guidance is to describe new endpoints that are meaningful to helping currently addicted adult smokers, and that can promote innovation in NRT by outlining a broader set of criteria that can serve as the basis for new approvals. The current labeling for NRT products recommends that the smoker establish a “quit day” and stop smoking cigarettes that day. While this can work for highly motivated smokers, many such quit attempts fail and result in a return to smoking. However, other treatment regimens, such as pre-treatment before quit day, quitting by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked (reduce-to-quit), or using two NRT drug products together, can be explored to help cigarette smokers quit. While NRT drug products to date have been developed for smoking cessation, the draft guidance, when finalized, will outline ways sponsors may develop products to reduce the risk of relapse. Additionally, it will outline ways sponsors may also be able to support including additional information in labeling, such as a reduction of urge to smoke and relief of cue-induced craving in former smokers, or relief of withdrawal symptoms not associated with a cessation attempt. As we look toward the future and the possibility of a world where combustible cigarettes could no longer create or sustain addiction, these guidances are part of comprehensive steps to pave the way for new, safe and effective products that can help currently addicted smokers quit the deadliest form of nicotine delivery. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new policy to improve access and foster price competition for drugs that face inadequate generic competition", "date": "February 15, 2019", "contents": " In too many cases, branded drugs that are no longer protected by patents or other exclusivities do not face expected competition. In fact, there are several hundred of such branded drugs that do not have any generic competition. Instances like these may keep prices high and ultimately hurt American patients. We’ve been taking new policy steps at the FDA to support downward pressure on drug prices by helping to clear a path for more efficient generic development. In doing so, we know that various factors may influence a manufacturer’s decision to develop and market a generic drug. For example, some drugs may not attract a high level of interest if there is a limited market for them. We also know that some drugs may be less desirable to genericize because they are complex drugs, which are more difficult to copy. We’re working to reduce barriers to generic development and to lower the cost of generic entry so that more of the generic medicines that the FDA approves are launched and reach patients. Over the next year, the FDA will advance additional policies to promote generic competition including for complex drugs. Among other steps, we intend to issue additional guidance documents for developing specific complex generic medicines, as well as address categories of complex drugs that are hard to copy because of their complex formulation or mode of delivery. This will include the publication of a series of guidances to address regulatory and scientific challenges that make it generally more difficult to develop complex generics. As part of this, we intend to issue draft guidance with recommendations on establishing active ingredient sameness. In addition, we’ll advance the development of new analytical tools and in vitro tests to provide additional accurate, sensitive and reproducible tools to support approval of complex generic drugs. Better tools for proving sameness can open up more complex drugs to generic competition. Today, the FDA is taking another step to encourage generic entry for drugs that face inadequate competition by laying out new, efficient guidelines for the use of a novel pathway that provides incentives for developing generic versions of drugs that currently face little or no competition. This new pathway for Competitive Generic Therapies (CGTs) is a significant advancement in generic drug competition. Designation of a drug as a CGT can be granted to a company submitting an application for their generic drug when there’s inadequate generic competition for that drug, meaning there is not more than one approved drug in the active section of the . The designation, which was established by Congress when it granted the FDA new authorities in the , provides certain incentives for industry to develop generics for drugs lacking competition that have been designated as CGTs. Under this pathway, companies may submit requests to designate a drug as a CGT at the time of submitting an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or at any time before the original ANDA submission. At the request of the applicant, the FDA may expedite the development and review of an ANDA for a drug that is designated as a CGT. CGT designation can afford companies a number of early benefits, including product development meetings with the FDA to discuss specific scientific issues or questions they may have such as proposed study design or alternative approaches. These early benefits may also help to reduce the number of application review cycles ultimately decreasing the time it takes for the generic drug to receive approval. If a CGT designation is granted, the application may be eligible for a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity provided the applicant is the first approved ANDA for that CGT and meets other conditions. Since being granted these new authorities, the agency has moved quickly in designating drugs as CGTs. To date, the FDA has granted more than 100 CGT designation requests, and in 2018 between August and December, the FDA approved the first five ANDAs for generic drugs designated as CGTs, and when the drugs covered by those ANDAs were commercially marketed those ANDAs qualified for 180-day exclusivity. The successful implementation of these new authorities demonstrates that the competitive generic therapy pathway is efficient and effective at promoting new competition. It’s also a key step in making safe and effective generic drugs available to patients quickly while helping to ensure there’s adequate competition in the market place, so patients have access to the treatments they need. But we know there are still many branded products on the market without generic competition. We must do more to encourage development of safe and effective generic competition to these sole source drugs. In addition to taking action to enhance generic competition, the FDA is working to make generic drug development more efficient and predictable. We’re working to reduce approval times and to enhance the efficiency of certain aspects of the submission process for generic drug applicants. And we’re also working to provide the generic industry with increased transparency to provide greater certainty around timing of first possible generic entry and potential competition from other generic entrants, and to make the scale up of manufacturing more efficient, to enable more informed decisions on how to prioritize their resources and come to market. We also recently a guidance providing application holders with clarity on information they are required to share with the FDA under another FDARA provision that will enable us to have more timely, accurate information about what drugs are being actively marketed to help provide transparency around circumstances where generic competition is lacking to inform our policy making. Building on those efforts, today the FDA has issued the new draft guidance aptly titled, , to help provide even greater clarity to industry about the CGT pathway. This new guidance provides robust information on how drug developers can apply for CGT designation and when they may be eligible for CGT exclusivity. The CGT pathway is intended to incentivize effective development, efficient review, and importantly the timely market entry of generic drugs. The FDA’s implementation of this new pathway is an important part of our broader effort to foster generic competition and help address the high cost of drugs and improve patient access to important medicines. Overall, addressing the challenges related to developing generics, and promoting more generic competition to these medicines, is a key part of our , and the agency’s efforts to help advance patient access to more affordable medicines.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., cautioning consumers against receiving young donor plasma infusions that are promoted as unproven treatment for varying conditions", "date": "February 19, 2019", "contents": " The FDA has recently become aware of reports of establishments in several states that are offering infusions of plasma from young donors to purportedly treat the effects of a variety of conditions. The conditions range from normal aging and memory loss to serious diseases like dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease or post-traumatic stress disorder. We have significant public health concerns about the promotion and use of plasma for these purposes. There is no proven clinical benefit of infusion of plasma from young donors to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent these conditions, and there are risks associated with the use of any plasma product. Today, we’re alerting consumers and health care providers that treatments using plasma from young donors have not gone through the rigorous testing that the FDA normally requires in order to confirm the therapeutic benefit of a product and to ensure its safety. As a result, the reported uses of these products should not be assumed to be safe or effective. We strongly discourage consumers from pursing this therapy outside of clinical trials under appropriate institutional review board and regulatory oversight. Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. It contains proteins that help clot blood and can be used for the management of bleeding and clotting abnormalities. The benefits of plasma have long been recognized, especially in trauma settings or in patients whose blood is unable to clot due to medications or certain illnesses. The FDA-recognized Circular of Information for the Use of Human Blood and Blood Components, published by AABB, lists recognized indications for which the administration of plasma is safe and effective; these are included in the FDA’s safety communication. For those patients receiving a plasma product for a recognized use, the benefits of treatment have been determined by the agency to outweigh its risks. But even under such recognized uses, plasma administration is not without risks. The more common risks are allergic reactions and transfusion associated circulatory overload and less common risks include transfusion related acute lung injury or transfusion associated circulatory overload and infectious disease transmission. Our concerns regarding treatments using plasma from young donors are heightened by the fact that there is no compelling clinical evidence on its efficacy, nor is there information on appropriate dosing for treatment of the conditions for which these products are being advertised. Plasma is not FDA-recognized or approved to treat conditions such as normal aging or memory loss, or other diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, reports we’re seeing indicate that the dosing of these infusions can involve administration of large volumes of plasma that can be associated with significant risks including infectious, allergic, respiratory and cardiovascular risks, among others. The administration of plasma for indications other than those recognized or approved by the FDA should be performed by a qualified investigator or sponsor who has an active Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. Clinical studies are performed under an IND to help ensure the safety of participants in the trials. When clinical trials are not conducted under an IND, it means that the FDA has not reviewed the experimental therapy to help make sure it is reasonably safe. Simply put, we’re concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors as cures and remedies. Such treatments have no proven clinical benefits for the uses for which these clinics are advertising them and are potentially harmful. There are reports of bad actors charging thousands of dollars for infusions that are unproven and not guided by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials. The promotion of plasma for these unproven purposes could also discourage patients suffering from serious or intractable illnesses from receiving safe and effective treatments that may be available to them. We strongly urge individuals to consult their treating physicians prior to considering the use of such products for aging indications or for the treatment of conditions such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease or post-traumatic stress disorder given the known and unknown risks associated with their use. We support sound, scientific research and regulation of medical treatments. We will use our tools and authorities to protect patients from unscrupulous actors and unsafe products. As a general matter, we will consider taking regulatory and enforcement actions against companies that abuse the trust of patients and endanger their health with uncontrolled manufacturing conditions or by promoting so-called ‘treatments’ that haven’t been proven safe or effective for any use. As a growing number of clinics offer plasma from young donors and similar therapies, we want to encourage consumers considering treatments to ask their health care providers to confirm that the FDA has reviewed any treatment that is investigational. You also can ask the clinical investigator to give you the FDA-issued IND number and to provide a copy of the FDA communication acknowledging the IND. We encourage patients to ask for this information before receiving treatment. Furthermore, we urge patients and their health care providers to report any adverse events related to treatment with plasma from young donors for aging or related indications to the FDA’s . The agency will continue to closely monitor this issue and take additional steps, as appropriate, along with state and local health departments and blood establishments.

{"title": "Statement from Binita Ashar, M.D., of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health on agency’s continuing efforts to educate patients on known risk of lymphoma from breast implants", "date": "February 06, 2019", "contents": " One of the most important roles we have as a public health agency is educating patients and health care providers about both the benefits and risks of medical products, including breast implants. I know there are many choices of breast implants available to patients, including the size, implant fill and surface texture. We want to provide patients with the most up-to-date information about the variety of breast implants available so that patients and providers can have thorough and thoughtful discussions weighing the benefits and risks of different products. We also want to be transparent in sharing the information we regularly gather and analyze in a way that provides important context to help inform these discussions. Today, we are providing an update regarding the number of cases of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a known risk from breast implants. In 2011, the FDA was the first public health agency in the world to communicate about the risks of BIA-ALCL, warning women that the available information at the time indicated that there is a risk for women with breast implants for developing this disease. Since then, we have regularly updated the information available on our regarding known BIA-ALCL cases, including deaths and known risks. We hope that this information prompts providers and patients to have important, informed conversations about breast implants and the risk of BIA-ALCL. At the same time, we remain committed to working in partnership with all stakeholders to continue to study, understand and provide updates about this important public health issue. Today, the agency is providing an updated number of medical device reports (MDRs), also known as adverse event reports. After a thorough data analysis, we are reporting that, as of September 2018, the agency has received a total of regarding BIA-ALCL cases since 2010. Of the 660 MDRs, our in-depth analysis suggests that there are 457 unique cases of BIA-ALCL, including 9 patient deaths. We understand that the information presented shows an increase of 246 new MDRs since last year. Given the agency’s continued efforts to communicate with stakeholders about BIA-ALCL risks and our work to encourage patients and providers to file MDRs with the agency, these types of increases in the MDRs are to be expected and may include past cases that were not previously reported to the FDA. The increased number of MDRs contributes to our evolving understanding of BIA-ALCL and represents a more thorough and comprehensive analysis. The number of unique cases is lower than the total number of reports because the FDA’s medical device reporting system allows patients, providers and manufacturers to each file their own reports even if it’s about the same case, which can lead to duplicative reports of BIA-ALCL. Through our review of each report, our team of experts works to remove duplicative information and analyze the data provided to help better understand what these reports may or may not tell us about the benefits and risks of the device. For example, our analysis of these reports is better when there is a wide-range of information provided concerning the breast implant texture and implant fill, and other helpful details like a patient’s age, how long a patient has been implanted, and time from implantation to diagnosis. This information helps us understand how and why this lymphoma may be occurring. Unfortunately, not every report provides thorough information about each case, including what type of breast implant (e.g., surface texture) the patient received, which makes it more difficult to know if any particular breast implant characteristic is associated with BIA-ALCL or if higher reports of BIA-ALCL are simply due to higher implantation rate of a particular manufacturer. In the interest of transparency, on our webpage, we provide a breakdown of the data and an analysis of that information that was provided to the agency. For patients, we know the information regarding breast implants can be overwhelming, which is why we are committed to continuing our efforts to provide up-to-date publicly available resources to help understand the known benefits and risks of implants. We encourage patients to review our website and read specific device labeling, including information, for any product they may consider implanting. Choosing to obtain a breast implant is a very personal decision that patients and their providers should make based on individual needs and with the most complete information about products. We are also aware that our counterparts in different countries are taking certain actions or may be reporting different information about breast implant safety than the FDA. The different devices approved in each country, availability of products, variation in market share, extent of medical device adverse event reporting, and availability of information regarding the total number of implants sold differs from country to country. This makes it difficult for the regulatory bodies of different countries to compare data and determine risk rates on a global scale. We recognize the limitations of medical device reports, which is why we review other sources of information, including medical literature and the Patient Registry and Outcomes for Breast Implants and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Etiology and Epidemiology ( ). PROFILE collects real world data regarding patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of BIA-ALCL. Our participation in this registry reflects the FDA’s commitment to implementing our , in which we are streamlining and modernizing how we implement postmarket actions to address device safety issues to make our responses to risks more timely and effective. In addition to updating our medical device reports, we are issuing today a to encourage those who regularly treat patients, including primary care physicians and gynecologists, to learn about BIA-ALCL in patients with breast implants. We want to ensure that all providers who treat patients with breast implants have information regarding identification, diagnosis and treatment. Patients are more likely to seek routine care from primary care physicians, gynecologists and others besides their treating plastic surgeon. By providing information to health care providers, we believe more providers will be empowered with information to assist patients who may have BIA-ALCL. We also encourage patients and providers to file medical device reports with the FDA via The FDA remains committed to thoughtful, scientific and transparent, public dialogue concerning breast implant safety and effectiveness. We know BIA-ALCL will be one important topic of discussion at the agency’s upcoming public meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel at the FDA’s headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland March 25-26, 2019. We look forward to engaging with patients, providers and manufacturers about a range of topics concerning the benefit-risk profile of breast implants in that public forum. The topics we will discuss at this meeting highlight the importance of continuing to monitor, assess and advance our understanding of breast implant safety. We will publish additional information regarding the meeting agenda on our breast implant webpage soon.

{"title": "Federal court enters consent decree against Ranier’s Rx Laboratory and owner for manufacturing purportedly sterile drug products in insanitary conditions", "date": "February 06, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a consent decree of permanent injunction today between the United States and Ranier’s Rx Laboratory Inc., doing business as Ranier’s Compounding Laboratory, of Jeanette, Pennsylvania, and pharmacist Francis H. Ranier, who owns the compounding facility. “We continue to see concerning activity when it comes to some compounded drugs, including problems related to the conditions under which compounded sterile medicines are made, which can raise significant risks to patients. This is an area of intense focus for the FDA. We’re committed to making sure that compounded drugs are made under appropriate production standards and, when necessary, taking enforcement actions against compounders who fail to produce sterile drugs in compliance with the law,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Despite our warning, Ranier’s and its owner placed patients at risk by compounding purportedly sterile drug products under insanitary conditions. The FDA will continue to pursue enforcement action against companies and owners who place American consumers at risk.” The consent decree prohibits Ranier’s and its owner from, among other things, manufacturing, holding, or distributing human or animal sterile drugs compounded at their facility until they comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and FDA regulations. The complaint filed with the consent decree alleges that Ranier’s manufactured and distributed purportedly sterile drug products, including injectable drugs for conditions such as erectile dysfunction and ophthalmic drugs for use as anesthetics, antibiotics, and cataract therapies, among others, that were adulterated under the FD&C Act because the drugs were made under insanitary conditions. On July 10, 2018, the FDA warned the public against using any human and animal drug products intended to be sterile that were produced by Ranier’s due to concerns about the company’s ability to assure the sterility of those products. On July 27, 2018, the compounder issued a press release regarding a voluntary recall of all its unexpired sterile compounded drug products. Under the consent decree, Ranier’s and Ranier cannot resume sterile compounding operations for human and animal drugs until they complete required corrective actions and receive authorization from the FDA.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps to strengthen the agency’s process for issuing public warnings and notifications of recalls", "date": "February 07, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is taking new steps to strengthen and modernize the process for issuing a public warning about a voluntary recall and for notification of recalls. Most companies collaborate with the FDA to rapidly initiate voluntary recalls and work with their supply chain partners to remove the product from shelves to prevent further distribution. And in general, a recall occurs quickly when the problem is discovered. However, there are situations where the FDA may need to provide safety advice to marketplace to protect consumers. In part to address these circumstances, in , we announced draft guidance for strengthening public warnings and notifications of recalls. It was the first in a series of policy steps that we’ve taken this past year to better arm consumers with information to protect themselves and their families. Over the last year we’ve also issued that describes situations where we will disclose retail information for recalled food products. And in November 2018 we finalized our for foods, intended to provide answers to common questions about the mandatory food recall provisions. We’re taking a new step to help ensure appropriate public warnings and notification of recalls when FDA-regulated products are involved. The we’re issuing today outlines circumstances when a company should issue a public warning about a voluntary recall, describes the general timeframe for companies to issue such a warning, discusses what information should be included in a public warning, and describes situations where the FDA may take action to issue its own public warning should a company’s warning be deemed insufficient. It also describes the FDA’s policy for moving forward with posting recalls to the , which is a web listing of all recalls monitored by the FDA, in some cases before a final health hazard evaluation is completed. We’ve already begun implementing the recommendations outlined in the final guidance. In accordance with the draft version of this guidance, we have issued or consumer warnings related to many products like . In April 2018, we also issued the first mandatory recall order for . And, this past summer the agency released detailed retail distribution information by state during a associated with an outbreak of Salmonella infections, so consumers could better identify where the recalled food may have been purchased or distributed. Some may feel like they’re seeing more recalls. In actuality, for there were a total of 7,420 recalls with 831 that were classified as the highest risk. That figure represents a five-year low in recalls. However, the reason why recall notices might seem to have increased is that our publicizing of these events has become more prominent. We’re routinely providing more information on recalls and other safety issues that have happened. We’ve also been communicating more frequently and, in many cases, directly to consumers through the agency’s social media. I believe that it’s critical for consumers to have this information so that they can take an action to protect their own health. Our ability to detect, track and trace potential or known problems with products continues to improve as we implement new technologies across the agency and as companies implement their own technological advances throughout their supply chains. Whole Genome Sequencing -- a kind of DNA fingerprinting -- has allowed federal, state and local health officials to detect related illnesses, match them more often with a food product, facility or environment, and trace the contamination to the source. We’re advancing other new steps to modernize our efforts and to improve how we provide information to consumers. Our experts are evaluating how new technologies might be used to notify consumers if they’ve purchased a product that is later recalled. Our labs are currently testing cutting-edge technology that can screen for multiple allergens simultaneously and even technology that shrinks the genetic testing of pathogens from machines that were once the size of an entire room to a device that’s smaller than many smart phones. We’ll also be working to improve product traceability by tapping into modern approaches, such as blockchain technology, to further advance our mission of protecting public health. Consumers should expect to continue to see more frequent communication on potential risks to their health. We’ll continue to seek out opportunities for improved processes, education and awareness. And we constantly strive to learn from every recall, and every issue, so that we can help to prevent future recalls and to work quickly with companies to remove the products from the market. I remain committed to investing in the FDA’s recall and outbreak programs, building on our successes, and applying the FDA's leadership and expertise to protect American families and keep our nation safe.

{"title": "FDA advances new proposed regulation to make sure that sunscreens are safe and effective", "date": "February 21, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a that would update regulatory requirements for most sunscreen products in the United States. This significant action is aimed at bringing nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreens that are marketed without FDA-approved applications up to date with the latest science to better ensure consumers have access to safe and effective preventative sun care options. Among its provisions, the proposal addresses sunscreen active ingredient safety, dosage forms, and sun protection factor (SPF) and broad-spectrum requirements. It also proposes updates to how products are labeled to make it easier for consumers to identify key product information. “Broad spectrum sunscreens with SPF values of at least 15 are critical to the arsenal of tools for preventing skin cancer and protecting the skin from damage caused by the sun’s rays, yet some of the essential requirements for these preventive tools haven’t been updated in decades. Since the initial evaluation of these products, we know much more about the effects of the sun and about sunscreen’s absorption through the skin. Sunscreen usage has changed, with more people using these products more frequently and in larger amounts. At the same time, sunscreen formulations have evolved as companies innovated. Today’s action is an important step in the FDA’s ongoing efforts to take into account modern science to ensure the safety and effectiveness of sunscreens,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The proposal we’ve put forward would improve quality, safety and efficacy of the sunscreens Americans use every day. We will continue to work with industry, consumers and public health stakeholders to ensure that we’re striking the right balance. To further advance these goals, we’re also working toward comprehensive OTC reform, which will help foster OTC product innovation as well as facilitate changes necessary for the FDA to keep pace with evolving science and new safety data.” The agency is issuing this proposed rule to put into effect final monograph regulations for OTC sunscreen drug products as required by the . OTC monographs establish conditions under which the FDA permits certain OTC drugs to be marketed without approved new drug applications because they are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) and not misbranded. Over the last twenty years, new scientific evidence has helped to shape the FDA’s perspective on the conditions, including active ingredients and dosage forms, under which sunscreens could be considered GRASE. In the proposed rule, the FDA makes the following proposals for sunscreens marketed without FDA-approved applications: “It is important that, as this rulemaking effort moves forward and the FDA gathers additional scientific information, given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, consumers continue to use sunscreen in conjunction with other sun-protection measures,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “To help make sure this effort is successful, the FDA is looking to industry to gather the data needed to help ensure that products marketed to offer protection from the sun’s effects are safe and deliver on these promises.” As this rulemaking process proceeds, OTC sunscreen products will continue to be available on the market for consumer use. Sunscreens are only one element of a skin-cancer prevention strategy. Other sun protective behaviors include: wearing protective clothing that adequately covers the arms, torso and legs; wearing sunglasses and a hat that provides adequate shade to the whole head; and seeking shade whenever possible during periods of peak sunlight. on the proposed rule and will consider comments provided as the agency works towards developing a final rule. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Proposes that, of the 16 currently marketed active ingredients, two ingredients – zinc oxide and titanium dioxide – are GRASE for use in sunscreens; two ingredients – PABA and trolamine salicylate – are not GRASE for use in sunscreens due to safety issues. There are 12 ingredients for which there are insufficient safety data to make a positive GRASE determination at this time. To address these 12 ingredients, the FDA is asking industry and other interested parties for additional data. The FDA is working closely with industry and has published to make sure companies understand what data the agency believes is necessary for the FDA to evaluate safety and effectiveness for sunscreen active ingredients, including the 12 ingredients for which the FDA is seeking more data. Proposes that dosage forms that are GRASE for use as sunscreens include sprays, oils, lotions, creams, gels, butters, pastes, ointments and sticks. Powders are proposed to be eligible for inclusion in the monograph, but additional data are requested before powders can be included in the monograph. Wipes, towelettes, body washes, shampoos and other dosage forms are proposed to be categorized as new drugs because the FDA has not received data showing they are eligible for inclusion in the monograph. Proposes to raise the maximum proposed SPF value on sunscreen labels from SPF 50+ to SPF 60+. Proposes to require sunscreens with an SPF value of 15 or higher to also provide broad spectrum protection and that, for broad-spectrum products, as SPF increases, the magnitude of protection against UVA radiation also increases. These proposals are designed to ensure that these products provide consumers with the protections that they expect. Proposes new sunscreen product label requirements to assist consumers in more easily identifying key information, including the addition of the active ingredients on the front of the package to bring sunscreen in line with other OTC drugs; a notification on the front label for consumers to read the skin cancer/skin aging alert for sunscreens that have not been shown to help prevent skin cancer; and revised formats for SPF, broad spectrum and water resistance statements. Proposes to clarify FDA’s expectations for testing and record keeping by entities that conduct sunscreen testing to ensure that the FDA can assess industry compliance with regulations. Proposes that products that combine sunscreens with insect repellents are not GRASE."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on efforts to spur development of innovative devices, including new advancements in novel brain implants, that can help patients with paralysis or amputation gain mobility", "date": "February 22, 2019", "contents": " Advances in technology and material science are enabling new opportunities to transform health and mobility through innovations in medical products. The FDA is committed to adopting pathways that allow patients efficient access to these safe and effective products. Today, as part of these efforts, I’m announcing a significant step to promote the development of a new generation of implantable devices that can be more fully integrated with the patient’s own brain. Known as brain-computer interface (BCI) devices, they hold the potential for direct control of, for example, a limb prosthesis by the patient’s thought processes. This can allow significantly greater mobility and independence for patients. These devices have the potential to benefit people with severe disabilities by increasing their ability to interact with their environment. This is a critical area of development for the millions of people who suffer from conditions that inhibit their mobility. Today, we’re issuing for patients with paralysis or amputation, including our nation’s veterans. This achievement is the result of our broader work to help ensure our regulatory framework is properly matched to the unique attributes of the new technologies we’re being asked to review. We’re committed to providing the right tools and fostering an environment that lets the developers of novel technologies advance innovative ideas, while prioritizing patient safety, and delivering on our public health mission. The draft guidance is considered a “leap-frog” guidance because it helps bridge where we are today with innovations of tomorrow, providing our initial thoughts about regulatory considerations for an emerging health technology with the understanding that our recommendations are likely to evolve as the FDA works to finalize the guidance to account for public comments, technological developments and new information. Our success in improving safety and driving innovation depends, in part, on our ability to quickly identify the potential for future technological breakthroughs that can alter the paradigm for how we approach certain medical challenges and advance these goals. Among other steps, the agency has committed to searching the landscape for these future innovations with the development of the Emerging Sciences Working Group, a team of 15 FDA experts representing various specialties and FDA Centers. The group is charged with leveraging scientific expertise and resources to conduct long-range horizon scanning, and advising agency and FDA Center leadership on how emerging issues and cross-cutting scientific advances may affect the FDA’s preparedness and activities across government agencies, including on advances that aren’t even on most people’s radars. The FDA is also committed to collaborating with stakeholders, including product developers, across the health care ecosystem on specific areas that we know are advancing and ripe for disruption. Often, we pull together stakeholders to discuss promising areas for development. For example, we recently held an event to discuss the development of . The workshop was intended to enhance engagement with stakeholders to facilitate device development and to discuss scientific and regulatory challenges associated with Orthopaedic SMART Devices. Public input and feedback gained through this workshop may aid in the efficient development of innovative, safe and effective Orthopaedic SMART Devices for better patient care. The workshop has resulted in a common understanding of the current stage of development for this promising technology and the possibilities for advancing patient care. There are many ways we identify these areas. Once we do, we work to ensure that the tools are in place to advance the development of these new technologies, by providing clarity and direction to medical device developers to help reduce the barriers of bringing new treatments to patients. We know innovation is often capital intensive and risky and we understand that we can help reduce the risk and cost of capital to advance these patient opportunities by giving clear direction early in the development process. At the same time, there are many examples of how novel technology is being harnessed to help patients live better lives. To take some recent examples where technology is transforming medical care, we have realized significant strides toward diabetes management with the advent of the automated insulin delivery systems to treat and manage type 1 diabetes; certain patients immobilized by various injuries and conditions are able to gain access to motorized exoskeletons to help them walk; and we’ve seen technology improve the way we diagnose and treat diseases and conditions with novel software. We’ve also seen meaningful advances in neurology and the FDA has helped advance research into biomarkers to detect early signs of traumatic brain injury and the development of patient-centric assessment methods for upper limb prostheses. The FDA has also been active in encouraging the development of the BCI devices that are the subject of today’s draft guidance. Our Center for Devices and Radiological Health held a public workshop to foster discussion of the scientific and clinical considerations associated with the development of BCI devices, defined for the purposes of the workshop as neuroprostheses that interface with the central or peripheral nervous system to restore lost motor or sensory capabilities. In other words, devices implanted into the brain that communicate with a patient’s nerves and muscles to help them gain mobility or a sense of touch. One of the outcomes of the workshop was the initiation and generation of the draft guidance being issued today. The FDA will consider public comment as it finalizes the draft guidance. The ultimate aim being to help potential developers of these novel devices address this area of unmet medical need and promote innovation while maintaining appropriate patient protections. Our work on BCI devices also reflects our deep commitment to help the men and women who bravely served our country and were injured, and may suffer from conditions that limit their mobility. Our duty to serve our veterans includes actively pursuing medical advances that protect and treat them during their service and support them in recovering from injuries. We believe that BCI technology has the potential to improve wounded veterans’ lives and those of other Americans in regaining mobility and thus improving their quality of life. The idea that a prosthetic could interact with the brain has been the topic of much imagination, but now we’re actually on the verge of realizing this opportunity. The FDA has an important role to play by laying out a path for developers on how to seize this prospect and advance the development of new devices. Our draft guidance on implanted BCI devices provides our proposed recommendations for developers on what non-clinical testing and clinical study design could be used to develop BCI devices for patients with paralysis or amputation. This includes detailed technical advice and recommendations for study designs to support safety and effectiveness of these novel devices. The draft guidance proposes that non-clinical device testing can be used to demonstrate that potential risks have been mitigated prior to initiating a clinical study. Proper design of clinical trials is essential to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness to support a regulatory submission to the FDA. This is the fourth leap-frog guidance we’ve issued for public comment and we have seen firsthand the impact they can have on realizing the potential of innovative technologies. For example, the agency previously issued a draft guidance, Technical Considerations for Additive Manufactured Medical Devices, to help further innovation around evolving and to encourage and support innovation in that field. Since then, we have seen advances in 3D printing including, for example the clearance of a system to print diagnostic use anatomic models at the point of care. Examples such as this demonstrate the impact that these types of leap-frog draft guidances can have in facilitating the development of medical devices that employ rapidly emerging technology, helping to expedite access to novel products, which may ultimately have a deep and lasting impact on patients’ lives. These types of draft guidances aim to help facilitate the development of medical devices that employ rapidly emerging technology by providing for public comment on the FDA’s proposed thinking, helping to expedite access to such products, which may ultimately have a profound impact on patients’ lives. The FDA encourages stakeholders to provide feedback on this new draft guidance to ensure that all viewpoints can be considered as the FDA finalizes the guidance to improve and facilitate development of these novel devices. We will also continue working to identify other areas of significant promise and support them with additional leap-frog guidance documents. Working together with researchers, developers, patients and providers, our aim is to advance policies that encourage more novel therapies that can dramatically alter the trajectory of health and mobility. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "FDA takes new steps to adopt more modern technologies for improving the security of the drug supply chain through innovations that improve tracking and tracing of medicines", "date": "February 07, 2019", "contents": " A key element of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s mission is focused on helping to ensure that all products we regulate, including drugs available to consumers, are safe and of high quality. This means working to ensure greater accountability in our nation’s drug supply chain. As part of these efforts, today, the agency is launching a new in which participants representing the drug supply chain (e.g., manufacturers, repackagers and other stakeholders) can pilot the use of innovative and emerging approaches for enhanced tracing and verification of prescription drugs in the U.S. to ensure suspect and illegitimate products do not enter the supply chain. Eligible entities may apply to participate in the program. The pilot will inform the development of the enhanced electronic, interoperable track-and-trace system for industry set to go into effect in 2023 as part of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. This new program will pilot technologies that may become part of our enhanced expectations for reliable track-and-trace systems. The new system will be aimed at reducing diversion of drugs distributed domestically and will help keep counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain, and ultimately, reaching patients. “As part of our ongoing efforts to protect our nation’s drug supply, today, we’re giving industry an opportunity to test new technologies that can help spur greater accountability for participants in the supply chain and improve our ability to trace prescription drugs at every point in the distribution chain. Using new innovations, we believe we can improve the overall security of our closed system and improve our ability to prevent the introduction of illegitimate products, better detect the introduction of illegitimate products, and enable stakeholders and the FDA to respond more rapidly when such products are found,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “We recognize that tracking and tracing products is critical to industry’s ability to detect and remove potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain. This pilot is one of many steps we’re taking to foster innovative ways to improve the security of the drug supply. We’re also focused on making improvements across the other products we regulate, especially related to food and our ability to address foodborne outbreaks. We’re invested in exploring new ways to improve traceability, in some cases using the same technologies that can enhance drug supply chain security, like the use of blockchain. To advance these efforts, the FDA recently recruited Frank Yiannas, an expert on the use of traceability technologies in global food supply chains. He’ll be working closely with me on ways for the FDA to facilitate the expansion of such methods, such as blockchain technology, to further strengthen the U.S. food supply. Under his leadership, we’ll continue to leverage all tools available to ensure greater accountability. For the drug track-and-trace system, our goals are to fully secure electronic product tracing, which provides a step-by-step account of where a drug product has been located and who has handled it; establish a more robust product verification to ensure that a drug product is legitimate and unaltered; and to make sure that any party involved in handling drugs in the supply chain must have the ability to spot and quarantine and investigate any suspect drug. We’re committed to staying at the forefront of new and emerging technologies and how they might be used to create safer, smarter and more trusted supply chains to better protect consumer safety and ensure the integrity of the high quality of products they deserve.” The DSCSA pilot project program is intended to help identify and evaluate the most efficient processes to comply with and apply drug supply chain security requirements. The program will aid in identifying attributes the system will need for enhanced product tracing and verification, as well as electronic means to share the information. The FDA is committed to sharing new approaches considered through this program with the broader drug supply chain community on the agency’s website. Our goal is to ensure that all parties can be apprised of its progress and take advantage of any shared learning. The FDA has previously taken steps to advance the development and adoption of technologies that can help identify and properly trace prescription drugs as they move through the supply chain. For example, the FDA recently issued draft guidance on the use of with a unique serial number to improve verification down to the package level. Additionally, the FDA has provided for verification systems to quarantine and investigate suspect and illegitimate drugs. Enhanced verification and tracing in the supply chain can translate to a more rapid response by industry and the FDA when an illegitimate product is found. DSCSA was enacted by Congress on Nov. 27, 2013. It outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.

{"title": "FDA pursues order barring specific retailers from selling tobacco products as part of its continuing efforts to target youth tobacco use", "date": "February 07, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today initiated enforcement action against certain retail locations of for repeated violations of restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including sales of cigars and menthol cigarettes to minors. The agency filed complaints seeking No-Tobacco-Sale Orders (NTSO), which seek to bar the two specific retail locations from selling tobacco products for 30 days. The two retail outlets that are the subject of these NTSO actions are a Walgreens store in Miami, Florida, and a Circle K store in Charleston, South Carolina. Notably, Walgreens is currently the top violator among pharmacies that sell tobacco products, with 22 percent of the stores inspected having illegally sold tobacco products to minors. “I will be writing the corporate management of Walgreens and requesting a meeting with them to discuss whether there is a corporate-wide issue related to their stores’ non-compliance and put them on notice that the FDA is considering additional enforcement avenues to address their record of violative tobacco sales to youth. We all share the important responsibility of keeping harmful and addictive tobacco products out of the hands of kids. Retailers in particular – especially those who position themselves as health-and-wellness-minded businesses – are on the frontlines of these efforts and must take that legal obligation seriously. I’m also deeply disturbed that a single pharmacy chain racked up almost 1,800 violations for selling tobacco products to minors across the country. I have particular concerns about whether the pharmacy setting is influencing consumer and retailer perceptions around tobacco products in a way that’s contributing to these troubling findings,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The FDA will continue to hold retailers accountable by vigorously enforcing the law. We are also evaluating our data on other large, national retail chains to identify other entities that also have high rates of repeat violations and are considering what additional measures we should pursue. While many of our recent enforcement actions focused on the illegal sales and marketing of e-cigarettes, today’s announcement is a reminder that youth access to all tobacco products remains a public health problem. No child should be using any tobacco or nicotine-containing product. And no retailer should be illegally selling these products to minors. As part of our Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan, we’ll continue to employ all the tools at our disposal to monitor, penalize and prevent sales of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to minors at brick-and-mortar stores and Internet storefronts as we work to ensure these products are sold in ways that make them less accessible and appealing to kids.” An estimated 4.9 million middle and high school students reported current (past 30 days) use of any tobacco product in 2018, according to of the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey. An over the last year has led overall tobacco product use to increase by 38 percent among high school students (to 27.1 percent) and by 29 percent among middle school students (to 7.2 percent) in the last year, reversing the declines seen in the last few years. Because tobacco use is almost always initiated and established during adolescence, early intervention ‒ including making sure tobacco products aren’t being sold to kids ‒ is critical. One of the ways the FDA combats youth tobacco use is through its compliance and enforcement efforts. In particular, the agency provides opportunities to retailers to encourage compliance with restrictions on sales to minors, monitors compliance through surveillance, inspections and investigations, and then takes action when violations occur. When violations are found, the agency generally issues warning letters and may take enforcement actions, including civil money penalties and NTSOs. Since its retailer enforcement program began in 2010, the FDA has issued more than 81,570 warning letters to retailers for violating the law, initiated more than 19,800 civil money penalty cases and issued 145 NTSOs, as of Dec. 31, 2018. The NTSO action against this Walgreens outlet follows the issuance of more than 1,550 warning letters and 240 civil money penalty actions against Walgreens stores nationwide for unlawful tobacco product sales to minors. This is, however, the first NTSO action taken against a Walgreens store. While the NTSO action against Circle K is not its first, it marks the first time the agency has initiated an NTSO complaint for the sale of deemed products (cigars) to minors. Since 2010, the FDA has issued over 1,045 warning letters and 205 civil money penalty actions to retailers doing business as Circle K for sales to minors. To put Walgreens’ rate of violations into perspective, among other national, corporate-owned chains, 17.5 percent of Walmart Inc. stores inspected had violations for illegal sales of tobacco products to minors. Additionally, 14 percent of Dollar General Corp. stores inspected, and 9.6 percent of Rite Aid Corp. stores inspected had illegally sold tobacco products to minors. Under the law, the FDA may pursue an NTSO against a retail outlet that has committed a total of five or more repeated violations of federal tobacco regulations within 36 months. After the FDA initiates an NTSO action by filing a complaint, a retailer has the opportunity to respond to the complaint, and must generally do so within 30 days. Retailers who receive an NTSO complaint from the FDA may enter into a settlement agreement or respond with an answer and contest the allegations before an administrative law judge. If an NTSO goes into effect, a retailer is responsible for ensuring that the establishment does not sell tobacco products during the specified period. Removing or covering up tobacco products are examples of steps that a retailer may choose to take to ensure compliance with an NTSO, but these specific actions are not required. It is up to the retailer to decide what measures to take to ensure no regulated tobacco products are sold at the store during the time period specified in the order. The FDA plans to conduct unannounced compliance check inspections during that period to check whether each establishment is complying with the terms of the order and will take further action if necessary. Consumers and other interested parties can report a potential tobacco-related violation of the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act, including sale of tobacco products to minors, by using the The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on unprecedented new efforts to support development of over-the-counter naloxone to help reduce opioid overdose deaths", "date": "January 17, 2019", "contents": " With the number of overdose deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids more than doubling over the last seven years to nearly 48,000 in 2017, it’s critical that we continue to address this tragedy from all fronts. This includes new ways to increase availability of naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdose. When someone overdoses on an opioid, the person may lose consciousness and breathing may become shallow or stop. This can rapidly lead to death if there’s no medical intervention. However, if naloxone is administered quickly, it can counter the overdose effects, usually within minutes. While the person administering naloxone should also seek immediate medical attention for the patient, the bottom line is that wider availability of naloxone and quick action to administer it can save lives. Naloxone is a critical drug to help reduce opioid overdose deaths. Prevention and treatment of opioid overdose is an urgent priority. Increased availability of naloxone for emergency treatment of overdoses is an important step. One potential way to improve access to naloxone is to make it available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale. FDA-approved versions of naloxone currently require a prescription, which may be a barrier for people who aren’t under the care of a physician or may be ashamed or even fearful of admitting to issues with substance abuse. Having naloxone widely available, for example as an approved OTC product, is an important public health advance, and a need that we’ve been working on at the FDA. Although FDA-approved prescription naloxone formulations have instructions for use in product labeling, they don’t have the consumer-friendly Drug Facts label (DFL), which is required for OTC drug products. Before submitting a new drug application or supplement for an OTC drug product, companies must develop a DFL and conduct studies to show that consumers can understand how to use the product without the supervision of a health care professional. Some stakeholders have identified the requirement to perform these studies as a barrier to development of OTC naloxone products. To encourage drug companies to enter the OTC market and increase access to naloxone, the FDA took an unprecedented step: we developed a model DFL with easy-to-understand pictograms on how to use the drug. We also conducted label comprehension testing to ensure the instructions were simple to follow. This is the first time the FDA has proactively developed and tested a DFL for a drug to support development of an OTC product. We proactively designed, tested and validated the key labeling requirements necessary to approve an OTC version of naloxone and make it available to patients. One of the key components for OTC availability is now in place. In short, we’ve crafted model labeling that sponsors can use to obtain approval for OTC naloxone and increase its access. This action was part of our broader commitment to addressing the opioid crisis. Today, we’re announcing the results of our work, including posting two model DFLs ( . These efforts should jumpstart the development of OTC naloxone products to promote wider access to this medicine. The model DFL contains the information (except for individual product-specific information) that a consumer needs to administer naloxone safely and effectively. During this period without a FY19 appropriation for the FDA, we’ve been focused on making sure that we continue critical aspects of our work, to the extent permitted by law. At this time, for products (such as naloxone) that are covered by a user fee program, our review of existing medical product applications and associated policy development regarding our review are funded by limited carryover user fee balances. We’ll continue to update the public on how we’re approaching our work during the lapse in appropriations. Consumer comprehension of the model DFL was iteratively tested by an independent research contractor in a prespecified research design involving over 700 participants across a wide range of potential OTC naloxone users. This included people who use heroin; people who use prescription opioids; family and friends of people who use opioids; adolescents; and the general public. An FDA review team not directly involved in the conduct of the study independently reviewed the study report and determined that the comprehension results were satisfactory. Overall, the study demonstrated that the model DFL was well-understood by consumers and is acceptable for use by manufacturers in support of their OTC naloxone development programs. Using this information, naloxone manufacturers can now focus their efforts on final label comprehension testing of how well consumers understand the product-specific information that hasn’t been already tested in the model DFL. I personally urge companies to take notice of this pathway that the FDA has opened for them and come to the Agency with applications as soon as possible. The model DFL comes in two versions. One is for use with a nasal spray and one for use with an auto-injector. But the product-specific instructions in each version are placeholders that have not been tested by the FDA for comprehension or human factors performance. Sponsors can replace these placeholders with their own product-specific information and test it if necessary. Apart from this product-specific information, the model DFL otherwise contains all the key information needed for an untrained bystander to administer naloxone. In designing the model DFL, the FDA team sought input from multiple stakeholders in the addiction care community, as well as from the FDA internal experts, to streamline the DFL to contain only the most critical information, so that it could be easily understood in an emergency. We’re grateful to the hundreds of study participants who helped us see this DFL through their eyes, which enabled us to refine the DFL multiple times until we reached a final version. These research participants enabled these efforts. This work builds on our ongoing efforts to get this life-saving drug into the hands of those who need it most. In addition to the approval of injectable naloxone for use in a health care setting and both prescription auto-injector and intranasal forms of naloxone, which facilitate use by laypersons, we also released draft guidance to advance development of generic naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray. Additionally, we also held a last month to solicit input and advice on strategies to increase the availability of naloxone products intended for use in the community. We asked our external advisors from the FDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committees to consider various options for increasing access to naloxone. As part of HHS’ ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis and expand the use of naloxone, in April 2017, the Department announced its to Combat the Opioids Crisis. Those efforts include: better addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services; better data; better pain management; better targeting of overdose reversing drugs; and better research. In April 2018, Surgeon General VADM Jerome Adams issued an encouraging more individuals, including family, friends, and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose to carry naloxone. In December 2018, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, MD, Assistant Secretary for Health and the Secretary’s Senior Advisor for Opioid Policy, released for health care providers and patients detailing how naloxone can help save lives. We’re taking many steps to improve availability of naloxone products and we’re committed to working with other federal, state and local officials; health care providers; patients; and communities across the country to combat the staggering human and economic toll created by opioid abuse and addiction.

This is the first test authorized by the FDA to test for the M. gen. bacterium, which is associated with inflammation of the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis) in men and inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis) and infection of the reproductive organs (pelvic inflammatory disease) in women. “Patients with unidentified urogenital infections are typically treated with antibiotics, some of which may not be effective against M. gen.,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “In the past, it has been hard to diagnose this organism. By being able to detect it more reliably, doctors may be able to more carefully tailor treatment and use medicines most likely to be effective. In cases where M. gen. is detected, doctors can consider forgoing use of antibiotics that are known to be ineffective against M. gen. and choose a treatment more likely to be appropriate. Having accurate and reliable tests to identify the specific bacteria that’s causing an infection can assist doctors in choosing the right treatment for the right infection, which can reduce overuse of antibiotics and help in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.” According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, M. gen. is responsible for causing approximately 15 to 30 percent of persistent or recurrent urethritis cases in men in the United States and 10 to 30 percent of cervicitis cases in women. M. gen. is a slow-growing bacterium and is difficult to detect with traditional laboratory methods. The Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium Assay, granted marketing authorization by the FDA today, is a nucleic acid amplification test, which detects M. gen. in urine, urethral, penile meatal, endocervical or vaginal swab samples collected in a clinical setting, such as a doctor’s office or clinic. The FDA reviewed data from a clinical study that included testing of 11,774 samples. The study showed that the Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium Assay correctly identified M. gen. in approximately 90 percent of vaginal, male urethral, male urine and penile samples. It correctly identified M. gen. in female urine and endocervical samples 77.8 percent of the time and 81.5 percent of the time, respectively. Vaginal swabs are the preferred sample type due to better clinical performance, however, alternative sample types, such as urine, can be used if vaginal swabs are not available. In addition, the study showed that the test correctly identified samples that did not have M. gen. present 97.8 to 99.6 percent of the time. The FDA reviewed the Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium Assay through the De Novo premarket pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Through the De Novo authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for tests of this type, including requirements for demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of tests intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of M. gen. urogenital infections. The special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium Assay to Hologic Inc.

{"title": "FDA statement from Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. announcing efforts to improve the quality of the information used to assess the effectiveness of REMS programs in supporting the safe use of medications", "date": "January 24, 2019", "contents": " In making decisions about whether the benefits of a drug outweighs its risks, there are many times when a drug provides important benefits, but also has serious risks. In some cases, if there is a greater assurance that those risks can be properly managed, then the benefits can support approval. This is the field of risk management, and it’s a critical function here at the agency. Today, we’re announcing the availability of two draft guidances that will help improve our ability to ensure that the risk mitigation programs put in place for certain drugs and biologics as a requirement of their approval are working. These risk mitigation programs can help make sure that benefits of these products continue to outweigh the risks. Risk management involves four key areas: assessing a drug’s benefit-risk balance; developing and implementing tools to minimize risks while preserving benefits; evaluating the effectiveness of such tools and re-assessing the drug’s benefit-risk balance; and making adjustments, as appropriate, to risk minimization tools to further improve the benefit-risk balance. Our primary risk management tool is communicating through FDA-approved product labeling, often referred to as the “package insert” or the “prescribing information,” which includes a summary of the essential information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of the drug. Labeling is sufficient for most drugs to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. But in a limited number of cases – 75 currently – the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) will also be needed to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. REMS are designed to reinforce medication use behaviors and actions that support the safe use of that medication. Most REMS include a requirement to foster communication between a doctor and patient, for example, about the specific safety risk or risks that the REMS is intended to mitigate. Some REMS also include additional elements that may ensure providers have, or provide to patients, all the appropriate information to appropriately prescribe or dispense the medication. This may include limiting access until health care providers complete an educational program, assess certain confirmatory laboratory tests, or document that they counseled patient about the potential risks. But just as important as setting the strategy for managing the risk is established, and setting clear goals for the program, is ensuring it is having the desired impact. From the onset of the REMS, the FDA works closely with companies that sell these products to determine the best way to assess its effectiveness in meeting its goals and maintaining the benefit-risk balance of the product. There’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to assess REMS programs, as each REMS assessment  is specifically designed for the specific REMS program. As with any public health initiative, evaluating the effectiveness of a REMS is an iterative process consisting of  periodic assessment and REMS modification if necessary. To that end, today we’re advancing new guidance on the assessment of REMS programs. The draft guidances (“ ”) provide a framework for companies to develop a REMS Assessment Plan at the same time that the REMS program is being developed in order to improve the quality of the information used to assess the effectiveness of a REMS program, and provide post-market evidence that the REMS is meeting its risk mitigation goals. The REMS Assessment draft guidance describes how to develop a REMS Assessment Plan by specifically considering how the REMS program goals, objectives and REMS design may impact the types of metrics and data sources that could be used to assess whether the program is meeting its risk mitigation goals. The draft guidance recommends incorporating both process indicators (i.e., the number of patients or health care providers who are enrolled or certified in the REMS) and outcome measures (i.e., the number of prevented fetal exposures to a teratogenic drug) in the REMS Assessment Plan. Examples of metrics and data sources to evaluate the performance of the REMS are provided in the guidance. For example, drug utilization data, surveys of stakeholders, postmarket adverse event data, observational or epidemiological data as well as stakeholder input may all be helpful in assessing a REMS program. We’ve also outlined considerations for assessing the impact of REMS on patient access to the drug or the burden that the REMS impose on the health care delivery system. These considerations are critical implications of instituting REMS and can impact patient care. Properly assessing these isues can help in the design and implementation of more efficient, effective REMS. The second guidance we are issuing today, the REMS Survey Methodologies draft guidance, provides recommendations on conducting REMS assessment surveys to evaluate patient or health care provider knowledge of REMS-related information, such as the serious risks and safe use of a medication. The draft guidance discusses general principles and recommendations related to conducting REMS assessment knowledge surveys, including study design, survey data collection and processing and data analysis. During this period without a Fiscal Year 2019 appropriation for the FDA, the agency has been focused on making sure it continues critical aspects of our work, to the extent permitted by law. At this time, for products covered by a user fee program, such as those under a REMS, our review of existing medical product applications and associated policy development is funded by limited carryover user fee balances. The FDA will continue to update the public on how we’re approaching our work. It’s critical that we develop and implement rigorous ways to assess the effectiveness of REMS in real-world settings. We need to make sure that the REMS are achieving their public health goals, and that we’re designing and implementing these approaches in ways that minimize burdens to patients and providers. We know there’s still much to learn about the science of risk management. Approaches and scientific methods for assessing the effectiveness of REMS continue to evolve. Our goal in providing this latest thinking on assessing REMS programs is to ensure we’re constantly improving the programs we have in place today, and establishing the most efficient and effective programs moving forward, to optimize patient care and keep Americans safe and healthy. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Jeff Shuren, M.D., Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on latest steps to strengthen FDA’s 510(k) program for premarket review of medical devices", "date": "January 22, 2019", "contents": " In 2018, the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health achieved several new milestones, including a record-setting year for approvals of novel medical devices. We also focused on advancing several meaningful initiatives and policy proposals aimed at enhancing the safety of medical devices, including the safety of devices cleared through the FDA’s 510(k) review process. We articulated those concepts early in the year as part of the FDA’s and most recently with our of changes to strengthen the 510(k) program. The Safety Action Plan described actions we’ve taken over the past several years to enhance device safety and outlined our vision for how the agency can build on these initiatives to further assure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. As we start the new year, we’re dedicated to executing on the commitments we laid out last year and implementing our proposed new policies. As we , one of our goals is to ensure that the 510(k) program is keeping pace with the important innovations we’re seeing in device development. We believe this means that, where appropriate, new medical devices coming to market under the 510(k) pathway should either account for advances in technology that can improve the safety or performance of these products, or demonstrate that they meet more modern safety and performance criteria. Today, we’re pleased to announce two developments toward advancing this policy effort. First, the FDA posted its establishing the framework for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway . The new name for this guidance reflects our focus on advancing new products with improved safety and performance. This option for 510(k) clearance will modernize our approach to moderate risk devices by allowing manufacturers to use objective performance criteria established or recognized by the FDA to facilitate demonstration of substantial equivalence of their new products to legally marketed devices. Under the traditional approach, manufacturers often rely on comparative testing against a device already on the market, known as a predicate device, to show that a new device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. But, the predicates may be older and, consequently, they may not reflect the modern technology embedded in new devices of that type. For appropriate device types, the Safety and Performance Based Pathway will ensure that the performance characteristics of new devices are evaluated against a set of objective, transparent and well-validated safety and performance metrics. It’s important to note that devices using this pathway will still have to meet our current standards for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness before they can be marketed. The benefit of this approach is that the pathway will benchmark modern technology against modern standards while, at the same time, offering a potentially more efficient way to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to devices already on the market, and thereby ensure patients have timely access to beneficial products. We also believe this new approach may drive greater market competition to develop safer devices. By using this pathway, manufacturers would have demonstrated that their products meet objective safety and performance criteria that are based on modern technological principles. This year, we’ll build on today’s final guidance by establishing safety and performance criteria for certain well-understood device types. We’ll issue these criteria through guidance, which includes an opportunity for public comment prior to using them under the new pathway. In addition, today, the FDA is soliciting on steps that we could take to further encourage medical device manufacturers to develop innovations that enhance the safety of 510(k) devices. One possible way to advance this goal could be to focus on the use of more modern predicate devices. As we noted above, older predicates might not closely reflect modern technology used in new devices. While this doesn’t mean the products that reference those predicates are unsafe, it does mean there is an opportunity to examine how we can enhance the process to ensure devices are continually improving so patients can reap the benefits of modern advancements. To that end, as we discussed in our , we’re considering whether, in addition to the information in the 510(k) database, the FDA should post on its website a list of FDA-cleared devices that demonstrated substantial equivalence to older predicate devices. Doing so would create more transparency about these technologies, with the goal of driving device manufacturers to offer patients devices with the latest improvements. However, we recognize that for some types of well-established technologies there is not a need for improvements, and reliance on older predicates would not only be appropriate but necessary. We’re seeking comment on this new proposed approach, as well as other questions that will help inform our regulatory policy development, including: The FDA has to receive comment on these questions, and we request that any responses be provided within 90 days. We’re committed to engaging with the public on our approach to 510(k) modernization and look forward to receiving and reviewing this feedback. We believe firmly in the merits of the 510(k) process. Thousands of devices are cleared through this process each year and countless thousands more patients benefit from these technologies. In taking these new steps today, we’re reaffirming our commitment to continually strengthening our review process, so that it can continue to serve and protect American patients well for years to come. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Guidance previously titled “Expansion of the Abbreviated 510(k) Program: Demonstrating Substantial Equivalence through Performance Criteria.” Should the FDA make public a list of devices, or manufacturers who make technologies, that rely on predicates that have been on the market for more than a certain number of years (e.g., 10 years)? If so, what would be an appropriate period of time? Should the FDA consider using other criteria to inform our point of reference? Are there other and/or alternative actions we should take to promote the development and marketing of safer, more effective 510(k) devices? Should the FDA consider certain actions that might require new authority, such as making at least some older devices ineligible as predicates?"},
{"title": "FDA takes action against 17 companies for illegally selling products claiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease", "date": "February 11, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today posted 12 and 5 online issued to foreign and domestic companies that are illegally selling more than 58 products, many that are sold as dietary supplements, which are unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded drugs that claim to prevent, treat or cure Alzheimer’s disease and a number of other serious diseases and health conditions. These products, which are often sold on websites and social media platforms, have not been reviewed by the FDA and are not proven safe and effective to treat the diseases and health conditions they claim to treat. These products may be ineffective, unsafe and could prevent a person from seeking an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. “Science and evidence are the cornerstone of the FDA’s review process and are imperative to demonstrating medical benefit, especially when a product is marketed to treat serious and complex diseases like Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s is a challenging disease that, unfortunately, has no cure. Any products making unproven drug claims could mislead consumers to believe that such therapies exist and keep them from accessing therapies that are known to help support the symptoms of the disease, or worse as some fraudulent treatments can cause serious or even fatal injuries. Simply put, health fraud scams prey on vulnerable populations, waste money and often delay proper medical care – and we will continue to take action to protect patients and caregivers from misleading, unproven products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Today’s actions are part of the FDA’s larger effort to address the booming growth of the dietary supplement industry through the implementation of modern regulatory initiatives that will enable the agency to preserve the balanced vision of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), enacted by Congress 25 years ago. That law sought to achieve the right balance between preserving consumers’ access to lawful supplements, promoting innovation in these products, while upholding our obligation to protect the public from unsafe and unlawful products and holding accountable those actors who are unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the law. Our newest policy efforts will seize the game-changing opportunity to further strengthen the regulatory framework overseeing dietary supplements and will hone in on important steps to both promote industry innovation while upholding the safety of these products as part of our overall commitment to protecting public health.” , FDA Commissioner Gottlieb also outlined several important new actions and policy priorities the agency will take in the coming months to improve the safety of dietary supplements and purported dietary supplements, including efforts to more rapidly communicate potential safety issues with dietary supplement products with the public, establishing a flexible regulatory framework that promotes innovation and upholds product safety and other, new steps the FDA could consider taking to better ensure product safety and integrity. The products cited in the warning and online advisory letters posted today are unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded drugs that claim to prevent, treat or cure Alzheimer’s disease and a number of other serious diseases and health conditions, and have been sold in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The products include a variety of product types, such as tablets, capsules and oils. The companies have been asked to respond to the FDA within 15 days of receipt of the letters, stating how the violations outlined in the agency’s letters will be corrected. Failure to correct the violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and/or injunction. As part of the FDA’s effort to protect consumers from Alzheimer’s disease health fraud, the FDA has issued more than 40 in the past five years to companies illegally marketing over 80 products making Alzheimer’s disease claims on websites, social media and in stores. We’ve also taken action in recent years against companies and dietary supplements making similar claims for the treatment of serious conditions such as . Although these companies may have stopped selling the products or making unproven claims, numerous unsafe and unapproved products continue to be sold directly to consumers due in part to the ease with which companies can move their marketing operations to new websites. The FDA continues to encourage consumers to remain vigilant whether online or in a store in order to avoid purchasing products that claim to prevent, treat or cure diseases without any proof they will work. Health care professionals and consumers are also advised to report adverse reactions associated with these or similar products to the agency’s The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on the agency’s new actions under the Pre-Cert Pilot Program to promote a more efficient framework for the review of safe and effective digital health innovations", "date": "January 07, 2019", "contents": " Digital technologies create new opportunities to transform health care and empower patients to make better informed decisions about their health. Digital tools are rapidly evolving, and to keep pace with this promising innovation, the FDA must modernize its approach to regulation. That’s why I announced in the that the FDA would pilot a Digital Health Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program to make sure that patients continue to have access to new treatments that meet our gold standard for safety and effectiveness. Since that announcement, we’ve been advancing policies that reimagine our oversight of digital health tools to be more efficient and promote patient safety throughout the product lifecycle. We’ve seen the promise of innovation in products like that can help alert physicians to a potential stroke and that can help identify atrial fibrillation. Today, we’re announcing that, based on the Pre-Cert pilot, we’ve drafted a regulatory framework to test new approaches for the review of digital health device applications. Our goal in piloting the Pre-Cert Program was to support the development of new technologies that are frequently updated, as well as to learn from software developers about the unique nature of their products. We focused on ways to streamline our oversight of digital health products by reviewing and appraising the developer’s culture of quality and organizational excellence. Our aim has been to develop a Pre-Cert program that would allow developers who have been assessed by the FDA for meeting specific excellence principles—known as an “Excellence Appraisal”—to participate in a more tailored premarket submission process appropriate for their specific type of digital device. Our digital health team has been working with patients, providers, the participating in the Pre-Cert pilot program and other stakeholders to build this framework. Today we’re issuing three documents that, together, launch us into the next phase of the agency’s vision of Pre-Cert. These components are a key step in advancing the Pre-Cert model. We look forward to obtaining public input as we implement these elements in the coming months. First, one of the most important components is explaining our regulatory framework for the Pre-Cert program. We believe the most efficient way to test this type of program is to do so within the FDA’s current regulatory authorities. We know many stakeholders have had questions about how this would work. Today, we’re releasing our outline, titled , to describe how the agency intends to use our De Novo pathway for novel technologies to implement the next phase of the Pre-Cert pilot. Our De Novo pathway is well-suited to meet the goals of our Pre-Cert program because it is a pathway for certain novel types of low- to moderate-risk devices to obtain marketing authorization. Currently, firms submitting products for review under the De Novo pathway must also meet applicable Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements, which include demonstrating software design control and validation, and current good manufacturing practices. These requirements are meant to demonstrate and provide assurance to the FDA that a manufacturer makes products that are safe and effective and meet the De Novo statutory standard. In the Pre-Cert model, many of these QSR requirements would be satisfied by information the FDA collected through the Excellence Appraisal process, which is aimed at evaluating the quality and excellence of the software developer for Pre-Cert. By collecting this information early, the Excellence Appraisal could be leveraged to streamline a developer’s De Novo submission, reducing content the developer would need to submit to the agency under the De Novo pathway since the information would already have been demonstrated and documented during the Excellence Appraisal. This allows the FDA to tailor the premarket submission content to the unique considerations related to each particular digital health device and enables more efficient evaluation of low-risk digital health devices. Second, to further refine how this De Novo process would work for Pre-Cert, we need to test this type of implementation, which is why today we also released our . This year, we intend to test our pilot program to assess how Pre-Cert can maintain our standards for assuring safe and effective products, while still achieving its aim of modernizing and streamlining our review of novel digital health products. We want to test how the Pre-Cert approach utilizing the streamlined De Novo pathway compares to our traditional submission pathway. To do so, we will review the sponsor’s traditional De Novo submission for its device and using that same submission information we will, in parallel, review the sponsor’s Excellence Appraisal information with the proposed streamlined submission content. The sponsor will incur no additional burden. Instead, the FDA will set up two parallel review processes, one using the Pre-Cert model and one using the traditional approach to the review of a De Novo application. As highlighted in the test plan, this approach will help the FDA show that the combined assurance resulting from the proposed Excellence Appraisal and streamlined premarket review submission will provide the same quality and type of information necessary for the FDA’s determination of whether a software developer’s products meet the statutory safety and effectiveness standard, as compared to the FDA’s approach in reviewing these devices under the traditional De Novo review process. The results and learning from this testing will provide input for refining our Pre-Cert program as well as confirm the validity of the concept envisioned in the Pre-Cert framework. At the conclusion of the testing and refinement, we expect to have confirmed that the evidence collected through the proposed Excellence Appraisal and streamlined De Novo submission meets the statutory requirements for granting marketing authorization. Third, we are releasing today an update to our that incorporates the Regulatory Framework and Test Plan described above, which will help us understand how well Pre-Cert will work now, but also help us establish the components we envision for the future of Pre-Cert. The Pre-Cert model begins with appraising the excellence of the firm and reviewing related documentation, including elements corresponding to De Novo submission content and Quality System requirements and documenting that review. This Excellence Appraisal step is followed by a review of the streamlined Pre-Cert De Novo request submission described in the Regulatory Framework, which would include submission elements and a manufacturer’s plan to monitor and evaluate the real-world performance of the software. Proactive monitoring of real-world performance enhances an understanding of how the software continues to perform while in use, while helping the developer and the FDA to quickly identify and address potential safety issues along with additional benefits to patients. As I recently in an update on our , access to robust and timely data, including more extensive and informative post-market data and real-world evidence, helps the FDA identify, communicate and act on new or increased medical device safety concerns. Such data serves as the foundation of our commitment to improving our nation’s post-market medical device surveillance. It’s one of the core pillars of our safety action plan. By utilizing the power of real-world performance data on software, Pre-Cert will help the FDA and developers better evaluate the real-world benefits and risks of these tools, and more quickly identify and address any issues and communicate safety information to patients. The Working Model describes the proposed approach for implementing Pre-Cert under our current authority. It also outlines the agency’s broader vision for Pre-Cert. Since launching the pilot program, we have been transparent about how we are building the program and have frequently requested and reviewed public feedback. In this third draft of the Working Model, the public will see how we’ve incorporated into the model the extensive feedback received, and we look forward to on this version and the other documents released today. Together, the plans we’re launching today demonstrate our ongoing commitment to building a Pre-Cert program that recognizes the unique and iterative characteristics of digital health products, as well as their significant potential to improve the lives of patients. Our new actions will promote the development of novel, beneficial technology while ensuring that patients have access to high quality, safe and effective digital health devices. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on new policies to advance development of safe and effective cell and gene therapies  ", "date": "January 15, 2019", "contents": " The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications. Based on this activity, we anticipate that the number of product approvals for cell and gene therapies will grow in the coming years, reflecting significant scientific advancement and the clinical promise of these new innovations. We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA. And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products. During this period without a FY19 appropriation for FDA, we’ve been focused on making sure that we continue critical aspects of our work, to the extent permitted by law. At this time, for products covered by a user fee program, including cell and gene therapy products, our review of existing medical product applications and associated policy development is funded by limited carryover user fee balances. We’ll continue to update the public on how we’re approaching our work. We’re working to expand our review group dedicated to the evaluation of these applications to keep pace with the rapid expansion in new product development. Our eventual goal is to add about 50 additional clinical reviewers to the group charged with overseeing the clinical investigation, development, and review of these products. The activity reflects a turning point in the development of these technologies and their application to human health. It’s similar to the period marking an acceleration in the development of antibody drugs in the late 1990s, and the mainstreaming of monoclonal antibodies as the backbone of modern treatment regimens. In the case of antibodies, it was a product innovation that sparked an inflection point in the advance of those products, after which antibody drugs became a mainstay of medical care. Specifically, it was the widespread adoption of safe and effective platforms for humanizing antibodies and, eventually, developing fully human monoclonal antibodies that weren’t rejected by the body’s innate immune system. In the case of gene therapy, it’s similarly a product innovation that has marked an inflection point in the development of these therapies, and a surge in new product activity. In this case, it was the advent of safe and effective vectors for the delivery of gene therapy products, such as the adoption of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The fact that product innovations are a key enabling advance in promoting the development of these products into effective therapies underscores the importance of advancing sound policy related to innovation around these product-related issues. Gene therapy products now have the potential to cure intractable diseases, and fundamentally alter the trajectory of many other vexing illnesses. To advance these opportunities, the FDA plans to introduce additional new policy guidance and other advances in our drug development framework in 2019. Today, we want to take an opportunity to preview that policy agenda and offer some perspective on the focus of our policies over the coming year as it relates to these technologies. First, we will work with sponsors to make maximum use of our expedited programs including regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation and accelerated approval. We believe that for gene therapy products that are offering meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the accelerated approval pathway offers some unique opportunities. For one thing, the accelerated approval pathway may offer a faster route to approval for new treatments, including potentially curative benefits in significant, unmet medical needs. But the pathway also offers additional authorities for FDA to require postmarket follow-up studies. Since many of the risks associated with gene therapy products relate to questions about the product’s durability and potential for rare instances of off-target effects, it may not be feasible to conduct pre-market trials that address all these theoretical risks in any reasonably sized study. Robust postmarket tools, such as those afforded to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway, particularly for products granted RMAT designation, can help achieve the goal of developing a larger data set to address these theoretical risks in a timely fashion. Second, we’re planning a series of clinical guidance documents related to different areas of active product development. Among the clinical guidance documents that we intend to advance include guidance documents for the development of gene therapy products for inherited blood disorders such as hemophilia, among others. We also intend to develop a guidance document for providing recommendations on product development issues related to the development of gene therapy products for certain neurodegenerative diseases. Here the accelerated approval pathway may only be applicable in certain circumstances. For example, we intend to propose guidance to address how the accelerated approval pathway may be used when the target of the gene therapy product is an underlying monogenetic change that causes a serious disorder not addressed by available therapy. In these cases, the gene therapy could offer the potential to alter or cure the underlying genetic defect that gives rise to, and causes the advance of, a disease. Our guidance will also propose how a more traditional approach to drug development may be more appropriate if the gene therapy creates a genetic alteration aimed at treating the symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, or potentially altering its course by altering the expression of a protein or enzyme believed to play a role in the advance of a disease. In these cases, the gene therapy wouldn’t be intended to cure the underlying condition but instead, affect its course or symptoms. We intend to explain that demonstrating the safety and benefits of such an approach could typically require a more traditional clinical study and recommend ways this can be achieved. Other critical challenges also arise in the development of safe and effective cell-based gene therapies such as CAR-T cells, including the complexities associated with manufacturing these products in a safe, reliable and cost-effective way, and in a manner that allows for the efficient use of these products in the clinic. Our new guidance will recommend parameters for how innovators can introduce advances in manufacturing that promote the more efficient development and application of CAR-T therapies without necessarily requiring costly new clinical investigations. We intend to propose ways to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of the resulting products through available technologies and examinations, and when limited clinical bridging studies may be needed prior to approval of a change, possibly followed by the submission of additional clinical information supplied by real-world data after the change is introduced. This category of guidance documents that we intend to develop will help advance scientific principles related to the efficient development of CAR-T and other cellular therapy products. The guidance that we intend to issue will promote a better understanding of the critical quality attributes and other factors related to product manufacturing. One of our goals here is to allow for the development of clearer parameters for when minor manufacturing changes can be made that wouldn’t require additional bridging studies. We will also be working with stakeholders and intend to hold a public meeting in the coming months to discuss ways to expedite the necessary clinical bridging studies when more than minor changes are introduced in the manufacturing process, but such changes do not represent a transformation to a fundamentally different product. We intend to introduce various topics, such as the refinement of genetic constructs and the introduction of more efficient cell culture methods. We also intend to develop new guidance to continue to promote the efficient development of safe and effective cell-based regenerative medicine products. Though we are very encouraged by the advances in science and clinical development in this field, we remain concerned at the FDA that a number of individuals working in this space are developing products that are subject to pre-market approval, but these individuals are operating outside of regulatory compliance and, in some cases, these products are creating potential significant safety concerns to patients based on how we believe the cell therapies are being manufactured and delivered to patients. In these cases, the manufacturers have failed to respond to the FDA’s request to have a dialogue with the agency about how to come into regulatory compliance. We plan additional enforcement actions in 2019 to address products that pose a significant risk of potential harm to patients. At the same time, we are committed to continue to develop efficient pathways by which sponsors can come into regulatory compliance while working toward approval of a new Biologics License Application (BLA) for their products. To advance this goal, one guidance that we intend to issue this year will outline a proposed innovative trial design by which individual researchers can pool their clinical data after following a common manufacturing protocol, and thereby develop a more robust data set for purposes of gaining a BLA. The idea here is to assist small sponsors, including academic investigators, who may not be of sufficient scale to conduct a clinical trial on their own, to band together with others similarly situated. These sponsors can then pool clinical data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product that is manufactured with a common manufacturing protocol and product quality specifications, and used for a common clinical purpose, but where the therapies are being delivered locally by different investigators and institutions. We already have consortiums of academic investigators who are in active discussions with the FDA about this proposed new approach. The guidance document we intend to issue will outline more clearly the recommended procedures for pursuing this novel approach. Taken together, these guidance documents, along with other policies that we plan to issue in 2019, are aimed at helping advance the field of cell and gene therapy. We believe these cell-based and gene therapy technologies hold tremendous promise for addressing some of the most intractable diseases. But with their novelty, also comes new uncertainties and some unique, theoretical risks. Our efforts are aimed at helping innovators proactively address these potential risks, while we outline a modern and efficient pathway for the continued development of these innovations."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on the agency’s new efforts to strengthen regulation of dietary supplements by modernizing and reforming FDA’s oversight", "date": "February 11, 2019", "contents": " The use of dietary supplements, such as vitamins, minerals or herbs, has become a routine part of the American lifestyle. Three out of every four American consumers take a dietary supplement on a regular basis. For older Americans, the rate rises to four in five. And one in three children take supplements, either given to them by their parents or, commonly in teens, taking them on their own. That’s why today we are announcing a new plan for policy advancements with the goal of implementing one of the most significant modernizations of dietary supplement regulation and oversight in more than 25 years. I’ve personally benefited from the use of dietary supplements and, as a physician, recognize the benefits of certain supplements as a part of a comprehensive care plan. It’s clear to me that dietary supplements play an important role in our lives as we strive to stay healthy. It’s also clear that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plays an important role in helping consumers make use of safe, high-quality dietary supplements while also protecting Americans from the potential dangers of products that don’t meet the agency’s standards for marketing. In the 25 years since Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), the law that transformed the FDA’s authority to regulate dietary supplements, the dietary supplement market has grown significantly. What was once a $4 billion industry comprised of about 4,000 unique products, is now an industry worth more than $40 billion, with more than 50,000 – and possibly as many as 80,000 or even more – different products available to consumers. DSHEA imposes a number of requirements around the manufacture and labeling of dietary supplements. We know that most players in this industry act responsibly. But there are opportunities for bad actors to exploit the halo created by quality work of legitimate manufacturers to instead distribute and sell dangerous products that put consumers at risk. As the popularity of supplements has grown, so have the number of entities marketing potentially dangerous products or making unproven or misleading claims about the health benefits they may deliver. Making healthy choices about diets can have a significant and positive impact on Americans’ health. To be able to make those choices with respect to dietary supplements, consumers need to have access to safe, well-manufactured, and appropriately labeled products. One of my top goals is ensuring that we achieve the right balance between preserving consumers’ access to lawful supplements, while still upholding our solemn obligation to protect the public from unsafe and unlawful products, and holding accountable those actors who are unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the law. Today, we’re announcing new steps we intend to advance to achieve these twin goals. These steps include communicating to the public as soon as possible when there is a concern about a dietary supplement on the market, ensuring that our regulatory framework is flexible enough to adequately evaluate product safety while also promoting innovation, continuing to work closely with our industry partners, developing new enforcement strategies and continuing to engage in a public dialogue to get valuable feedback from dietary supplement stakeholders. The opportunity to strengthen the framework that governs dietary supplements couldn’t come at a more pivotal time. On the one hand, advances in science and the growth and development in the dietary supplement industry carries with it many new opportunities for consumers to improve their health. At the same time, the growth in the number of adulterated and misbranded products – including those spiked with drug ingredients not declared on their labels, misleading claims, and other risks – creates new potential dangers. Legitimate industry benefits from a framework that inspires the confidence of consumers and providers. Patients benefit from products that meet high standards for quality. I’m concerned that changes in the supplement market may have outpaced the evolution of our own policies and our capacity to manage emerging risks. To continue to fulfill our public health obligations we need to modernize and strengthen our overall approach to these products. Toward these goals, the FDA is committing to new priorities when it comes to our oversight of dietary supplements at the same time that we carefully evaluate what more we can do to meet the challenge of effectively overseeing the dietary supplement market while still preserving the balance struck by DSHEA. As part of our comprehensive efforts, today we sent 12 whose products, many of which are marketed as dietary supplements, are being illegally marketed as unapproved new drugs because the products bear unproven claims to prevent, treat or cure Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a number of other serious diseases and health conditions, including diabetes and cancer. Products intended to treat Alzheimer’s disease must gain FDA approval before they are sold in order to help ensure they are safe and effective for their intended medical use. Dietary supplements can, when substantiated, claim a number of potential benefits to consumer health, but they cannot claim to prevent, treat or cure diseases like Alzheimer’s. Such claims can harm patients by discouraging them from seeking FDA-approved medical products that have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these medical conditions. In recent years, we’ve also taken action against companies and dietary supplements making similar claims regarding treatment of serious conditions such as . These enforcement actions are just one part of our overall efforts to update our policy framework governing dietary supplements. At the FDA, we have an obligation to ensure that we’re using the resources that we have as efficiently and effectively as we can, and as we engage in discussions about whether our existing resource levels are adequate, I take that obligation very seriously. That’s why I recently directed the establishment of a Dietary Supplement Working Group at the FDA, led out of my office and comprised of representatives from multiple centers and offices across the agency. I’ve tasked this group with taking a close look at our organizational structures, processes, procedures and practices in order to identify opportunities to modernize our oversight of dietary supplements. Additionally, when the FDA created the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs (ODSP) three years ago, the agency recognized that keeping up with the evolving marketplace meant giving dietary supplement regulation more attention and making it a higher priority. One of the things that this office has done is to articulate the FDA’s strategic priorities on dietary supplements to ensure that we’re focusing our attention and using our resources in ways that make sense. Our first priority for dietary supplements is ensuring safety. Above all else, the FDA’s duty is to protect consumers from harmful products. Our second priority is maintaining product integrity: we want to ensure that dietary supplements contain the ingredients that they’re labeled to contain, and nothing else, and that those products are consistently manufactured according to quality standards. Our third priority is informed decision-making. We want to foster an environment where consumers and health care professionals are able to make informed decisions before recommending, purchasing or using dietary supplements. In the coming months, we’ll be providing additional details on the steps we are taking to continue moving our dietary supplement program forward to implement these priorities. Our new approach benefits consumers by balancing new policies to promote innovation and efficiency in the marketplace for dietary supplements with increased steps to protect the public from potential safety issues. Today, I’m also announcing the first of several important steps to help advance our important policy goals. Among the steps that we’re considering or actively formulating, first are new ways to communicate more quickly when we have concerns that an ingredient is unlawful and potentially dangerous and should not be marketed in dietary supplements. We’re developing a new rapid-response tool to alert the public so consumers can avoid buying or using products with that ingredient, and to notify responsible industry participants to avoid making or selling them. Second, we also need to ensure that our regulatory framework is flexible enough to adequately evaluate product safety while promoting innovation. The key to this effort will be important steps to foster the submission of new dietary ingredient (NDI) notifications. An effective NDI notification process represents the FDA’s only opportunity to evaluate the safety of a new ingredient before it becomes available to consumers and helps promote transparency and risk-based allocation of resources. We’re continuing to develop guidance for preparing NDI notifications to ensure FDA can thoroughly review the safety of these ingredients. In conjunction with this effort, we’re planning to update our compliance policy regarding NDIs. We know these are important and timely issues and we’re also planning a public meeting this spring on the topic of responsible innovation in the dietary supplement industry. I expect the feedback received during this meeting will be essential as we move to modernize our approach toward NDIs. We’ll look to address other challenges that may act as barriers to dietary supplement innovation and safety including issues such as what the right incentives might be for establishing dietary supplement exclusivity, and the scope of permitted dietary ingredients. We invite all our stakeholders to share their views on how the FDA should strengthen the dietary supplement program for the future. So, please stay tuned for more information regarding registration and logistics. Third, as with other commodities that the agency regulates, it’s critical that the FDA continue to work closely with our partners in industry to achieve our primary goal of protecting public health and safety. As the dietary supplement industry develops new products and ingredients, advances new delivery systems and innovates in other ways, the FDA must do more to leverage its existing resources and authorities to evaluate these products. This requires collaborative research and a shared understanding. I’m pleased to announce that we’ve recently created the Botanical Safety Consortium, a public-private partnership that will gather leading scientific minds from industry, academia and government to promote scientific advances in evaluating the safety of botanical ingredients and mixtures in dietary supplements. This group will look at novel ways to use cutting-edge toxicology tools, including alternatives to animal testing, to promote the goals of safety and effectiveness we share with consumers and other stakeholders. Fourth, we’ll continue to take actions to protect public health – like those we took today for illegal Alzheimer’s disease products – and develop new enforcement strategies, as a key element of our approach to protecting consumers as the risks evolve. We’re already making our internal processes more efficient for taking enforcement action when products claiming to be supplements contain unlawful ingredients, including drug ingredients. For example, we took strong action to protect consumers from the dangers of dietary supplement products marketed in bulk and containing pure and highly concentrated caffeine. We in November to not purchase Rhino male enhancement products because they were unapproved new drugs that contained sildenafil and/or tadalafil, which are among active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Viagra and Cialis. During the same month, we to companies for unlawfully marketing as dietary supplement products that contained a compound called tianeptine; these products were unapproved new drugs that bore unproven claims that the products could be used to treat opioid addiction. We’ve also been active with compliance and enforcement efforts against firms that have shown persistent inability to comply with the current good manufacturing practice requirements for dietary supplements, and taking action to protect the public against unsafe imports and recalled products. Finally, we’ll engage a public dialogue around whether additional steps to modernize DSHEA are necessary. We’ve heard from stakeholders who want to open such a dialogue. While the FDA is committed to leveraging its existing resources and authorities to the fullest extent possible, we believe there may be value in a broader public conversation about whether certain changes to the law might be helpful. We believe there may be opportunities to modernize DSHEA for the future, while preserving the law’s essential balance. For example, some stakeholders have suggested that the statute should be amended to establish avenues for dietary supplement exclusivity and add a product listing requirement. A mandatory listing requirement could provide significant benefits by improving transparency in the marketplace and promoting risk-based regulation. It could also help facilitate efficient enforcement of the law and establish new mechanisms to identify bad actors who put the public at risk and undermine consumer confidence in the entire industry. We’re interested in hearing other ideas our stakeholders may have, and not just those limited to changes to the law, so we can go about the task of regulating this space in a way that reflects where the industry is today, and continue to safeguard consumers’ ability to access safe, compliant dietary supplements for the next 25 years. For example, is it possible to design a product listing regime that helps us protect consumers and level the playing field for responsible industry participants by making it easier for us to take swift action against illegitimate and dangerous products, such as products that are tainted with drug ingredients? And is it possible to do this without disrupting the balance struck by DSHEA, and without imposing any significant new burdens on responsible firms? The answer to these questions may very well be yes. And if that’s the case, these are absolutely things that we should be talking about. I’m confident that the efforts we’re announcing today, and the ones that we’ll continue to advance in the months and years to come, will help us achieve these goals on behalf of consumers. The steps outlined today highlight both where we are currently and where we look forward to moving toward. We are eager to continue our work with both our industry partners and dietary supplement consumers and will announce more upcoming ideas that we hope to roll out in the near future. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new data demonstrating rising youth use of tobacco products and the agency’s ongoing actions to confront the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use", "date": "February 11, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released from our joint FDA/CDC 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey. These data are a sobering reminder of the initial results we shared indicating a rampant rise of youth e-cigarette use, which has prompted the FDA to take a series of escalating regulatory actions as part of our . We are advancing those actions, and committing to some new steps. The epidemic use of e-cigarettes among children is one of the biggest public health challenges currently facing the FDA. According to the data released today, approximately 4.9 million middle and high school students were current users (used in the past 30 days) of some type of tobacco product in 2018, up from 3.6 million in 2017. This increase is driven by an alarming surge in e-cigarette use. More than 3.6 million middle and high school students were current (past 30 day) e-cigarette users in 2018, a dramatic increase of more than 1.5 million students in one year. The study authors suggest -- as the FDA also noted at the time of the initial release of this data in the fall – that the rise in e-cigarette use in the last year is likely due to the recent popularity of certain types of e-cigarettes, such as JUUL. Further, youth who use e-cigarettes also are using them more frequently and using flavored products more often than last year. Many youth tobacco product users are also using multiple products. Among current tobacco users, about 2 in 5 (1.68 million) high school students and 1 in 3 (270,000) middle school students used two or more tobacco products in 2018. The most commonly used tobacco product combination was e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes among both middle and high school students. Similarly, data from the recent National Institutes of Health’s found comparable trends: From 2017 to 2018, current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use reportedly increased from 6.6 percent to 10.4 percent among 8th grade students; 13.1 percent to 21.7 percent among 10th grade students; and 16.6 percent to 26.7 percent among 12th grade students. In other words, more than a quarter of 12th graders in the U.S. are using e-cigarettes—exposing them to harmful effects of nicotine and other chemicals and putting them at risk of transitioning to other tobacco products. These risks were further reinforced in research recently published in , which showed that, compared with non-users, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to transition to conventional cigarettes ‒ risking a lifetime of addiction to smoking and resulting smoking-attributable disease and erasing the reductions in youth smoking rates that we’ve achieved in America. The bottom line is that kids using e-cigarettes aren’t kids who “would have smoked cigarettes.” Quite the opposite. As a society, we’ve made great strides in stigmatizing cigarette use among kids. The kids using e-cigarettes are children who rejected conventional cigarettes, but don’t see the same stigma associated with the use of e-cigarettes. But now, having become exposed to nicotine through e-cigs, they will be more likely to smoke. I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes. We must stop the trends of youth e-cigarette use from continuing to build and will take whatever action is necessary to ensure these kids don’t become future smokers. Based on a growing body of evidence, I fear the youth trends will continue in 2019, forcing us to make some tough decisions about the regulatory status of e-cigarettes. The signs that we’re seeing are not encouraging. They point to continued growth in youth use of these products. No child should be using any tobacco or nicotine-containing product. We’ll continue to take steps to try to investigate the root causes of this spike in youth e-cigarette use and arrest the momentum of these trends, in particular, by ensuring these products are sold in ways that make them less accessible and appealing to youth. But, if these youth use trends continue, we’ll be forced to consider regulatory steps that could constrain or even foreclose the opportunities for currently addicted adult smokers to have the same level of access to these products that they now enjoy. I recognize that such a move could come with significant impacts to adult smokers. The FDA has repeatedly affirmed our collective view that e-cigarettes may have promise as a tool for helping currently addicted adult smokers quit smoking. But, with the staggering data on youth trends, we’re struggling to preserve these opportunities for adults while addressing the youth epidemic. I simply won’t allow their sale to come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids to nicotine. To help address this growing use among kids, over the past year, the FDA has taken a rigorous enforcement stance, including a number of actions to combat the illegal sales of e-cigarettes to youth through our at brick-and-mortar and internet storefronts, as well as taken steps to target companies engaged in kid-friendly marketing that increases the appeal of these products to youth. I’ve also appealed to the companies responsible for many of these products, and met with senior executives from five of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarette products. In addition, last week, I sent letters to the chief executive officers of Altria Group Inc. and JUUL Labs Inc. asking to meet with them to discuss my concerns that they don’t seem fully committed to their written promises about the steps they’d take to stop youth use of their products. Just last week, the FDA against certain local Walgreens and Circle K retail locations for repeatedly selling tobacco products to minors by filing a complaint seeking to bar the two specific retail locations from selling tobacco products for 30 days. As part of that effort we’re also writing the corporate management of a number of large, national retail chains to discuss whether there is a corporate-wide issue related to their stores’ non-compliance and put them on notice that the FDA is considering additional corporate-wide enforcement avenues to address violative tobacco sales to youth, which have also included illegal sales of e-cigarettes to kids. This past fall, we marked a historic milestone of conducting a total of one million tobacco retailer inspections since we began doing so in 2010. To commemorate this, we’re sending letters to governors and agencies across the country thanking them for their work to support our efforts to protect youth – and reminding them of the need for continued vigilance to make sure retailers aren’t selling tobacco products to minors. Beyond enforcement and social responsibility, we’ve committed to meaningful policy changes. Notably, in November, I announced to protect youth by preventing access to flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. This policy framework will both address the disturbing trend of youth e-cigarette use and advance the historic declines we’ve achieved in recent years in the rates of combustible cigarette use among kids. This framework reflects a re-doubling of the FDA’s efforts to protect kids from all nicotine-containing products. It also reflects a very careful public health balance between steps to enable the opportunities to transition to non-combustible products to be available for adults; and our solemn mandate to make nicotine products less accessible and less appealing to children. In other words – a balance between closing the on-ramp for kids to become addicted to nicotine through combustible and non-combustible products, while maintaining the off ramp for adults through access to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery for adult smokers seeking to transition away from combustible tobacco products. Evidence shows that minors are especially attracted to flavored e-cigarette products, and that youth access these products from both brick and mortar retailers as well as online. With that in mind, we’re revisiting our compliance policy that has resulted in certain e-cigarettes, including flavored e-cigarettes, remaining on the market until 2022 while their manufacturers submit applications for premarket authorization. In particular, as I announced on Nov. 15, 2018, the FDA is revisiting the compliance policy on premarket tobacco product application authorization for all flavored e-cigarette products other than tobacco, mint, and menthol, sold in physical locations where people under the age of 18 are permitted. For example, this would include e-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products, such as e-liquids, cartridge-based systems, and cigalikes, in fruit and candy flavors like cherry, vanilla, crème, tropical, melon and others. In addition, we will seek to curtail the sale of applicable flavored ENDS products that are sold online without heightened age verification processes. We’ll be providing further information on these policies soon. If data continue to show upwards trends in youth use of tobacco products, we’ll continue to refine our policies as necessary, taking additional steps to strengthen our response. More recently, we’ve undertaken efforts to further the discussion and understanding around how we can help aid those kids who are already addicted to the nicotine in e-cigarettes quit. This includes holding a to discuss efforts to eliminate youth e-cigarette use as well as other tobacco product use, with a focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation and the issues impacting the development of such therapies for youth. Already, I’ve heard too many troubling stories from parents of teenagers, pediatricians, and young people themselves about the effects of this epidemic. The stories make clear that, for many young e-cigarette users, addiction has already taken hold. “The Real Cost” Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign – a new, comprehensive effort targets nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. The new campaign features hard-hitting advertising on digital and social media sites popular among teens, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages in high schools across the nation. The new e-cigarette prevention effort builds off the FDA’s first youth tobacco prevention campaign, “The Real Cost,” which launched in 2014 to reduce teen cigarette smoking. In its first two years, the youth smoking prevention campaign and resulted in savings of more than $31 billion for youth, their families and society at large by reducing smoking-related costs like early loss of life, costly medical care, lost wages, lower productivity and increased disability. The success of “The Real Cost” campaign suggests that our other tobacco prevention campaigns, including our campaign on youth use of e-cigarettes, can build on this success as we strive to reduce the number of kids who use tobacco products. As part of the youth e-cigarette prevention campaign, we also to expand distribution of youth e-cigarette prevention posters to every public and private high school in the U.S. and released for doctors, youth groups, churches, state and local public health agencies, and others on the dangers of youth e-cigarette use. Additionally, our work with Scholastic to provide educators with resources to help them engage with students about e-cigarette use has helped reach more than 2.7 million students so far. We’ve also received very positive teacher feedback on the helpfulness of these resources. Vaping remains a top issue at some schools, but teachers are reporting that vaping on campus has declined after using these resources on the dangers of youth e-cigarette use. While these efforts are a good start, we recognize they’re not enough. This is an exploding epidemic. We’ll continue to put the full scope of our regulatory tools against this mounting public health crisis. We’re considering some new steps for 2019. Moving forward, the FDA has a number of actions planned and we’ll have more to say on these and other actions very soon. We’re continuing our stepped-up enforcement actions with a sustained campaign to monitor, penalize and prevent e-cigarette sales to minors in retail locations, including manufacturers’ internet storefronts. The agency is also exploring action under both its civil and criminal enforcement tools to target potentially violative sales and marketing practices by manufacturers as well as retailers. We’re also investigating counterfeit e-cigarette products. In addition to our meeting with Altria and JUUL, we also plan to meet with state attorneys general to discuss how they can help combat youth e-cigarette use in their states. We’re also exploring how we can partner with others to look at opportunities to work together around these shared goals. These are just some of the additional steps that we’re taking. The numbers are clear – we’re experiencing epidemic-level rises in youth e-cigarette use, which is threatening the progress we’ve made toward reducing youth tobacco use. These trends require forceful and sometimes unprecedented action among regulators, public health officials, manufacturers, retailers and others to address this troubling problem. Our commitment to stemming the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use has not waivered, but we know there’s more to be done by all parties. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Jeff Shuren, M.D., Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on a record year for device innovation", "date": "January 28, 2019", "contents": " The FDA’s focus on both safety and innovation stems from our historic mission to protect and promote public health—to assure that medical devices on the U.S. market are high-quality, safe and effective and to facilitate innovation and assure that patients and providers have timely and continued access to these high-quality, safe and effective devices. Spurring innovation to develop safer, more effective devices is key to improving patient safety. We are equally committed to advancing safe and effective products that can address unmet medical needs to reduce the health effects from disease. Both objectives are essential to meeting our public health mission, resulting in more lives saved and improved quality of life. In the final weeks of 2018, we issued several statements and reports to inform the public about additional actions the FDA was taking to continue to modernize our approach to device safety, building on our April 2018 and taking into consideration public feedback on this plan. The Action Plan described some of the steps we’ve taken over the past few years to enhance device safety and outlined our vision for how the agency can build on these initiatives to further assure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. As we noted in the Action Plan and in our statements, innovation and safety go hand-in-hand. One measure of our success in advancing device innovation is the annual number of novel, safe and effective technologies the FDA approves or clears. Last year marked another record year, supported by the new policies, processes and programs we’ve implemented over recent years to help efficiently promote safe and effective innovation in medical device development. Last year, in 2018, the FDA approved 106 novel devices, surpassing the 40-year record we set in 2017 of 99[ ] novel device approvals, and capping off eight years of steady improvement. The agency has also granted 112 Designation requests since the start of the program in April 2015, and, during 2018, approved or cleared nine breakthrough devices. Just a few examples of innovative new products that have come to market in 2018 as a result of our efficient, risk-based approach to total product life-cycle regulation include: expanded approval of an to include people with diabetes who are as young as age 7; the world’s for newborns; the first in the world to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (“concussion”); the first app to help treat substance abuse disorders, and technologies using artificial intelligence to in adults with diabetes and for aiding providers in the . We also approved the in the U.S. and permitted marketing of a new prescription medical device that measures eye movement as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion. These are among many novel innovations that came to market in 2018. Our effort to promote innovation is eclipsed only by our commitment to make sure that these products are safe for patients. Our success in providing patients with new treatments and diagnostics, and more options for effective health care, are not coming at the expense of the robust non-clinical and clinical science on which we rely to make our regulatory decisions. For example, due in part to our efforts to strengthen the clinical trial enterprise and leverage real world data, in some cases we’re receiving clinical evidence more quickly and more efficiently and answering postmarket questions we would not have been able to easily address in the past. In 2019, we’ll continue to move forward with our plans to implement the We also plan to establish premarket pathways that foster innovations to enhance patient safety while continuing to build a more robust patient safety net in the U.S. One way we can promote innovation is to drive competition for developing safer devices. We recently for manufacturers for an alternative 510(k) pathway initially proposed in April—the FDA’s “Safety and Performance Based Pathway”—by which companies would demonstrate they meet safety and performance criteria developed by the FDA based on the performance of more modern predicate devices (cleared, U.S. legally marketed devices) when they seek to bring new devices to patients. In the coming year, we will begin to establish safety and performance criteria for certain well-understood device types to allow manufacturers to demonstrate they meet the FDA’s criteria, including when it comes to product safety. We will also take forward the other aspects of the 510(k) modernization we recently announced, including consideration of actions that might require new authority, such as making at least some older devices ineligible as predicates. This year we also expect to issue a proposed framework for the Safer Technologies Program (STeP) and for this we will consider how we could apply Breakthrough Device principles and features to products intended to treat or diagnose non-life-threatening diseases or conditions, but which offer substantial safety innovations that either reduce the occurrence of a serious adverse event or other safety issue; address a known device failure mode or common user error; or provide for significant safety advantages for users. Our success in driving better safety and greater innovation depends, in part, on our ability to be innovative. We need to be able to continually adapt our frameworks, try new approaches, and, where necessary, seek new authorities because science does not stand still. Advances in material science, digital health, 3-D printing and other technologies continue to drive an unparalleled period of invention in medical devices. It’s vital that the FDA’s regulatory approach continue to evolve and modernize to safely and efficiently advance these opportunities. Not only must we keep pace with this complexity and innovation, but we must also stay ahead of the new and evolving risks that can sometimes accompany novel products. We must skate to where the puck will be, and, even better for patients, drive the puck to where it should be. That requires the willingness to embrace and lead change. By continuing to enhance and implement the right tools and foster an environment that lets the FDA be innovative, while prioritizing patient safety, we’ll continue to deliver on our public health mission. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. 1. We have defined novel devices as original PMAs, panel track supplement PMAs and de novos. In light of changes made by the 21st Century Cures Act to the Breakthrough Devices Program, we are broadening our definition of novel devices to include HDEs and Breakthrough Device 510(k)s. Under this updated definition we approved/cleared 98 novel devices in CY 2017 and 106 novel devices in CY 2018."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on ongoing efforts to stop the spread of illicit opioids, further secure the U.S. drug supply chain and forcefully confront opioid epidemic", "date": "February 12, 2019", "contents": " The opioid epidemic continues to be one of the greatest challenges facing this nation and the FDA. As we continue to take a range of steps to forcefully confront the opioid crisis plaguing our country, most people think first and foremost about the agency’s work to encourage more appropriate prescribing to decrease exposure to opioids and prevent new addiction, as well as our initiatives to advance innovations in both novel pain therapies and better treatments to help those with opioid use disorder. Our efforts to combat this public health emergency, however, extend also to stopping the spread of illicit opioids and further securing all aspects of the supply chain for legitimate medications, including opioids. On the illicit drugs front, we’ve worked to increase our enforcement and interdiction work targeting illegal, unapproved, counterfeit and potentially dangerous products being shipped illegally through international mail facilities (IMFs). Tens of millions of packages are estimated to contain FDA-regulated products, and a surprisingly high percentage of these products are illegal. In fact, in recent years, 86 percent of the packages that were suspected of containing FDA-regulated products and were pulled for FDA review indeed contained illegal, illicit, unapproved, counterfeit and/or potentially dangerous drugs. In 2017, the U.S. Postal Service processed nearly parcels, a volume that has been growing at roughly . In fact, the reported that 80 percent of the websites providing guidance on how to mail illicit drugs instructed traffickers to use the Postal Service for shipments. The FDA also has special agents that are assigned to the IMFs who work closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FDA regulatory staff, who identify and refer suspect shipments, and who, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, bring criminal cases to prosecution. These port of entry investigations have proven to be successful in holding criminals accountable, resulting in hundreds of arrests, prosecutions, guilty pleas and convictions. In addition to our work at the IMFs, we’re also working with federal partners to conduct criminal investigations targeting the operations of international criminal groups, both public and on the dark web. Every package stopped, every online network shut down and every criminal convicted reduces the risk that illegal and dangerous drugs will get into the hands of unknowing patients. We’ve also been active in combating the illegal online sales of opioids. Over the last year, the FDA has sent a series of to online networks, operating at least 70 websites, illegally marketing potentially dangerous, unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medications. Increasingly, patients are going online to illegally buy opioids like Vicodin, Percocet or Oxycontin but are either not receiving what they ordered, or they are simply being scammed out of their money. Last June, the FDA hosted internet stakeholders and thought leaders, government entities, academic researchers and advocacy groups at an to discuss ways to collaboratively take stronger action in combatting the opioid crisis by reducing the availability of illicit opioids online. Just as critical are the FDA’s efforts to protect patients from exposure to drugs that get into the legitimate U.S. supply chain that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise harmful, as well as making sure these same drugs aren’t being diverted for illegal sale. Entities within the supply chain must also comply with the law and do their part to respond quickly and thoroughly when notified of potential counterfeit, stolen or diverted products entering the supply chain. While the U.S. drug supply chain is among the safest in the world, complacency isn’t an option. Every link in the supply chain must be secure to ensure patient access to safe and effective medicines. We all need to remain vigilant to protect patients and make sure drugs meant for patients aren’t being stolen or diverted. That means accountability throughout the supply chain, including important oversight by the FDA to ensure every entity within the chain is complying with the law. And I want to be clear, the FDA won’t hesitate to act when companies violate the law and jeopardize the safety of Americans by neglecting their responsibilities to maintain the security of the supply chain, especially when it comes to opioids. Today, as part of our work to secure the drug supply chain, we’re announcing that the FDA has issued its first warning letter under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) to . for violations highlighted by a concerning tampering incident that involved opioid medications. Other incidents involved medications for serious medical conditions including HIV, seizures, bipolar disorder and high blood pressure. Under the DSCSA, manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers – which are mainly pharmacies – are all required to have systems and processes in place to quarantine and investigate suspect and illegitimate medications. These systems must be in place in order to respond rapidly to notifications of illegitimate products and to notify trading partners and the FDA when illegitimate products are discovered. The warning letter to McKesson outlines violations observed during that took place this past summer, including failing to: sufficiently respond to notifications that there was illegitimate product in their supply chain; quarantine and investigate suspect products; and maintain records of investigations of suspect product and disposition of illegitimate product as the law requires. In one instance outlined in the letter, McKesson was notified by a pharmacy customer that multiple of their pharmacy locations received bottles that were supposed to contain potent opioid pills. However, once opened, the pharmacies discovered that bottles at three pharmacy locations did not contain the correct medications, and the opioid pills were missing, having been replaced with other non-opioid medications. The pharmacy customer notified McKesson about the discovery of illegitimate products. While McKesson’s internal investigation noted that it was likely the opioid medication was replaced while in their possession or control, McKesson did not sufficiently respond to the notification that they may have distributed illegitimate products. McKesson could not demonstrate that they took efforts to identify or quarantine additional illegitimate products that may have still been in their distribution facilities. Additionally, McKesson did not notify other pharmacy customers who may have received products with the same lot number or National Drug Code to make them aware of potential illegitimate product in the supply chain. Additional examples are given in the warning letter of similar failures by McKesson to: respond to illegitimate product notifications; quarantine and investigate suspect and illegitimate products; and maintain records as required by DSCSA. This is simply unacceptable. A distributor’s failure to have systems in place to investigate and quarantine suspect and illegitimate products within their control is a violation of the law. But this is even more concerning given that we’re in the midst of a widespread opioid crisis. Opioids that leave the legitimate supply chain could end up being sold illegally, or a patient who was appropriately prescribed these drugs to treat pain may not get the treatment they need or may unknowingly take a medication that’s not meant for them. This may put the patient at risk of side effects or adverse drug interactions. The security of the supply chain, and continued implementation and enforcement of DSCSA, is an important tool in our efforts to ensure that the American public can have confidence in the products they receive, and that illegitimate opioid products do not find their way into the hands of patients. We’ll continue our efforts to help ensure manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers and others responsible for maintaining the supply chain are taking measurable steps under the law to appropriately track and trace medications – including opioids – as they move through the supply chain, and to respond to incidents involving illegitimate products in order to protect the public health. These efforts are critical to protecting patients from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise harmful, as well as making sure these same drugs aren’t being diverted for illegal sale on the black market. With a tighter, closed system, we’ll be able to better detect and prevent the introduction of illegitimate products and enable stakeholders and the FDA to respond rapidly when such products are found. These steps complement our enhanced enforcement and interdiction activities aimed at drugs such as illicit opioids being shipped illegally through the IMFs and our crackdown on illegal online sales. We’ll continue to hold all parties accountable for further securing the U.S. drug supply chain and stopping the spread of illicit drugs. This is only one of many actions in our comprehensive efforts to combat the opioid crisis. Important work is continuing on our plans to, among other things, re-examine and modernize the FDA’s framework for evaluating the benefits and risks of opioids in the pre- and post-market settings to consider the individual and public health impacts including potential clinical advantages and a product’s potential risks for illicit use or its potential for abuse. Among the new steps the FDA is taking: the agency is developing, and intends to publish in 2019, new guidance that describes our application of the risk/benefit framework to opioid analgesics, taking into consideration the full range of risks associated with these products, including the risks created by illicit use. As we solicit input from the public later this year, we’ll also ask questions about how the FDA should be evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new opioid analgesics relative to existing opioid drugs that are already on the market, and how that information might relate to our evaluation of the risks and benefits of new products at the time of approval. In addition, we’re also developing new guidance to modernize the development pathway for non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. This new guidance will take the place of our February 2014 analgesic development guidance. The current guidance recommends sponsors to study new analgesic drugs across a range of conditions that caused pain in order to receive broad indications for the treatment of acute or chronic pain. Instead, in the new guidance documents we will encourage more focused drug development. The FDA will identify specific clinical conditions such as certain kinds of post-surgical pain or back pain, to facilitate new analgesics seeking more narrow indications. This can make the development process more efficient and lead to the approval of drugs more carefully tailored to specific patient needs. Among the issues the FDA will also address is how sponsors developing non-opioid alternatives for pain can seek claims that they decrease the use of opioid analgesics. We’re also in the midst of work to advance the development of evidence-based guidelines for appropriate opioid analgesic prescribing for acute pain resulting from specific conditions or procedures, as well as advancing requirements for certain packaging (e.g. unit-dose packs) to limit the number of pills that a patient receives with a single prescription to mitigate the risk of abuse, misuse and diversion. We remain committed to using our regulatory authority to the fullest extent to address this crisis, including using granted to the FDA by the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, and building on the important work we’ve and are currently undertaking to change the trajectory of this epidemic. As we work to promulgate new policy, ensure compliance with the law, and encourage development of alternative medicines, we expect that companies will continue to do their part to help bring this epidemic under control, including ensuring the integrity of their supply chains. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Statement on the FDA’s ongoing investigation into valsartan and ARB class impurities and the agency’s steps to address the root causes of the safety issues", "date": "January 25, 2019", "contents": " Last summer, the FDA learned and reported that some generic versions of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) medicines contain nitrosamine impurities that don’t meet the agency’s safety standards. ARBs, including valsartan, irbesartan, losartan and others, are a class of medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Nitrosamine impurities, including N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), are probable human carcinogens. These two substances are known environmental contaminants and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products and vegetables. But their presence in drug products is not acceptable. We were deeply concerned when we learned about the presence of these impurities. We immediately undertook a major operation to investigate and to identify the root causes for the presence of these impurities in some ARB drugs, and to work with companies to address the risks that the impurities pose to patients. Our analysis of NDMA found that the risk to patients based on the maximum possible exposure appears to be small. That doesn’t diminish our concern and our determination to find out how these impurities occurred in the first instance. We’re committed to implementing measures to prevent these impurities from occurring in the manufacturing process in the future. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that these impurities are not present in finished drug products, or their components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API). There remains a great deal of public interest in this matter. Today, we want to provide an update on this ongoing investigation and outline the steps we’ve taken to identify the root causes of the nitrosamine impurities and to prevent a recurrence of this episode in the future. This continues to be an exhaustive effort led by a multidisciplinary team of chemists, toxicologists, physicians, pharmacists, communication specialists, investigators and analytical laboratory staff from across the FDA and in collaboration with global regulators. While we’re still investigating the root causes of the impurities, our ongoing effort has determined that the impurities may be generated when specific chemicals and reaction conditions are present in the manufacturing process of the drug’s API, and may also result from the reuse of materials, such as solvents. This issue surfaced in the summer of 2018, when the FDA was informed that API manufactured by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (ZHP), in Linhai, Taizhou Zhejiang China for some generic valsartan-containing medicines contained NDMA, posing a potential safety concern. Since then, the FDA and additional manufacturers of other ARB medicines have identified more cases of NDMA impurities, as well as NDEA impurities. We’ve placed a ZHP facility on import alert to stop all its API and finished drugs made using ZHP’s API from legally entering the U.S. We also issued them a warning letter outlining several manufacturing violations, including impurity control, change control and cross contamination from one manufacturing process line to another. It’s unlikely that the subtle problems causing these impurities could have been found on a routine current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) inspection. Nonetheless, our inspections did reveal systemic problems of supervision that could have created the conditions for quality issues to arise. We’ve also worked with manufacturers of all ARB medicines to recall any product that poses a risk to patients. Because of the way API is distributed in the supply chain, one source of contaminated API can impact multiple products. As part of this continuing process, last week, we alerted patients and health care professionals to a voluntary recall of one lot of irbesartan and seven lots of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination tablets distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, a Prinston Pharmaceutical Inc. subsidiary. The recall is due to unacceptable amounts of NDEA in the irbesartan API manufactured by ZHP. We will continue to keep the public updated via our of all products being recalled. While we acted aggressively to address the issue once we became aware of it, we must also answer the critical question of, why weren’t these impurities detected earlier? We’ve also been asked whether the FDA could have prevented this from occurring if we had done something differently during surveillance inspections in the preceding years. We want to lay out the many steps we take to mitigate these kinds of risks. We engage experts in organic chemistry to detect circumstances that can create the risk for these kinds of impurities to be introduced as a by-product of the manufacturing process or changes made in that process. We also work with international regulators to create standards for mitigating the risk of this type of chemical impurity, known as a “genotoxic” impurity. These chemicals, including NDMA and NDEA, are of special concern to global regulators because, unlike most impurities in drugs, they have the potential to cause harm at very low levels. That’s why we have robust policies and procedures in place to guard against these risks. In March 2018, the FDA issued a for manufacturers that lays out risk assessments that manufacturers can use to evaluate the presence of genotoxic impurities. This is an internationally-harmonized guidance that regulators and industry have agreed to. The FDA reviews information on impurity testing in product applications and when inspecting facilities. Manufacturers must test for known impurities during their manufacturing processes. We review information about potential impurities that can occur during manufacturing in applications, including requests that sponsors submit to change some aspects of the manufacturing process, which could create new risks. Specifically, our chemists review applications and referenced information to look for steps and changes where risks could be introduced. To implement a risk assessment for any genotoxic impurity, there must be recognition that it can occur in a product’s manufacturing. The guidance lays out the conditions under which these risks can occur and steps that manufacturers should take to test for these potential impurities. Now that we’ve uncovered the risk of nitrosamine impurities in the manufacturing steps involved in ARBs, we’ll incorporate the findings into ongoing policy development. In addition to our policy work, the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities worldwide. Generally during CGMP inspections, we review the records that manufacturers must maintain regarding required impurity testing. However, the impact of this record review depends on manufacturers conducting appropriate tests that are capable of detecting the impurity. Tests are selected based on assessments of what impurities may develop as a result of the manufacturing process. In other words, it generally needs to be recognized that there’s a risk of an impurity occurring as a result of a manufacturing process to know the impurity should be tested for. Our investigation into ZHP’s process identified that a change made to the manufacturing process likely led to this impurity, and that the impurity went undetected by global regulators, including the FDA, for a period of time. Before we undertook this analysis, neither regulators nor industry fully understood how NDMA or NDEA could form during this particular manufacturing process. This is troubling to us and we know it’s troubling to the public. This concern is appropriate. Among other steps, we need to take actions that would prevent a similar situation from occurring. We are making important strides at understanding how these impurities occurred, mitigating the risk to patients and learning what steps need to be taken to prevent this from occurring again in the future. One challenge we’ve faced is that NDMA’s properties make it hard to detect in standard laboratory testing – the kind of testing results that are reviewed during a surveillance inspection. In St. Louis, the FDA maintains one of the most advanced pharmaceutical laboratories of any regulatory agency in the world. As soon as we became aware of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in certain ARB medicines, we began collecting samples of all ARB API and medicines marketed in the U.S. to test these products specifically for NDMA. More testing found NDEA, also a probable human carcinogen, in other valsartan products and other ARBs from different manufacturers. During this time, our scientists have developed and refined novel and sophisticated testing methods specifically designed to detect and quantify the NDMA and NDEA in all ARB medicines. We’ve shared these tests on our website to help manufacturers and other regulators evaluate these products as well. To determine if ARB medicines contain these impurities, FDA scientists developed three testing methods. These include the . These testing methods can be used for evaluating both drug substances (API) and finished drug products. Medicines that contain NDMA or NDEA above (see 12/19/2018 update) pose an unacceptable risk to patients, and ARBs that contain impurities above these levels are being recalled. We’ve also posted lists of products affected by the recalls. We’ll continue to update these lists as new information develops. And we’ll continue to work with manufacturers to ensure all affected products are quickly removed from market. We’re also working with API makers to ensure that they fix their processes and cease distribution of affected API. We know patients rely on these medicines. Part of our work throughout this process has been to mitigate and prevent shortages, where possible. Currently, valsartan products are in shortage, and we know that other types of products may fall into shortage soon. That’s why the agency has also evaluated safety data for NDMA and NDEA to determine interim acceptable intake levels for these impurities in the ARB class of medicines. While consumers should limit exposure to NDMA and NDEA, these impurities exist in other ingested products, such as some charcoal grilled food items. And so, our goal is to balance the risk of patients ingesting low levels of the impurities (below the interim acceptable levels) for a short period of time with the risk that there is a shortage of certain ARBs, which may impact patients’ ability to access the medicine they need. We remind patients taking these medications or any recalled ARB to continue taking their current medicine until their pharmacist provides a replacement or their doctor provides an alternative treatment option. It also is important to know not all ARBs contain NDMA or NDEA, so pharmacists may be able to provide a refill of medication not affected by the recall, or doctors may prescribe a different medication that treats the same condition. Overall, the risk to individual patients remains very small, although this doesn’t diminish the significance of this episode or our concerns. FDA scientists estimate that if 8,000 people took the highest daily valsartan dose (320 mg) that contained NDMA, for four years (the time we think the affected products had been on the U.S. market), there may be one additional case of cancer beyond the average cancer rate among those 8,000 Americans. The vast majority of patients exposed to NDMA through ARBs received much smaller amounts of the impurity than this worst-case scenario. Since not all ARBs are affected, it’s very likely that a patient taking an ARB for four years would not have always received one of the affected products. We’re still seeking to similarly quantify the risk from NDEA and plan to communicate our findings as soon as possible. Now that these risks are identified, we’re applying what we’ve learned to the evaluation of similar manufacturing processes where we now know these risks could arise. As part of this process, the FDA has identified specific factors in manufacturing processes that may contribute to the formation and presence of NDMA and NDEA. Through our investigation, we’re working to ensure that other manufacturing conditions don’t contribute to NDMA, NDEA, or related impurities in finished drug products. We’ll use the information we’ve learned about these impurities when reviewing applications, assessing manufacturing changes and conducting inspections. Now that they are aware that certain conditions result in the formation of nitrosamines, manufacturers using processes at risk for these impurities are expected to test for them to ensure that active ingredients and finished products are free of detectable levels of a nitrosamine impurities resulting in drug products that that are safe for patients. While the total exposure to these impurities for most patients was small, we are deeply concerned that patients were exposed to this impurity in the first place and that the presence of nitrosamines went undetected for a period of time. The potential for the development of genotoxic impurities during manufacturing processes is an area of intense focus. We’ll continue to improve our science and standards for detecting and preventing these risks. We’ll also continue to keep the public informed on our , which contains most current information. Patients and providers can also send email to or call 855-543-3784. We’re also encouraging submission of any information related to potential side effects to our The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on 2019 efforts to advance the development of complex generics to improve patient access to medicines", "date": "January 30, 2019", "contents": " As part of the FDA’s efforts to promote drug competition and patient access, we’ve advanced many policies aimed at making it more efficient to bring generic competition to the market. We’ve been especially focused on a category of medicines known as complex drugs. These are drugs that, by nature of their formulation, delivery systems or the complexity of their active ingredients, for example, are harder to “genericize” under traditional approaches. As a result, these complex drugs often face less competition. As a category, there are a number of complex drugs that are no longer protected by patents or exclusivities that would forestall generic approval, yet they continue to face no generic competition owing to the difficulty of developing generics. The agency has advanced many new policies to help promote generic competition to complex medicines once patents and exclusivities have lapsed, and we’re planning additional policy steps in 2019. To understand the challenges posed by complex generics, we need to go back to the pathway developed in 1984 under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. This legislation put into place the framework for generic drug review at a time when brand drugs were often simple small molecules requiring straightforward and reproducible manufacturing processes. They were generally easy to characterize and evaluate through traditional methods, including human bioequivalence studies. In many cases, a drug’s activity correlated directly with how quickly it got into the bloodstream and how long the drug stayed in the body, so it could have its intended effect on the anticipated site of action. In contrast, complex drugs involve cases where the drug is often harder to develop and manufacture because it has a complex formulation or complex active ingredient. In other cases, the drug acts locally on the tissue rather than through the concentration in the blood. This includes, for example, inhaled drugs that act directly on the lungs, a topical patch that is activated directly on the skin, or eye drops that act on the surface of the eyes. The therapeutic effect of these types of drugs does not necessarily correlate directly to the amount of drug in the blood, or it can be difficult to measure through the blood. They can raise other issues that make the traditional, metrics generally used to develop generic drugs harder to employ. In other words, it can be more difficult to meet the standards for generic approval. In 2019, we’ll advance additional policies to promote generic competition for complex drugs. Among other steps, we intend to issue additional guidance documents for developing specific complex generic drugs, as well as address categories of complex drugs that are hard to copy because of their complex formulation or mode of delivery. This will include the publication of a series of guidances to address regulatory and scientific challenges that make it generally more difficult to develop complex generics. As part of this, we intend to issue draft guidance with recommendations on establishing active ingredient sameness. In addition, we’re going to help advance the development of new analytical tools and in vitro tests that may provide additional accurate, sensitive and reproducible tools to support approval of complex generic drugs. Better tools can reduce complex generic drug development time and cost and can inform regulatory decisions. These are just some of the new steps that we’re going to be taking in 2019 to promote access to complex generic medicines. These new policy efforts are aimed at ensuring that we provide as much scientific and regulatory clarity as possible with respect to complex generic drugs. This focus is critical because, first and foremost, these drug products provide important therapies to patients. We believe that they’re also becoming increasingly important to the economic stability of the generic drug industry. Being able to “genericize” a complex medicine can be a high-value opportunity for a generic drug developer. Addressing the challenges related to complex generics, and promoting more generic competition to these medicines, is a key part of our , and the agency’s efforts to promote patient access and more affordable medicines.

{"title": "FDA approves first generic Advair Diskus", "date": "January 30, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first generic of Advair Diskus (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) for the twice-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged four years and older and maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mylan obtained approval to market its generic inhaler in three strengths: fluticasone propionate 100 mcg/ salmeterol 50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 250 mcg/ salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg/ salmeterol 50 mcg. “Today’s approval of the first generic drug product for one of the most commonly prescribed asthma and COPD inhalers in the U.S. is part of our longstanding commitment to advance access to lower cost, high quality generic alternatives,” said Janet Woodcock, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “People living with asthma and COPD know too well the critical importance of having access to the treatment they need to feel better. Today’s approval will bring more competition to the market which will ultimately benefit the patients who rely on this drug.” According to the , asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 26 million people are known to have asthma, about seven million of these people are children. is a progressive lung disease that makes it hard to breathe and may become worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and other symptoms. “The FDA recognizes challenges companies face when seeking to develop hard-to-copy complex generics, such as drug-device combination products, including when the drugs are incorporated into inhalation devices like this,” said Anna Abram, FDA’s Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Planning, Legislation and Analysis. “We are committed to advancing new guidance for sponsors to make the development of generic versions of complex products more efficient, and we’re prioritizing review of many applications covering proposed generic complex products for which a generic has not yet been approved.” Inhalers are known as “combination products” because they consist of a drug and a device. The development of generic combination products can be more challenging than, for instance, solid oral dosage forms, like tablets, and the FDA regularly takes steps to help guide industry through the process. The FDA recognizes the challenges companies face when seeking to develop hard-to-copy complex generics, such as drug-device combination products, including when the drugs are incorporated into inhalation devices. Under GDUFA II, individual companies can meet with the FDA as part of their pre-ANDA program to support their development of such complex products. The FDA also publishes publicly available guidance documents describing the steps the FDA recommends companies take to submit complete, approvable applications for various types of drug products. In 2013, the FDA issued a for proposed generic drug products referencing Advair Diskus, which, among other things, provides bioequivalence recommendations, as well as formulation and device considerations. Further, as with brand-name drugs, the FDA inspects manufacturing and packaging facilities for generic drugs to ensure that they are capable of consistently producing quality products. The FDA requires appropriate data and information to demonstrate that complex generic drug-device combination products meet the agency’s rigorous approval standards to ensure quality drug products that are as safe and effective as their brand name counterparts are available to patients. The most common side effects associated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder for the treatment of asthma include upper respiratory tract infection or inflammation, swelling in the back of the throat (pharyngitis), hoarse voice or trouble speaking (dysphonia), oral candidiasis, bronchitis, cough, headaches, nausea and vomiting. For the treatment of COPD the most common side effects are pneumonia, oral candidiasis, throat irritation, hoarse voice or trouble speaking (dysphonia), viral respiratory infections, headaches and musculoskeletal pain. The FDA continues to advance new policies to promote more generic competition for complex drugs. Recently, the FDA issued to help advance the development of generic transdermal and topical delivery systems. The agency also intends to issue an umbrella guidance to help generic drug developers address some of the most challenging regulatory and scientific issues that may be encountered during the development of complex drugs. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on the agency’s efforts to enhance the utility of the Orange Book to foster drug competition", "date": "January 30, 2019", "contents": " One of our key policy priorities is encouraging the timely development and approval of generics and biosimilars. Our efforts have helped foster competition in the marketplace with the ultimate goal of improving access to high quality, affordable treatment options for Americans and improving patient care. We’ve made significant progress over the past year advancing efforts that have helped to strengthen and streamline the generic drug review process – setting for generic drug approvals and tentative approvals from 2017-2018; providing scientific clarity and guidance to support the development of hard-to-develop complex generics; and calling out potential abuses of the system where companies were using tactics to delay market entry of generic competitors. We will continue to advance new efforts in the year ahead. Our aim is to enhance transparency, provide greater clarity and scientific guidance for generic drug developers, and support the availability of high-quality, safe and effective generic medicines. One of the most fundamental and crucial tools for generic drug companies in planning their development efforts is the FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations Publication (also known as the ). This is a list of drug products approved by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that includes patent and exclusivity information and identifies whether a drug is currently being marketed or has been discontinued. Maintaining an up-to-date Orange Book also serves many important public health roles. Among its many benefits, the Orange Book helps keep health care providers informed on what drugs are approved and available. Given the important benefits of a modern, up-to-date Orange Book, today we’re announcing several new steps the agency will be taking to ensure that the Orange Book provides the greatest benefit to patients and providers, and generic drug developers. We want to make sure it provides as much utility as possible to aid manufacturers as they allocate resources towards the development of new generic drug products. The first of these actions is a new draft guidance – . The guidance provides approved drug application holders with clarity on the specific categories and descriptions of the information they’re required to share with FDA on the marketing status for their brand and generic drugs and how to provide it in a timely and consistent manner. Having timely, accurate information about what drugs are being actively marketed helps provide transparency around circumstances where generic competition is lacking. It helps us also better understand circumstances where generic medicines are being approved, but not marketed so that we can better consider any policy reasons why this may be occurring. This guidance stems from the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which imposed additional reporting requirements on new drug application and abbreviated new drug application holders regarding the marketing status of approved drug products, including: notification of a withdrawal from sale; notification of a drug not available for sale; and a one-time report on marketing status for actively marketed drugs. The guidance identifies the required content for marketing status notifications, the recommended format for submitting these notifications to the agency, and the required timelines for their submission. In the coming year we’ll be taking other actions to enhance this important resource and clarify Orange Book processes. Specifically, we intend to issue draft guidance for industry, describing how the FDA evaluates therapeutic equivalence (TE) and assigns therapeutic equivalence codes, which are published in the Orange Book. We believe this guidance will increase transparency around the FDA’s policies and procedures related to evaluation and assignment of TE codes to support applicants submitting requests for therapeutic equivalence and help advance pathways for achieving pharmacy-level substitution of therapeutically equivalent drug products, including products approved under the 505(b)(2) pathway. We believe this will be particularly beneficial for those seeking to develop generic products for harder-to-copy complex drugs that often face greater scientific and regulatory challenges and thus often have less competition. For some of these drugs, the 505(b)(2) pathway may provide a more efficient development path and the agency is developing policy for how manufacturers can acquire a therapeutic equivalence rating to allow for full substitutability for products developed by this route. We also intend to issue a draft guidance to assist drug product applicants and approved application holders in using the Orange Book. The guidance will provide answers to commonly asked questions that we have received from these interested parties regarding the Orange Book. Separately, we’ll also be soliciting public comment on Orange Book use and potential enhancements, including a re-examination of what pharmaceutical patents should be listed in the Orange Book. For example, if a product has been approved for use in conjunction with a digital application, we plan to consider whether the drug application holder should be required to list any patents associated with this digital application. We want to hear from the public on the pros and cons of requiring patent listings in these and other circumstances. To take the case of the digital application, listing such patents could help generic developers to assess all intellectual property assertions related to the product that could potentially block generic entry and determine its approach to these patents. This could allow generic competitors to better assess which products they choose to develop and provide greater clarity as to the path to market. Making sure companies are sharing complete and timely information with the FDA helps us keep the Orange Book updated accurately and efficiently. We want the generic drug industry to be as competitive as possible to help ensure consumer access to more affordable medicines. But this market must also be sustainable – if regulatory burdens are too cumbersome or market entry too unpredictable, industry will limit their investment in certain products, ultimately undermining our goal of enhanced competition. This is why, in addition to taking action to enhance generic competition, the FDA must work to make generic drug development more efficient and predictable. In addition to our work to reduce approval times and to enhance the efficiency of certain aspects of the submission process for generic drug applicants, we are striving to provide the industry with increased transparency to provide greater certainty around timing of market entry and enable more informed decisions on how to prioritize their resources. The steps we’re taking in relation to the Orange Book are only one component of these transparency initiatives and we look forward to continuing to provide updates on additional steps in the coming year.

{"title": "FDA warns patients and doctors about recall of home-use test strips used with device to monitor blood thinner warfarin, not authorized for sale in U.S.", "date": "February 01, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today is warning patients and doctors, who use at-home or in-the-office medical devices to monitor levels of the blood thinner warfarin, that certain test strips used with the devices may provide inaccurate results and should not be relied upon to adjust the drug dosage. Medical product distributor Terrific Care/Medex Supply LLC issued a of certain Roche Diagnostics test strip lots used with CoaguChek test meter devices last month. Today, the FDA classified this action as a , the most serious type of recall, which means use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. This recall is related to the November 2018 , the manufacturer of CoaguChek meters and test strips. The previous recall conducted by Roche, which is still in effect, involved more than 1.1 million packages of CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips that were distributed nationwide from Jan. 12, 2018 to Oct. 29, 2018. The CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips announced in today’s recall were manufactured by Roche, but distributed by Terrific Care/Medex Supply and include catalog numbers that were not included in the recent Roche recall because these strips were not labeled or authorized for sale in the U.S. and were only distributed by Roche Diagnostics outside the country. Terrific Care/Medex Supply purchased the Roche test strips from an unknown source and imported and sold them in the U.S. “Monitoring warfarin dosing is a critical part of using the drug properly to prevent and treat blood clots. Using faulty strips can lead to errors in medication dosage that could cause serious harm or death in some patients. That’s why it’s so concerning that this distributor continued to sell these test strips in the U.S. even though domestic sales had been stopped due to safety concerns. To reduce risks to patients, we’re warning health care providers and the public about the dangers associated with this product,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Distributing products that are not labeled or authorized for sale in the United States raises significant concerns for us in view of the serious safety issues with these test strip devices, and our work on this matter is not finished. Our top priority is the immediate safety of patients, and we’re taking steps to ensure the products that this company distributed are removed from the market.” As with the previous recall, the FDA is warning patients and health care professionals that they should not rely on these test meter devices to monitor warfarin levels if they’re using test strips affected by the recall. Instead, they should have blood drawn from a vein and have their levels measured by a laboratory test or use an alternative meter device. Millions of Americans take the blood thinner warfarin (also known by the brand names Coumadin and Jantoven) to prevent and treat blood clots. The drug may be prescribed for patients with certain types of irregular heartbeats, blood clots in the legs or lungs, or certain medical device implants such as artificial heart valves. Achieving the correct warfarin dosage is crucial, and patients need regular monitoring to test how long it takes their blood to clot. The response is measured by a blood test to check the International Normalized Ratio, or INR. This test can be performed by an accredited laboratory on blood drawn from a vein or with a fingerstick blood draw using an INR test meter at home or in a doctor’s office. concerning the CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips was based on medical device reports submitted by Roche Diagnostics to the agency indicating that the test strips may provide results that are higher than the actual INR. As a result of incorrect INR results, some patients may be prescribed an insufficient warfarin dose or instructed to interrupt warfarin use, which may increase the risk for dangerous blood clots. Incorrect INR results are of particular concern for individuals at an increased risk of blood clots including those with mechanical heart valves, with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) who are at a high risk of stroke, or those who had a recent blood clot. It is important to note that problems with the CoaguChek XS PT test strips are not likely to be evident to the patient. The test strips are used with the CoaguChek XS plus, CoaguChek XS Pro, CoaguChek XS professional, CoaguChek XS PST and CoaguChek Vantus test meter devices. Patients and health care providers who are using CoaguChek meters should immediately stop using test strips purchased from Terrific Care/Medex Supply and use an alternative test method. All health care providers, patients and caregivers, are strongly encouraged to voluntarily report INR test meter problems directly to the FDA through . Problems should be reported whenever one suspects that there may be an issue with an INR test meter such as a malfunction or incorrect result, or that the meter caused or contributed to a serious injury or death. The FDA is committed to continuing to communicate publicly on this issue and will provide updates related to this recall when available.

{"title": "FDA approves first therapy for the treatment of adult patients with a rare blood clotting disorder", "date": "February 06, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Cablivi (caplacizumab-yhdp) injection, the first therapy specifically indicated, in combination with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), a rare and life-threatening disorder that causes blood clotting. “Patients with aTTP endure hours of treatment with daily plasma exchange, which requires being attached to a machine that takes blood out of the body and mixes it with donated plasma and then returns it to the body. Even after days or weeks of this treatment, as well as taking drugs that suppress the immune system, many patients will have a recurrence of aTTP,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Cablivi is the first targeted treatment that inhibits the formation of blood clots. It provides a new treatment option for patients that may reduce recurrences.” Patients with aTTP develop extensive blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cut off oxygen and blood supply to the major organs and cause strokes and heart attacks that may lead to brain damage or death. Patients can develop aTTP because of conditions such as cancer, HIV, pregnancy, lupus or infections, or after having surgery, bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy. The efficacy of Cablivi was studied in a clinical trial of 145 patients who were randomized to receive either Cablivi or a placebo. Patients in both groups received the current standard of care of plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy. The results of the trial demonstrated that platelet counts improved faster among patients treated with Cablivi, compared to placebo. Treatment with Cablivi also resulted in a lower total number of patients with either aTTP-related death and recurrence of aTTP during the treatment period, or at least one treatment-emergent major thrombotic event (where blood clots form inside a blood vessel and may then break free to travel throughout the body).The proportion of patients with a recurrence of aTTP in the overall study period (the drug treatment period plus a 28-day follow-up period after discontinuation of drug treatment) was lower in the Cablivi group (13 percent) compared to the placebo group (38 percent), a finding that was statistically significant. Common side effects of Cablivi reported by patients in clinical trials were bleeding of the nose or gums and headache. The prescribing information for Cablivi includes a warning to advise health care providers and patients about the risk of severe bleeding. Health care providers are advised to monitor patients closely for bleeding when administering Cablivi to patients who currently take anticoagulants. The FDA granted this application designation. Cablivi also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Cablivi to Ablynx.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. on new programs to promote the adoption of innovations in drug manufacturing that can improve quality and lower drug costs", "date": "February 13, 2019", "contents": " Ensuring the safety of our nation’s drug supply is a cornerstone of our consumer protection mission. One of the fundamental elements of overseeing the quality and safety of pharmaceuticals is having a clear understanding of the specific processes and technologies used to manufacture drugs throughout their lifecycle. This starts before a product is even approved and brought to market, with the FDA’s premarket (or preapproval) review of drug applications. This includes a careful review of information about product and manufacturing quality, as well as, in many cases, premarket inspections of a company’s intended manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practices and other regulations. Overseeing how drugs are produced is a key component of ensuring the quality and safety of these products. One way we can support efficiency in drug development and the FDA’s oversight of drug quality is by recognizing a set of agreed-upon “voluntary consensus standards” related to pharmaceutical quality to take advantage of collaborative efforts between regulators, industry and academia that have resulted in nationally and internationally accepted standards for drug quality. That’s why today we’re announcing a new draft guidance, . The guidance proposes a program in which stakeholders and FDA staff will have the opportunity to propose pharmaceutical quality standards for potential recognition by the FDA, providing industry with additional options for pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. The overall goal of this program is to promote development and appropriate use of consensus standards to help expedite pharmaceutical development and streamline the review of drug product applications. By providing a list of recognized standards on our website, we will provide transparency regarding our thinking on a particular standard, which will help industry compile information for applications, can streamline the FDA’s assessment and allow us to focus our efforts on developing guidance on other quality topics. Our recognition of a standard may also reduce regulatory uncertainty, allowing applicants and manufacturers to utilize new or innovative approaches within their development programs. Once we’ve recognized a standard, applicants will generally not have to validate the approach outlined in the standard and can instead focus on appropriate use of the method and the acceptance criteria. We’ll similarly be able to streamline assessment of applications that reference recognized standards. Our hope is that establishing this program will also encourage the development of standards for emerging technologies that can improve drug quality and reduce manufacturing costs. This includes continuous manufacturing. Informally recognized standards related to pharmaceutical quality will also be publicly available on our website. It’s important to understand this program doesn’t change the requirements of the law – it does not apply to standards that are already legally binding, such as provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the United States Pharmacopeia. But the proposed program will facilitate recognition of other standards concerning pharmaceutical quality to make the adoption of advances in drug manufacturing and application review more efficient; and encourage innovation in how drugs are manufactured. While this program is intended for all drugs, brand and generics, we know that it will have a positive effect in supporting more efficient development and production of generic drugs, which often operate under small margins compared to brand drugs. Creating efficiencies in generic and biosimilar manufacturing is an important part of our work to streamline generic and biosimilar development overall, to help spur competition in the prescription drug market as part of our It's also important to consider that the manufacturing of these products may evolve after they have come to market, as companies make updates and improvements to their processes. These updates can help improve quality and reduce costs. When these changes are made, it’s the FDA’s responsibility to review them to recognize and mitigate any risks that a manufacturing change might introduce. In doing so, the FDA is careful to strike the appropriate balance between understanding how these changes could impact product quality and ensuring that companies can swiftly and efficiently make changes to process that can increase production efficiency, bolster quality and ultimately, help increase competition in the marketplace. Another way we can support efficiency of drug development and manufacturing is through greater transparency and clarity regarding the agency’s thinking on quality standards from pre- to postmarket. Last year, the FDA published a draft guidance for industry titled, “ .” This guidance, developed under the , provides a risk-based approach to regulatory oversight of post-approval manufacturing changes. The framework in this guidance provides a mechanism for applicants to gain agreement with the agency on the established conditions (ECs) necessary to ensure product quality, and to facilitate post-approval changes to those established conditions with a level of regulatory oversight commensurate with the applicant’s knowledge about their product and manufacturing process. Examples of ECs can include manufacturing and testing facilities, and certain process parameters and specifications. Tomorrow, we’ll announce the details of a new pilot program to gain experience receiving, assessing, and engaging with applicants regarding proposed ECs (also referred to as “explicit” ECs). Once the ICH Q12 guideline is finalized and implemented, the use of ECs is intended to help reduce submissions of unnecessary postapproval supplement applications and encourage manufacturers to continually improve their processes using the agreed-upon ECs as their guardrails. This can help promote manufacturing innovations that can improve the quality and safety of drug manufacturing, and potentially lower the cost of finished drug products. We’ll continue to expand our efforts with established conditions and drug competition to help facilitate the development and marketing of safe and effective drugs for consumers. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. and Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas on findings from the agency’s investigation of the November 2018 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in California-linked romaine lettuce", "date": "February 13, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acted quickly to protect consumers from an emerging outbreak of O157:H7 linked to romaine lettuce by issuing a this past November and recommending that industry and retailers voluntarily remove the product from the market. It was critical to provide this advice because it was believed that contaminated produce was still in the food supply at a time when Americans were preparing meals to celebrate Thanksgiving. By removing potentially contaminated products from the market, health officials and industry were able to reduce additional illnesses. Evidence at the beginning of this outbreak showed that the genetic fingerprint of the pathogen obtained from patients impacted by the 2018 outbreak was similar to the strains associated with an outbreak previously linked to in 2017. With help from this historic information, our staff worked quickly to initiate traceback from points of sale through the supply chain ultimately to the farms where the romaine could have been grown. Investigators were able to narrow down the growing region to California based on trends in the industry. Moreover, the supply chain pointed to specific California counties. The traceback investigation identified multiple farms that may have been implicated in this outbreak. These farms became the focus of further evaluation. The FDA led a team of experienced federal and state investigators who were tasked with taking samples and inspecting these farms to try and find out where and how this outbreak happened. They collected samples of soil, animal feces, fertilizer, agricultural water and reservoir sediment. The CDC was able to find one positive match to the outbreak strain in the sediment of an on-farm water reservoir, used for irrigation, in Santa Maria, Calif. The investigation teams made numerous visits to leafy greens farms in various counties and growing regions of California identified through traceback. The outbreak strain of O157:H7 was not detected in any other samples collected during this investigation. On December 17, 2018, the farm with the positive match to the outbreak strain in the sediment issued a of romaine lettuce and other products -- including red leaf lettuce, green leaf lettuce and cauliflower -- that may have also been contaminated due to use of agricultural water from the on-farm reservoir. Given the critical nature of these activities, during the partial lapse in funding, the FDA and CDC continued work on this investigation. Thanks to this continued effort during the partial funding lapse, we were able to declare the – just over two months after it was first – once we were confident that contaminated product could no longer be available for purchase and there were no new illnesses linked to romaine from the implicated California growing areas. Even though the outbreak was declared over, the FDA’s continued. We wanted to understand the factors that allowed this outbreak to happen and provide information to help prevent similar outbreaks from occurring again. Today, we’re announcing the findings of this and our best hypotheses as to how this contamination could have occurred. In the case of the one farm with a positive sample previously referenced, the FDA believes that the most likely way romaine lettuce on a specific ranch on this farm became contaminated was from the use of water from this reservoir as agricultural water. It is believed that this water came into contact with the harvested portion of the romaine lettuce, since the outbreak strain of O157:H7 was found in sediment from the reservoir and in no other sampled locations. The water from the reservoir doesn’t explain how lettuce grown on other ranches or farms identified by traceback may have been contaminated. So, this one farm cannot explain the entire outbreak. As part of our investigation, we determined that the farm had a procedure in place to collect and test reservoir agricultural water for generic E. coli and to treat the agricultural water with a sanitizer before use. However, the investigation team noted the verification procedure records did not document that sufficient sanitizer was present to adequately reduce any pathogens present in the water when this water was used for direct contact with romaine lettuce at harvest, during postharvest handling, and to wash/rinse harvest equipment food contact surfaces. It’s important to note that the farm reported that it did not use water from the reservoir for the dilution of crop protection chemicals. It also remains uncertain how the outbreak strain of O157:H7 was introduced into their on-farm water reservoir. The finding of the outbreak strain in the sediment of the water reservoir is significant, as studies have shown that generic can survive in sediments much longer than in the overlying water. It’s possible that the outbreak strain may have been present in the on-farm water reservoir for some months or even years before the investigation team collected the positive sample. It is also possible that the outbreak strain may have been repeatedly introduced into the reservoir from an unknown source. The teams did find evidence of extensive wild animal activity, including waterfowl, rodents, coyotes, etc., and animal burrows near the contaminated reservoir. This likely warrants consideration as a possible source of the human pathogen found in the on-farm water reservoir. It is another factor that we will work with the farm to address. Additionally, adjacent land use including the use of soil amendments, or for animal grazing on nearby land, may have had the potential to be contributing factors. As explained in the , which provides the findings of the unrelated spring 2018 investigation into contamination that originated in the Yuma growing region, food safety problems related to raw whole and fresh-cut (e.g. bagged salad) leafy greens are a longstanding issue. The FDA and CDC identified 29 foodborne illness outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing (STEC) with a confirmed or suspected link to leafy greens in the United States between 2009 and 2017. STEC contamination of leafy greens has been identified by past investigations, traceback, observation and sample collection results as most likely to occur in the farm environment. To help ensure that leafy greens are safe and mitigate problems that might occur, it’s important to understand where leafy greens are grown and harvested and not simply the location of the business entity that shipped or processed the produce. It’s also important to be able to determine which farms and growing regions are responsible for supplying the contaminated product and the time frame when product was supplied. This information is crucial to the development of accurate public health messages to both protect consumers from exposure and empower retailers and consumers to take appropriate actions. The FDA continues to recommend that leafy green growers, buyer/shippers and retailers be able to trace product back to the specific source in real time and make information about the source, such as harvest date and standardized growing regions, readily available for consumers on either packaging or point of sale signs, or by other means. We’re pleased to see many companies in the leafy green industry take voluntary steps to quickly respond to our previous recommendations. We believe this is the best approach to be able to inform consumers should there be any future risks to public health. Our first goal is working with federal, state and industry partners on implementing best practices to try and prevent these outbreaks in the first place. But when outbreaks occur, without the ability to identify the growing region or specific suppliers of suspected shipments, the public messages issued by the FDA and other public health partners during recalls or outbreaks will continue to be -- out of necessity -- broad and likely to include farms and growing regions that may not be responsible for the contamination. We know more needs to be done and there is a shared sense of urgency around these efforts. The FDA recommendations based on this investigation are similar to, and reinforce, the changes recommended for the leafy green industry in the Yuma environmental assessment. We continue to strongly recommend that all segments of the leafy greens industry thoroughly review current operations, procedures, policies and practices taking into consideration the findings of this investigation report, the and other relevant FSMA regulations. Other available science-based information relevant to the reduction or elimination of human pathogens on leafy greens should also be considered. In addition, industry should make the necessary modifications to operations, procedures, policies and practices to ensure safe products for consumers and minimize the likelihood of similar outbreaks in the future. We’ll continue to work with industry to explore better ways to assure quick, accurate and easy access to key traceability information. The FDA believes that widespread industry adoption of existing and emerging technologies, which can be used to trace product from the field to the consumer in real time, is a critical piece of our ability to protect the public. In addition, the agency has already started special, microbiological surveillance sampling assignments for romaine lettuce that is grown for distribution throughout the country. If samples are found to be contaminated, the FDA will follow-up with the responsible farms and firms to assure that they remove contaminated products from the market. The agency will also work with responsible farms to determine issues and identify steps they can put in place to prevent contamination in the future. Advancing the safety of fresh leafy greens requires ongoing collaboration. We urge all segments of this industry, from farm to table, and our government partners to review the findings of our investigation and make necessary changes. We recognize and appreciate the efforts that the leafy greens industry has taken to date. But together, we also know more must be done on all fronts to help prevent future foodborne illness outbreaks. We remain committed to further strengthening the FDA’s food program and applying our food safety expertise as we work to better safeguard the U.S. food supply. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA authorizes first interoperable insulin pump intended to allow patients to customize treatment through their individual diabetes management devices", "date": "February 14, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the Tandem Diabetes Care t:Slim X2 insulin pump with interoperable technology (interoperable t:Slim X2) for delivering insulin under the skin for children and adults with diabetes. This new type of insulin pump, referred to as an alternate controller enabled (ACE) infusion pump, or ACE insulin pump, is the first interoperable pump, meaning it can be used with different components that make up diabetes therapy systems, allowing patients to tailor their diabetes management to their individual device preferences. Diabetes therapy systems may be comprised of an ACE insulin pump and other compatible medical devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), blood glucose meters or other electronic devices used for diabetes management. “Diabetes is a complicated disease that requires close monitoring and carefully tailored treatments. We’ve heard from the patient community that having the ability to customize their own diabetes management devices is important to them. Advances in digital health make more tailored approaches to diabetes care possible,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The marketing authorization of the first ACE insulin pump intended for interoperable use has the potential to aid patients who seek more individualized diabetes therapy systems and opens the door for developers of future connected diabetes devices to get other safe and effective products to patients more efficiently. Because the FDA’s action creates a new regulatory classification, future ACE insulin pumps will be able to go through the more efficient 510(k) review process, helping to advance this innovative technology. We’re committed to advancing new ways to accelerate the development of innovations that can improve patient care while strengthening our pre- and post-market tools for determining the safety and effectiveness of these new technologies. Nearly 10 percent of Americans are diagnosed with diabetes, which impairs the body’s ability to make or properly use the blood glucose-regulating hormone insulin. The interoperable t:Slim X2 pump works by delivering insulin under the skin at set or variable rates. It can be digitally connected to automatically communicate with and receive drug dosing commands from other diabetes management devices, such as AID systems, or, when not connected to other devices, the interoperable t:Slim X2 pump can be used to infuse insulin on its own. AID systems typically consist of a pump, CGM, and software to control the system. Insulin pumps to date have either been cleared by the FDA as stand-alone devices (class II, moderate risk devices) or approved by the FDA as part of a single, predefined diabetes management system (class III, highest-risk devices). Because the interoperable t:Slim X2 insulin pump is interoperable with other diabetes device components, the pump was reviewed through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for novel, low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, which outline requirements for assuring the accuracy, reliability, cybersecurity and clinical relevance of ACE infusion pumps, as well as describe the type of studies and data required to demonstrate acceptable pump performance. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. With the authorization of the interoperable t:Slim X2 insulin pump and the establishment of these special controls, the FDA’s action also created a new regulatory classification, which provides more efficient patient access for this type of device in the future, because future ACE insulin pumps that comply with the general and special controls can go through a more efficient premarket review known as The FDA reviewed interoperable t:Slim X2 pump performance data demonstrating that the device can dose insulin accurately and reliably and at the rates and volumes programmed by the user. The FDA also assessed the ability of the pump to communicate with external devices with appropriate reliability, cybersecurity and fail-safe modes. Risks associated with use of the interoperable t:Slim X2 pump are similar to other infusion pumps and may include infection, bleeding, pain or skin irritations (redness, swelling, bruising, itching, scarring or skin discoloration). Other risks can include blockages and air bubbles in the tubing, which can affect drug delivery. Risks that could result from incorrect drug delivery include low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) and a dangerous rate of fat metabolization that may make the blood slightly acidic (diabetic ketoacidosis). Risks associated with connected ACE insulin pumps can include incorrect drug delivery as a result of loss of communication between devices, such as the pump misunderstanding commands it receives, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the t:Slim X2 insulin pump with interoperable technology to Tandem Diabetes Care Inc.

{"title": "FDA issues warning letter to doctor for illegally marketing unapproved device with claims to prevent and treat tightening of scar tissue around breast implants", "date": "February 14, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to Mark Berman, M.D., of Beverly Hills, California, for illegally marketing an unapproved implantable device, the Pocket Protector, that Dr. Berman claims can prevent and treat a complication of breast implants known as capsular contracture, or tightening of scar tissue. The warning letter also notifies Dr. Berman of significant deviations from the FDA’s quality system requirements and current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs), including deviations from manufacturing processes intended to keep implants sterile. “Advancing and protecting women’s health is a priority for the FDA. As part of these efforts, we will not tolerate bad actors who take advantage of patients by marketing unapproved and potentially unsafe products that deceive patients and put them at risk,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “This is not the first time the FDA has notified Dr. Berman concerning his illegal marketing of unapproved medical products and potentially putting his patients at significant risk. Dr. Berman is well aware that the FDA has never approved any product to prevent or treat capsular contracture. By illegally manufacturing and marketing this device, Dr. Berman is taking advantage of patients and exposing them to a broad range of unknown health risks, including not effectively preventing capsular contracture as the product claims or causing additional harm such as infection or adverse reactions with the breast implant. We’ll continue our efforts to protect patients from those individuals who choose to skirt laws intended to keep patients safe and sell unproven and potentially unsafe medical products.” The warning letter issued today reflects the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of device safety, including device therapies unique to women. As part of the and the agency’s ongoing commitment to advancing women’s health, the FDA has warned the public when safety issues are identified, such as . The agency has also established the Women’s Health Technologies Strategically Coordinated Registry Network to provide more complete evidence in clinical areas that are unique to women, such as uterine fibroids and pelvic floor disorders. Capsular contracture is a known complication of breast implants. This condition occurs when the scar tissue around a breast implant becomes tight, sometimes causing deformity and pain. Severe cases of capsular contracture may require surgery. This usually involves removal of the breast implant and surrounding scar capsule, with or without replacement of the breast implant. Capsular contracture may be more common following infection, injury to blood vessels (hematoma) or fluid buildup under the skin (seroma). However, the cause of capsular contracture is not known. The medical device that Dr. Berman is illegally marketing to patients under the name the Pocket Protector, is a pouch made of two sheets of a type of expanded polymer bonded together by silicone rubber cement that is implanted as a lining inside the breast pocket during breast augmentation procedures. The agency has never approved any implantable device for use in preventing or treating capsular contracture. Such a device would require by the agency. Dr. Berman unlawfully marketed the unapproved product via a website and through promotional videos telling the public that the Pocket Protector was safe and beneficial for treating or preventing capsular contracture, even though the product has never been evaluated by the FDA for safety or efficacy for that or any use. In addition, the warning letter discusses the FDA’s recent inspection of the Pocket Protector manufacturing site, which appeared to be a multi-purpose room in the Dr. Berman’s office. The agency found the manufacturing site to be inadequate for the manufacture of an implantable, sterile device. Investigators documented evidence of many significant deviations from CGMPs, including unvalidated manufacturing processes, lack of control over the components used in production, and the lack of sufficient and validated product testing. These significant deviations could lead to serious patient harm, including the potential risk of microbial contamination. Additionally, the FDA noted that Dr. Berman had failed to establish a process for collecting, identifying and reviewing medical device reports of adverse events associated with use of the Pocket Protector, as required by FDA regulations. The warning letter requests that Dr. Berman immediately cease manufacturing and distributing the Pocket Protector. It also asks him to respond, within 15 working days from the date the warning letter was received, with details of how the violations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Any violations not corrected could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction, or prosecution. Separate from the violations noted in this warning letter, Dr. Berman’s marketing of other FDA-regulated products without FDA approval is currently the subject of a that was filed in May 2018. In that case, the United States is seeking a permanent injunction against Dr. Berman and his California Stem Cell Treatment Center to stop them from violating the law by marketing stem cell products without FDA approval. Health care professionals and consumers should report any adverse events related to treatments with the Pocket Protector product to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting program.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Janet Woodcock, M.D., on the FDA’s continuing efforts to maintain its strong oversight of generic drug quality issues domestically and abroad", "date": "February 22, 2019", "contents": " At the FDA, protecting patient and consumer health is our highest priority. Assessing and mitigating risks is at the heart of everything we do across our vast portfolio. Sometimes the actions we take are visible, like warning letters or recalls. At other times, our actions to protect consumers are less discernable, but equally vital. Analyzing and addressing potential risks is a complex effort based on data and grounded in science. These activities are at the center of our consumer protection mission and underpin our efforts to ensure the quality and safety of medical products. Recently, there have been reports in the press calling into question the quality of our nation’s drug supply and specifically, asserting that certain generic drugs are of a lesser quality than brand drugs. Some of these reports claim to be based on data analysis. We believe these interpretations are seriously flawed and do not account for the full picture of our global vigilance over generic drug manufacturing. Today, we want to explain some of the fundamental steps we take to protect the quality and effectiveness of generic medicines that consumers and patients rely on every day and address what we believe are shortcomings in the analyses that have been performed by some news outlets. We recognize that our statement, in part directly responding to a news report, is not customary; we nonetheless feel obligated to provide a substantive response given the public health issues at stake. Consumers must have confidence in the safety and quality of generic medicines. Generic drugs provide affordable access to critical treatments. They are just as safe and effective as their brand counterparts and we stand behind the regulatory efforts that go into ensuring the safety and quality of all generic drugs. Our rigorous standards and inspections apply equally to generic and brand drugs – whether the medicines are being manufactured in Shandong, India, or Indiana. We welcome discourse about our process through public comment and a constructive dialogue with all partners and stakeholders, including the press. We welcome the scrutiny of our programs. We welcome the accountability inspired by a free press. This dialogue is part of how we advance our public health mission. We also welcome here, the opportunity to lay out our case for our high confidence in our generic program. To address recent questions raised about the scope and effectiveness of our oversight of generic manufacturing, we’ve asked our teams of experts in pharmacovigilance, pharmaceutical quality, compliance, and enforcement to look into a few specific, critical observations that were made. Generic medicines use the same active ingredients as brand-name medicines and work the same way. So, they have the same risks and benefits as the brand-name medicines. The FDA’s generic drugs program conducts a rigorous assessment before a generic drug is approved to ensure generic drugs meet these requirements. In addition, the FDA conducts inspections of manufacturing plants, ensuring compliance with the agency's requirements on good manufacturing practices. The FDA’s staff also continually monitors brand and generic drug products to make certain the medicines at all levels of the supply chain, from active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to drug products being sold to consumers, are safe, effective, and high quality. In the event that reports of negative patient side effects or other concerns suggest a problem with a drug, the FDA investigates and, when appropriate, may require changes in how a medicine (both brand-name and generic versions) is used or manufactured. The FDA monitors many sources of data to ensure the safety and quality of generic manufacturing. One of the fundamental elements of overseeing the quality and safety of generic and brand drugs is having a clear understanding of the specific processes and technologies used to manufacture drugs throughout their lifecycle. This starts before a drug is even approved and brought to market, with the FDA’s premarket (or preapproval) review of drug applications, including a robust review of manufacturing information, which is a cornerstone of our current regulatory framework. This manufacturing information allows the FDA to perform a careful analysis and assessment of the drug product and manufacturing quality. We also, where needed, conduct premarket inspections of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practice regulations and other quality requirements before it is ever marketed. For generic drugs in particular, this includes all the assessment activities conducted by our Office of Generic Drugs as part of their multidisciplinary review of all generic drug applications. As a result of the FDA’s rigorous review of manufacturing information, many drugs are not allowed to be marketed because, based on our careful review and analysis, they do not meet the standards for approval. Before and after marketing of a drug product, manufacturers are also required to notify the FDA of any changes they make to their manufacturing process or facilities. Moderate and significant changes require a supplemental application to be submitted to the FDA and significant manufacturing changes require the FDA’s approval before the manufacturer can distribute the drug product. Overseeing how drugs are produced is a key component of ensuring their ongoing quality and safety. After marketing of a drug, we also maintain active safety pharmacovigilance, particularly to identify and evaluate previously unreported adverse events (more commonly known as side effects). In most cases, one cannot draw a causal relationship from adverse event reports alone. It’s also generally not possible to determine whether a particular manufacturer’s product is causing more adverse events than another manufacturer’s product, just from adverse event reports. Additionally, analyses of voluntary, spontaneous adverse event reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) – whether using the public database, or reports received through a public records request – cannot provide the actual rate of an adverse event (AE) for any drug. The FAERS database includes reports regardless of whether AEs are attributable to the drug (vs. an underlying condition, for example). Moreover, reports typically have limited information for fully analyzing causality. Numerous biases influence whether AEs are reported in the first place. For example, some patients and providers may have negative expectations about generic products, and there may be a bias to report AEs with generic products, particularly early during their marketing. The AE severity and publicity about a drug or AE can also influence reporting. Atorvastatin has recently been cited in some press accounts. Looking at this drug as an example, the FDA pharmacovigilance experts reviewed data from our FAERS database along with drug utilization data from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2018 and did not find evidence that any single generic atorvastatin was more likely to be associated with adverse events than another (or that any generic was more likely to be associated with adverse events than the innovator product). The FDA has no concerns regarding the safety or efficacy of any generic atorvastatin at this time, including the Mylan product which was cited in the recent press accounts. We are aware that AE reports in FAERS often refer to the brand name product and manufacturer (rather than to the specific generic products and corresponding manufacturers) as the “providing manufacturers,” and those reports can far exceed the brand products’ percentage of prescriptions dispensed when compared with generic products. But this is not surprising. This type of discrepancy has been noted before in AE reporting, and likely represents health care professionals’ familiarity with and use of the brand name. This mismatch suggests the identification of the manufacturer in these reports is unreliable. The differences in reporting among generic manufacturers are difficult to compare given the small numbers, known misclassification of product manufacturers in FAERS, and other biases. Additionally, reports typically involve more than one product, and other comorbidities, which makes drawing a causal relationship to one particular manufacturer very difficult. So, how does the FDA identify and track potential safety signals with a specific drug? When the FDA investigates a possible drug safety concern, a multidisciplinary team reviews the data. Interpreting postmarket safety data is complex. It involves analysis of a wide range of information, including spontaneous reports of adverse drug events, controlled clinical trials and epidemiologic studies, electronic healthcare databases, estimates of drug usage and adverse drug experience reporting rates, estimates of background rates of the adverse events, the pharmacology of the drug in relation to the identified safety concern, and other relevant information. If a potential safety concern is identified in FAERS, further evaluation is performed. This might include conducting studies using other large databases, such as those available in the Sentinel System, which comprises payer claims data. Based on an evaluation of the potential safety concern, the FDA may take regulatory action(s) to improve product safety and protect the public health, such as updating a product’s labeling information, restricting the use of the drug, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, removing a product from the market. The FDA maintains global vigilance through a risk-based inspection strategy to focus inspectional resources on higher risk facilities and works closely with our international regulatory partners in Europe to avoid duplication of inspections. For instance, while surveillance inspections declined slightly in China from 2017-18, inspections in India have increased substantially. Among other things, the number of inspections in any given country reflects our risk-based prioritization of our inspections and improvements in our targeting; our increasing ability to leverage inspectional work done by trusted partners, especially in Europe; and a higher number of pre-approval inspections. Our policy for prioritizing and scheduling drug manufacturing inspections at higher risk facilities for quality-related surveillance is based on a facility’s compliance history, recall trends, time since last inspection, inherent risk of the drug being manufactured, processing complexity, and other factors, which are all carefully weighed and considered. When you look at the full force of our inspectional resources, the FDA is maintaining global vigilance by concentrating inspections on higher risk facilities. As global compliance trends change – and standards in some sectors improve – we should expect to see an evolution in these trends. While the numbers of inspections have varied over the past few years, compliance actions, including warning letters, have increased. Warning letters to human drug manufacturers regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) have steadily increased over the past four years. In fact, in FY 2018, CDER issued nearly five times as many warning letters to human drug manufacturers as it did in FY 2015. But it’s important to note that we don’t believe this reflects a growing problem in drug quality. On the contrary, the FDA’s improvements to targeting inspections and in evaluating recommendations for enforcement action mean more attention is being given to higher risk facilities than ever before. By better focusing our inspectional resources on higher risk facilities, we can identify potential quality problems that have the most impact on consumers. Then, we can take appropriate action to address our public health concerns. Overall, our inspections find that most companies are in compliance with good manufacturing practices and other regulations. But the reality is that we’re looking in the riskiest places. So, we’re better able to spot problems and take action when needed. Our approach appropriately allows for companies to provide a plan for how they’ll address issues identified during an inspection, which encourages a culture of quality within manufacturers, supported by smart and efficient regulation. Findings from inspections are evaluated and classified according to a defined process agreed upon by the CDER and our investigators and staff in the field who work for the FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs (. Recommendations from field investigators are an important factor in the evaluation and classification process, but we also consider other important factors: the manufacturer’s prior inspection history; how issues identified during the investigation relate to the quality and safety of drugs being produced; the manufacturer’s response to the inspectional findings, including any proposed corrective actions by the manufacturer; and other factors that may arise. Final decisions about what action to take based on an inspections’ findings reflect a careful analysis of all relevant information. In the great majority of cases, (about 75 percent of the proposed surveillance inspection classifications from the field), experts in CDER concur with the inspection classification recommendation from the field investigators. Per the agreed upon process and procedure, CDER makes the final decision regarding the issuance of warning letters following an inspection. To guide this process, there are standards that we follow for classification and violations must meet a certain level to be classified as OAI, or “Official Action Indicated.” While one publicly visible measure of FDA action, it’s important to understand that warning letters are not the FDA’s only course of action with a manufacturer following an inspection. The FDA can also have regulatory meetings with companies; issue an untitled letter; conduct a follow-up inspection; and take other regulatory and compliance measures depending on the situation – and we often do much of this behind the scenes in the interest of patient safety, while also working to prevent potential drug shortages, for example. The FDA’s standards and inspections for generic manufacturers are the same around the globe. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, no matter where they’re located, are responsible for ensuring that high quality products reach U.S. patients. The FDA’s role is to provide sufficient oversight – through application reviews and inspections – to ensure that companies fulfill their responsibilities and to take appropriate action when they do not. In addition to our pre-market steps, this oversight also includes testing selected finished drug products and APIs after they’re on the market. This testing affirms that the potency, quality, and consistency of generic medicines meets the standards established for the specific drug. For example, the FDA labs tested 323 products from around the world – including more than 100 from India – to determine if foreign manufacturers had a higher incidence of product failure. All 323 samples met U.S. market quality standards using testing standards set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or submitted in marketing applications. We recognize that the U.S. market for pharmaceuticals has changed dramatically in recent years. In 1990, generic medicines only accounted for 33 percent of retail prescriptions. Today, generics account for 90 percent. Supply chains have also expanded globally. This has created new complexities, and new opportunities for novel risks. Our program has evolved to meet these new challenges, and we continue to implement policy measures to address emerging threats. By maintaining global vigilance over the generic manufacturing industry, in close collaboration with our international regulatory partners, we’re maintaining the quality of these medicines while helping patients and payers realize more of the benefits from high quality, low cost generics. We continue to take new steps to address the challenges posed by a global supply chain and encourage the adoption of new advanced manufacturing methods. These actions are key parts of our commitment to ensure high-quality manufacturing, and to make sure Americans have confidence in the quality of products in their medicine cabinets – regardless of where they were manufactured. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. 19 in FY 2015; 43 in FY 2016; 67 in FY 2017; and 94 in FY 2018."},
{"title": "FDA takes steps to help reduce risks associated with surgical staplers and implantable staples", "date": "March 08, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to alert them that the agency is aware of an increasing number of medical device reports associated with the use of surgical staplers for internal use and implantable surgical staples—common devices used in many surgeries—and to provide updated recommendations to help reduce risks associated with their use. The letter also includes information about additional actions the agency is planning in the coming months to address the devices’ safety, including issuing a draft guidance with labeling recommendations for manufacturers and holding a public advisory committee meeting to discuss whether the current pathway for manufacturers to market surgical staplers for internal use is appropriate. “As part of our public health mission, it is important that we communicate with the public when we become aware of issues stemming from the use, or misuse, of medical devices,” said William Maisel, M.D., M.P.H., chief medical officer in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “As part of our Medical Device Safety Action Plan, we are committed to streamlining and modernizing how we implement post-market actions to address device safety issues to make our responses to risks more timely and effective. The agency’s analysis of adverse events associated with surgical staplers and implantable staples is ongoing, but we know these devices provide important benefits for patients undergoing surgery, so it’s important for us to continue to educate providers about the devices’ safety and risk. We are asking providers to be aware of the new information and implement the recommendations we’re outlining today to help improve the safe use of these devices. Improving the safety of surgical staplers and implantable staples is a top priority for the FDA, and we believe our forthcoming draft guidance to industry and planned advisory committee meeting will advance those efforts.” Surgical staplers and staples may be indicated for use in a wide range of surgical applications, including gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and thoracic surgeries to remove part of an organ, to cut through organs and tissues, and to create connections between structures. These devices facilitate surgical procedures and may shorten surgical procedure time compared to manual suturing. Currently, surgical staplers are regulated as medical devices, which do not require a premarket submission to the FDA. Implantable surgical staples are classified as Class II medical devices and require premarket review before marketing. The agency has previous communications about the risks involved with surgical staplers and implantable staples and has been conducting an ongoing assessment of medical device reports (MDRs) filed with the agency. The agency’s analysis shows that from January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018, the FDA received more than 41,000 individual MDRs for surgical staplers and staples for internal use, including 366 deaths, more than 9,000 serious injuries, and more than 32,000 malfunctions. The FDA continues to evaluate the MDRs for these devices. The most commonly reported problems in these adverse event reports include an opening of the staple line or malformation of staples, misfiring, difficulty in firing, failure of the stapler to fire the staple, and misapplied staples (e.g., user applying staples to the wrong tissue or applying staples of the wrong size to the tissue). Stapler and/or staple malfunctions or misuse may result in prolonged surgical procedures or unplanned, additional surgical interventions, which may lead to other complications such as bleeding, sepsis, tearing of internal tissues and organs, increased risk of cancer recurrence, and death. In today’s communication, the FDA is reminding providers to review labeling instructions and indications for use for surgical staplers and implantable staples, such as choosing the appropriate staple size for the patient’s tissue type and thickness. The letter to health care providers also suggests considering alternative options if the patient’s tissues are swollen, prone to bleeding, or dead (necrotic). The FDA further provides recommendations on how to recognize and manage device malfunction. For patients, it is important to understand that when used correctly, surgical staplers and staples can be beneficial surgical tools. These devices are regularly used in many types of surgical cases, and enable a surgeon to perform a less invasive operation, which may reduce postoperative pain and shorten recovery time. The types of adverse events observed with surgical staplers and staples may similarly occur with hand sewn alternatives. The purpose of the letter to health care providers is to remind them of the importance of appropriate selection and use of surgical staplers and staples to mitigate risk. In addition to the letter to health care providers, the agency is taking steps to address the safety of these devices. The FDA intends to issue a new draft guidance for public comment this year, which will describe proposed recommendations for manufacturers of surgical staplers and staples for internal use about information to include in their product labeling, which will help health care providers better understand the appropriate use and the risks of these products. In light of the identified risks of surgical staplers, the agency also intends to hold a public meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of its Medical Devices Advisory Committee this year to discuss whether the current pathway for manufacturers to market surgical staplers is appropriate. As part of the panel meeting, the FDA will present a comprehensive analysis of all the MDRs received for surgical staplers and staples for internal use, as well as other relevant information, and will seek panel input on whether reclassifying surgical staplers for internal use is appropriate. Reclassifying surgical staplers for internal use from Class I to Class II would allow the FDA to establish special controls, such as mandatory performance testing of various mechanical features, demonstration of usability and labeling comprehension (assessing user’s ability to properly select and use the device according to the labeling), and specific labeling elements supporting the safe use of the device. The FDA will announce the meeting, including details about how to participate, on the webpage and in a Federal Register notice at a future date. The communication issued today reflects the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of medical device safety. As part of the , the FDA has alerted the public when safety issues are identified, such as . The agency is also working with stakeholders to develop patient registries, including the National Evaluation System for health Technology, to provide more complete evidence in clinical areas to enhance the agency’s ability to identify and act upon safety issues with medical devices. As part of this critical work, we remain dedicated to closely monitoring reports of adverse events associated with surgical staplers and implanted staples. We will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available. We encourage patients, providers and health care facilities to report adverse events to , the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas on a new strategy to advance FDA’s food safety mission and modernize oversight of imported food", "date": "February 25, 2019", "contents": " American consumers expect a diverse, robust and fresh food supply that’s affordable and safe all year round. Since not all food products can be produced solely by domestic facilities, to help meet these demands, the U.S. imports about 15 percent of its overall food supply from more than 200 countries or territories representing about 125,000 international food facilities and farms. Over the past 15 years alone, we’ve seen a trend of rising imported foods. Other countries now supply about 32 percent of the fresh vegetables, 55 percent of the fresh fruit and 94 percent of the seafood that Americans enjoy. Even though we’ve seen an increase in imported foods, the safety of food products available to American consumers hasn’t waned thanks to the important roles that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the food industry and our regulatory counterparts around the world play in addressing the safety of imported human and animal foods. Whether produced domestically or abroad, a critical part of the FDA’s job is making sure all foods sold to American consumers meet U.S. food safety standards. This is especially important given the globalization of the food supply and steps the food industry has taken to meet consumer demands. The result is more complex supply chains and increased specialization, where a single manufacturer responsible for a single ingredient could find it in many different finished products. We work hard every day to ensure that the U.S. food supply remains among the safest in the world. One of the greatest advancements in our ability to better safeguard our food supply, has been the implementation of the FDA , which gave the FDA additional authority over importers and food producers sending products to the U.S. market and provided support for a level playing field between domestic and international producers. Optimizing our FSMA implementation activities, as well as our longstanding tools and authorities, will provide for an even more comprehensive approach to help ensure imported food safety. Today, we’re taking an important, new step to communicate how the FDA intends to use our modern toolkit by introducing a new, comprehensive, to address these challenges and opportunities. Our new strategy is designed to meet four important goals: preventing food safety problems in the foreign supply chain prior to entry into the U.S.; effectively detecting and refusing entry of unsafe foods at U.S. borders; responding quickly when the FDA learns of unsafe imported foods; and measuring our progress to ensure that our imported food safety program remains effective and efficient. To achieve our first goal of preventing imported safety problems prior to entry into the U.S., we’ll take new steps to continue to ensure that food offered for import meets the same standards as domestically produced food. One of our tools to achieve this goal is onsite inspections of foreign food facilities. These valuable inspections are resource-intensive, so our strategy will involve a more modern focus on tools for risk-informed prioritization of firms for inspection. Our decisions will be informed by an increasing amount of data and information from other oversight activities and partners. To that end, we also recently began inspections for the FDA’s . This program requires importers to verify that their suppliers are meeting U.S. food safety standards. Some key requirements under this rule include obligating U.S.-based importers to conduct hazard analyses, perform evaluations of the risk of the food and foreign suppliers, and conduct safety verification activities based on the identified hazards, including the use of third-party audits as appropriate. In addition, the FDA’s launch of the will aid the agency in meeting our goal of preventing imported food safety problems prior to entry into the U.S. This program provides a framework for audits of foreign food facilities to verify compliance with U.S. food safety standards, which can be used by importers to establish eligibility in the . The VQIP offers importers expedited review and entry of their food based on the safety assurances that the audits provide. The program also provides the FDA with additional data and intelligence that will help us plan oversight activities based on a more accurate assessment of risk. To advance our focus on preventive measures, the FDA’s new strategy also outlines how we’ll utilize a systems recognition program. Under this program we recognize that certain countries’ food safety systems and oversight activities provide comparable levels of public health protection to ours. In turn, these countries adopt a similar reliance on our systems and oversight activities. By relying on the activities of these reputable foreign regulatory programs, the FDA can avoid conducting separate inspectional oversight activities that are already by these foreign regulators with strong regulatory systems that are a part of the systems recognition program. By leveraging partnerships between the U.S. and other countries with very strong food safety systems through our systems recognition program, we’re able to prioritize our inspection and border screening activities on foods imported from higher-risk areas. In turn, we’re better positioned to verify the safety of food products presented for import. So far, Canada, New Zealand and Australia have been assessed and recognized as comparable under the systems recognition program. In addition, we’re currently working with the European Union on a mutual assessment. While we work to prevent problematic foreign food from reaching the U.S., we’re equally focused on our second goal -- detecting and refusing unsafe products -- by updating our import screening and review processes at the U.S. border. The FDA is charged with examining foods offered for import into the U.S., including high-risk foods. To accomplish this complex task, the FDA utilizes its Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT). This is an automated import screening tool that helps us to identify high-risk shipments of food offered for import. As part of our new strategy, the FDA intends to optimize this tool by incorporating new sources of data from foreign supplier verification programs, voluntary importer incentive programs, accredited third-party auditors, foreign regulatory authorities and domestic supply chain activities. This will allow us to form a more complete picture of the risk of imported food in a new era of smarter food safety. By enhancing our access to various data streams, we’ll be better positioned to catch issues with imported foods before they are made available in the U.S. marketplace. As we implement our first two goals, we must remain wise to the fact that, despite our best efforts to prevent and stop unsafe food from entering the U.S., it’s impossible to completely stop all unsafe food products before they hit our market. That’s why our third goal is focused on enhancing our ability to swiftly respond to unsafe imported food. To meet this goal, our new strategy describes how the FDA will use data from multiple sources to optimize use of physical examination and to develop strategic and targeted surveillance sampling that targets the highest-risk products for sampling assignments. This approach allows regular monitoring and surveillance of imported products, facilitates targeted assignments to collect data that informs oversight activities, and assists with verification of other related programs. We’ll also continue our work with state and other partners to determine how we can improve testing methodologies and tools used to determine admissibility of food offered for import. Further, we’ll capitalize on opportunities for improving the efficiency of our response to food safety incidents, for example by using mandatory recall authority, import alerts and improved information sharing with our regulatory partners as appropriate. Our final goal is to ensure that our import program remains effective and efficient and adopts modern tools to advance these purposes. We’ll be developing an improved global inventory of food facilities and farms to help optimize the FDA’s resource allocation for imported food safety oversight to areas of higher risk and help us strategically employ the full range of our regulatory tools as effectively as possible. To make our imported food safety program as efficient as possible, we’ll assess our performance of imported food safety activities and take additional steps to improve our performance based on those assessments. We’re already in the process of developing performance measures and outcome indicators for imported food safety and intend to publish our measures and non-confidential data about imported food, foreign suppliers, FSVP importers and other importers to the public as it becomes available. Overall, our modern strategy is designed to leverage our different authorities and tools to provide a multi-layered, data-driven, smarter approach to imported food safety. We recognize that the FDA plays an important oversight role in securing consumer safety. We’re fully committed to keeping our food safety mission robust and highly effective in this increasingly complex and global food landscape. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA issues warning letter to clinic illegally marketing unapproved thermography device, warns consumers to avoid using thermography devices to detect breast cancer", "date": "February 25, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a to Total Thermal Imaging Inc., of La Mesa, California, and its president and co-owner, Linda Hayes, for illegally marketing and distributing an unapproved thermography device as a sole screening device for breast cancer and other diseases. The FDA also issued a to warn patients that thermography is not cleared by the FDA as an alternative to mammography and should not replace mammography for breast cancer screening or diagnosis. “Advancing and protecting women’s health is a priority for the FDA. As part of these efforts, we will not tolerate individuals or companies who attempt to take advantage of patients by marketing unapproved devices that deceive patients and put them at risk,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “The FDA is concerned that patients will rely on unapproved claims that thermography may be used as a sole screening device for breast cancer and not get screened with mammography, which is proven to save lives by detecting cancer and prompting patients to seek appropriate treatment. People who substitute thermography for mammography may miss the chance to detect breast cancer in its earliest and most treatable stages. We’ll continue our efforts to protect patients from those individuals or companies who ignore the FDA’s requirements intended to keep patients safe.” Thermography is a noninvasive tool that uses an infrared camera to produce images that show the patterns of heat and blood flow on or near the surface of the body. Thermography has been cleared by the FDA only as an adjunctive tool, meaning it should only be use alongside a primary diagnostic test like mammography, not as a standalone screening or diagnostic tool. Total Thermal Imaging Inc. markets and distributes the Thermography Business Package, an unapproved device which includes a FLIR Systems Inc. thermographic camera and proprietary software, to individuals and clinics as a sole screening tool for breast cancer and other diseases. Such a device would require by the agency. Total Thermal Imaging Inc. illegally marketed the unapproved device via a website and promotional materials claiming that its device can enable the early detection or the diagnosis of many disorders including breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer, pre-stroke, heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and other diseases. In addition, the warning letter discusses the FDA’s recent inspection of Total Thermal Imaging Inc. in which investigators observed several significant deviations from the agency’s quality systems regulations, such as failure to establish procedures for taking corrective or preventive actions to address any defective products and failure to establish procedures for receiving and evaluating complaints (including a procedure for determining whether a complaint should be submitted to the FDA as a medical device report). The warning letter requests that Total Thermal Imaging Inc. immediately cease distributing the Thermography Business Package. It also asks the firm to respond, within 15 working days from the date the warning letter was received, with details of how the violations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Any violations not corrected could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction or civil money penalties. This warning letter is not the first time the FDA has cited firms for illegally marketing and promoting thermographic devices. In a safety communication issued today warning patients against using thermography, the FDA lists five warning letters issued to manufacturers for marketing unapproved thermographic devices and/or making misleading claims about thermography. As noted in the safety communication, there is no valid scientific data to show that thermographic devices, when used on their own or with another diagnostic test, are an effective screening tool for any medical condition, including the early detection of breast cancer or other diseases and conditions. The agency stresses that mammography is the only screening method proven to reduce deaths from breast cancer through early detection. The FDA ensures that mammography facilities follow FDA-required quality standards through the agency’s The warning letter and safety communication issued today reflect the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of medical device safety, including diagnostic and therapeutic devices unique to women.

{"title": "FDA, CDC, and CMS launch task force to help facilitate rapid availability of diagnostic tests during public health emergencies", "date": "February 26, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the launch of the . This task force has been created to help leverage the expertise of each agency to advance rapid development and deployment of diagnostic tests in clinical and public health laboratories during public health emergencies. “Public health emergencies, like Ebola outbreaks, remind us that we’re a global community when it comes to public health protection. Bacteria and viruses don’t respect territorial boundaries. It takes a sustained, robust and globally coordinated effort to protect our nation and the global community from various infectious disease threats. We’re all in this together. To that end, the FDA knows that collaborating with our federal partners to employ our collective expertise, experiences from previous incidents, and resources will better assist in a global response. We also believe that this task force could lead to more innovation for diagnostic tests as developers will see a more predictable federal regulatory response through the agencies’ coordination,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This task force will help our agencies better collaborate to prepare for, and respond to, public health threats, including identifying threats and ensuring the appropriate diagnostics are in place to support efforts in the field.” The FDA, CDC and CMS each play a critical role in responding to public health emergencies, including identifying threats, regulating medical products, and providing oversight for laboratories. The agencies have robust teams of scientists, researchers and policy experts that are dedicated to preparing the U.S. for rapid disaster response. Diagnostic tests—such as those that can detect pathogens like the Ebola and Zika viruses—can be quickly made available to meet response needs during a crisis through the process. The FDA has authority to issue an EUA for the use of diagnostic tests during public health emergencies, provided criteria are met. The CDC is responsible for providing agent-specific subject matter expertise in epidemiology, laboratory expertise and guidance to clinicians and laboratories responding to the emergency. The CDC and other federal laboratories are often the ones developing new tests to respond to emergency needs. CMS has authority to ensure quality testing at laboratories through the (CLIA). CMS provides guidance, even during public health emergencies, to laboratories on meeting CLIA requirements to ensure laboratories produce accurate, reliable and timely results. Prior to this partnership, feedback from the clinical laboratory community indicated that there was uncertainty about how to implement the diagnostic tests once they received an EUA; particularly, the community was uncertain about meeting CLIA regulations under an EUA to allow labs to start testing specimens. “During public health emergencies, ensuring the health and safety of patients through quality laboratory testing will remain the focus of CMS,” said Kate Goodrich, director of the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality and CMS Chief Medical Officer. “Timely implementation of EUA diagnostic assays in the US healthcare system is dependent upon laboratories understanding the instructions for use and applying them to the patient samples received for testing. As part of this taskforce, it is our goal to provide clear and consistent guidance to laboratories on the application of CLIA requirements for these emergency assays.” By standardizing collaboration efforts, the federal partners hope to address issues related to implementation of diagnostic tests authorized for emergency use under an EUA, as well as other unmet needs and gaps in preparing and responding to global health threats. The task force will provide a forum for each agency to coordinate, provide consultation, and improve the availability of diagnostic tests during public health emergencies. In addition, to assist in public health preparedness, the task force will work to define, refine and streamline interagency approaches for the implementation of EUA diagnostic tests. The hope is that the task force will enable an even more efficient federal government response for making diagnostic tests available in the event of a public health emergency. “Time and time again, we’re reminded that disease knows no borders. While our globalized world and modern transportation help promote economic prosperity, these features also facilitate the spread of emerging infectious diseases,” said Chesley Richards, CDC’s Deputy Director for Public Health Science and Surveillance. “In the past 15 years alone, we’ve faced serious global outbreaks of deadly pathogens. During public health emergencies, it is critical for diagnostic tests to be made available and adopted quickly into clinical and public health laboratories for rapid patient care.” The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. on the agency’s 2019 policy and regulatory agenda for continued action to forcefully address the tragic epidemic of opioid abuse", "date": "February 26, 2019", "contents": " The opioid crisis is one of the largest and most complex public health tragedies that our nation has ever faced. It remains the biggest public health crisis facing the FDA. The toll of addiction, in lost lives and broken families, touches every community in America. Sadly, the scope of the epidemic reflects many past mistakes and many parties who missed opportunities to stem the crisis, including the FDA. At the FDA, we’ve worked to learn from past mistakes, and we intend to make sure that we’re acting forcefully enough to address new threats that could extend this crisis. Addressing the opioid crisis is a top priority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the entire Administration. The FDA is a key part of that effort. We’re a deliberative, science-based agency. We calibrate our policy and regulatory actions carefully, based on rigorous evidence that can often take many months and even years to collect. This defines our gold standard for regulatory decisions. But given the scope of this crisis, and its human toll, we’ve committed to act more quickly as we confront new risks. We’ve changed our approach and are taking a much more aggressive approach to regulatory action. At the FDA, we’ve committed to taking more rapid action in the face of new threats, like the growing prevalence of illicit fentanyl that’s contributing to overdose deaths, or the continued prevalence of prescriptions being written for durations of use that are too long for the clinical circumstances for which they’re intended. We’ve changed the way we’re tackling these issues and stepped up our intervention when it comes to opioids. In this epidemic, waiting for the accumulation of definitive evidence of harm left us a step behind a crisis that was evolving quickly, and sometimes furtively, in vulnerable communities that were too often being tragically ignored. To address this crisis differently, and more definitively, we’ve taken decisive steps in recent years, and have additional actions already underway for 2019, with more steps planned to begin this year. We’re committed to getting ahead of this crisis. We don’t want to look back five years from now, at an even larger crisis, with regret that there were more aggressive steps that we could have taken sooner. All options are on the table. Addressing this crisis is one of the FDA’s top public health priorities. With this statement, I want to assess some of the steps we’ve taken and outline the new actions we’ll be pursuing. Prescribers have a critical role to play, and we must make sure they have essential information about opioids through drug labeling. In the fall, we expanded the extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements to the immediate-release (IR) opioid analgesics intended for use in an outpatient setting. We’ve also updated the boxed warnings in the labeling for these products to include information about the REMS. The REMS program was also expanded to require, for the first time, that training be made available to all health care providers, including nurses and pharmacists, who are involved in the management of patients with pain (in addition to doctors who prescribe these products). The content of the education was also broadened to cover information about acute and chronic pain management, safe use of opioids or other non-opioid or non-drug treatments, and material on addiction medicine and opioid use disorders. The FDA also developed new solutions to address the unique risks of opioids in conjunction with our request for the market withdrawal of Opana ER in 2017. We will, as needed, continue to take strong regulatory steps to seek to limit or curtail access to certain drugs, based on formally assessing the risks associated with illicit use, as we did in the case of Opana ER with the risk of intravenous abuse. As part of our effort to consider the risks associated with the illicit use of opioids as one component of how we assess the overall risk and benefit of these medicines, we also worked with Congress to secure explicit authority to take action, as needed, on the basis of a consideration of these risks. This authority was included in the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. In 2018 we also opened a dialogue around the potential for evaluating the comparative benefits and risks of new opioids relative to other opioids already on the market. Going forward we’ve raised the question of whether there should be such a standard for new opioid approvals to offer some advantage over the existing armamentarium. We raised this question in the context of the approval of the sufentanil product Dsuvia. We plan continue to evaluate this concept in questions that we’ll ask as part of a public docket alongside a draft guidance document that we’ll be issuing to modernize the FDA’s framework for assessing the risks and benefits of opioid drugs. To reduce the rate of new addiction we need to reduce exposure to opioids. This means rationalizing prescribing, which in turn means that not only must we take steps to make sure fewer prescriptions for opioids are written, but also that when these drugs are prescribed, it’s for a dose and duration of use that comports closely with the clinical circumstance and the medical need of the patient. This means no more 30 tablet prescriptions for a tooth extraction. To pursue these public health goals, we’re working with stakeholders like the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to create a scientific framework for developing evidence-based prescribing guidelines that provide specific recommendations on the proper dosing and dispensing of opioids based on specific clinical indications (like outpatient surgeries). This will help support evidence-based guidelines in areas where they do not currently exist. This report will be ready at the end of 2019. We’re also conducting a review of data from product applications, in collaboration with an academic partner, to identify where adequate evidence exists to inform new guidelines. We believe there are clinical circumstances where there’s already adequate evidence to create evidence-based prescribing recommendations, and we’ll pursue the development of these guidelines. In 2018, the FDA also continued work with other federal and state partners on numerous other changes started over the past several years to achieve more appropriate prescribing. Rationalizing prescribing practices by providers remains a cornerstone of our effort to reduce the rate of new addiction. And reducing the rate of new addiction is a key element of our overall approach to address this crisis. These combined actions across many federal, state, and professional entities are having an impact. Since 2015, the estimated number of opioid analgesic prescriptions dispensed from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies (which may be the most vulnerable to abuse or diversion of prescription products) have fallen by 24 percent. Notably, prescriptions of higher strength opioids (90+ morphine milligram equivalents/unit) have fallen even more steeply since 2015, accounting for less than 1 percent of all opioid analgesic units (e.g., tablets) dispensed in 2018. Although the appropriate use of opioids from prescription claims data cannot be determined, the risk of overdose has been shown to be intertwined with increasing dose and duration of opioid analgesic use. Overall, the estimated total number of opioid analgesic prescriptions peaked in 2012, to 260 million prescriptions from 145 million in 1997. The estimated total morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per prescription peaked in 2010, at 950 MMEs, before falling to 905 MMEs in 2015. However, the rate of overdose death continues to increase. This is due in part to the increasing abuse of potent adulterated or illicitly manufactured fentanyl products purchased through online channels and sold as street drugs. As the opioid crisis has evolved, so has the nature of the threat. Opioids are still too commonly prescribed and lawful prescriptions still contribute to the development of new cases of addiction. But illicit opioids are accounting for a sharply increasing fraction of the total exposure to these drugs, and fueling a growing addiction crisis. Within the scope of our work, we’re especially focused on illicit online purchases. The flow of drugs on the surface and dark web has become a significant part of the epidemic relative to prescription opioids. To address the evolving nature of this threat, since 2017, we’ve warned a total of 23 networks operating more than 450 websites for illegally marketing potentially dangerous, unapproved, and misbranded versions of opioid medications, including tramadol and oxycodone. Cutting off this illicit internet traffic is critical. We’ll continue to pursue all available means of enforcement to stop these online drug dealers. In 2018 we also took actions to increase our interdiction work in the International Mail Facilities (IMFs). Specifically, as the nature of this epidemic has evolved to encompass greater flows and use of illicit opioid drugs, we’ve expanded our enforcement efforts to include increased interdiction work aimed at stopping the illegal flow of counterfeit and unapproved prescription drugs, which in numerous cases includes opioids. The FDA expanded the capacity of import operations, made significant investments in our Office of Criminal Investigations, and our laboratories, including our Forensic Chemistry Center. These are important investments to help us identify and stop illegal drugs seeking to enter the U.S. including through the IMFs. Over the last two months, the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) have made significant progress to stop the activities of sophisticated bad actors who attempt to evade FDA enforcement at the border. Among these new steps, we’re pleased to report that we’re implementing one of the new authorities in Section 3022 of the SUPPORT Act related to restricting entrance of illicit articles containing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This new authority (new section 801(u) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) allows the FDA to treat illegal imported articles as drugs when they meet certain requirements—and stop them as needed—even in the absence of certain evidence of intended use. ORA has updated its IMF procedures to support implementation of this new authority to help prevent illegal drugs from entering our country. We’re also working on new tools to identify analogues of APIs that present s significant public health concern, to make sure that this important new enforcement tool against illicit drugs has its intended effect. The FDA will begin applying the new 801(u) authority to any imported product entering the U.S. via international mail which is labeled to be or contains, or is found through laboratory analysis to be or contains, any of the ingredients identified as presenting a significant public health concern. These new steps will make our operations in the IMFs more efficient and allow us to improve our interdiction work. By supporting appropriate opioid prescribing, education, and labeling we’re reducing excess quantities of opioid analgesics available for abuse or diversion and helping to reduce the rate of new addictions from prescribed opioids. By strengthening our enforcement and inspections of packages and entering the U.S. from abroad, we’re helping to staunch the trafficking of even more powerful and deadly drugs ( ) and address the changing nature of this crisis. By increasing the accessibility of medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and reducing stigma associated with it, we’re helping those struggling with addiction to return to lives of sobriety in their communities with dignity. These are just some of the domains that we’re working across as we address this crisis using all of our tools and authorities. We know we must treat opioids very differently than other drug classes, and Congress has supported us in that effort by granting us very specific new authorities related to opioids. These are just some of the steps that we took in 2018 to address this crisis. In 2019, we plan on taking new actions to build on these efforts, and also adapt our response to confront the changing nature of the threat. We’ll continue to aggressively and compassionately to address this tragedy. The FDA continues to have a critical and unique role to play in preventing cases of new opioid addiction – helping to reduce avoidable exposure to opioid analgesics and thereby reduce the rate of new addiction. We’re taking new steps to reduce exposure to opioid analgesics by helping to ensure that these drugs are appropriately prescribed, with dose, quantity and treatment durations that match the indication. Passage of the SUPPORT Act has provided the FDA with important new authorities to assist in our effort to reduce the risk of addiction and misuse associated with opioid analgesics. For example, the new law allows the FDA to require certain packaging be made available for opioids and other drugs that pose a serious risk of abuse or overdose if the FDA determines that such packaging may mitigate such risks. We plan to implement the initial steps to require unit of dose packaging in the first half of 2019. Specifically, the FDA is considering use of this new authority to mandate that certain solid, oral dosage forms of immediate-release formulations of opioid analgesics indicated for treatment of acute pain be made available in short-duration packaging for outpatient dispensing. Such packaging could reduce over-prescribing by giving providers a convenient option that contains only enough drug doses for up to a few days of opioid treatment at standard dosing. Our data suggests that for many acute pain indications where opioids are used, a day or two of dispensed drug is the appropriate quantity. Small quantities in blister packaging, that comport with evidence demonstrating that a day or two of medication is sufficient, could reduce the overall amount of dispensed drugs available for misuse, abuse, and diversion. The SUPPORT Act also allows the FDA to require manufacturers to develop disposal technologies (such as a mail-back pouches) to get unused medications out of medicine cabinets. This is another new authority that we’re prioritizing for work in the first half of 2019. We’re also taking new steps to consider a framework to allow us to formally evaluate each candidate opioid in the context of how a novel opioid might fit into the overall therapeutic armamentarium that’s available to patients and providers, and address the question we’re frequently asked as to whether new opioid drugs should offer some comparative benefit over existing drugs. This process could include seeking revisions to statutory authorities to allow us to change the weight we give to meaningful therapeutic differentiation for proposed new opioids, including relative safety or effectiveness advantages over existing treatments. We also plan to pursue new efforts to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of REMS programs for opioid products, including methods for data collection and assessment tools. Recently, we’ve heard concerns around the REMS program associated with one class of opioid products, transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) medicines, and whether the REMS program is working as intended. This is that was raised by the FDA as the focus of an August 2018 public advisory committee meeting. These products are medically important for a specific group of patients experiencing breakthrough pain that may not be managed by their around-the-clock opioid pain medicine. But these medicines also pose serious risks. That’s why the agency has sought to ensure that the TIRF REMS program is achieving its public health goal of assuring safe use and mitigating the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and complications due to medication errors. The agency has been actively assessing the recommendations of our advisory committee on the effectiveness of the REMS and necessary changes. Based on these recommendations, and our analysis of our own data, the FDA will soon share next steps, including modifications intended to strengthen the current TIRF REMS. The prescribing of the TIRF products has decreased dramatically from peak years in 2014 and 2015. Nonetheless, substantial risks remain if these powerful drugs are not used properly and in appropriately indicated patients. The goal of the changes we will make to the TIRF REMS programs will be to make sure the program is working to mitigate the known risks of these medicines and that these drugs are being prescribed only to opioid-tolerant patients, and that those patients understand the risks and how to use TIRF medicines safely. To help those suffering from opioid use disorder, the FDA is prioritizing new efforts to advance the development and use of safe and effective MAT. This includes new guidance aimed at supporting the development of novel medicines as well as novel medical devices such as digital health tools, advancing new policies to promote the adoption of safe and effective MAT, and working with partner organizations/stakeholders to reduce the stigma associated with MAT. Reducing overdose deaths also requires broadening the availability of naloxone. One potential way to improve access to naloxone is to make it available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale. FDA-approved versions of naloxone currently require a prescription, which may be a barrier for people who aren’t under the care of a physician or may fear a stigma associated with seeking access to the medicine or are fearful of admitting to issues with substance abuse. Having naloxone widely available, for example as an FDA-approved OTC product, would be an important public health advance, and a need that we’ve been working on at the FDA. To encourage naloxone manufacturers to enter the OTC market, the FDA took an unprecedented step of developing a model Drug Facts Labels (DFL) with easy-to-understand pictograms on how to use the drug. We proactively designed, tested and validated the key labeling requirements necessary to approve an OTC version of naloxone and make it available to patients. These steps put into the public domain much of the regulatory work needed to take naloxone OTC. One of the key components for OTC availability is now in place so that sponsors can use it to obtain approval for OTC naloxone and increase its access. These efforts should jumpstart development of OTC naloxone and promote wider access to this medicine. This year we are seeking to work with industry partners who are interested in developing these OTC naloxone products. Another critical part of our efforts for 2019 is new steps to promote the development of drugs to treat pain that are not addictive. To advance these goals, in 2019, we’ll be issuing updated guidance outlining the appropriate clinical endpoints and clinical trial approaches for the development of non-opioid drugs for use in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We’ll also advance new steps to promote the development of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids by exploring new methods for analyzing and evaluating abuse-deterrent features; further evaluating the nomenclature used to describe these abuse-deterrent features; and facilitating development of science for generic versions of these products. The FDA will continue to strengthen its enforcement activities that target those who unlawfully market or distribute illicit opioids and other unapproved drugs. We’ll step up our efforts aimed at the interdiction of opioids being illegally shipped into the United States and will continue to increase the number of investigators, both civil and criminal, in the IMFs. Among other new steps we’ll take in 2019, the FDA is working in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to expand information sharing and maximize each agency’s inspection and detection capabilities at the border to protect the public from illegal and potentially harmful products entering the U.S. This includes real-time sharing of data obtained by scientists using field-based screening tools to test samples that are seized at the IMFs and at the border. We’re working closely with our partners at CBP in this program. Right now, seizures of opioids like fentanyl are typically reported in pounds of drug product seized. But that doesn’t give a full picture of the total amount of drugs that are being illegally shipped into the U.S. because these weight-based measures don’t account for potency. Some of the drugs being illegally brought into the U.S. may consist of fentanyl premixes ready for pressing into tablets, while others are super-potent formulations of compounds like fentanyl. By additional testing to develop a chemical profile of more seized samples, we can develop a better picture of the illicit drug trafficking landscape, which can better inform our policy work. We’re also going to be expanding our collaboration with internet stakeholders to crack down on illicit drugs sold online. In April, we’re also planning our second Online Opioid Summit. The first Online Opioid Summit held last June initiated an open and candid dialogue with key internet stakeholders to discuss ways to take robust action to reduce the availability of opioids online. Since the initial Summit was announced, internet stakeholders have taken concrete steps to prevent the illegal sale of opioids through their platforms and services. Important actions came about as a result of this collaborative dialogue with key stakeholders. For example, Google now deindexes websites based on our warning letters that cite the unlawful sale of opioids to U.S. consumers. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram redirect users who are looking to buy opioids online to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration National Helpline. We look forward to the second Online Opioid Summit to build on these efforts with additional, innovative steps to protect the public from opioids that are illegally being sold via the internet. As part of the 2019 budget, the FDA also received $20 million to create a large-scale data warehouse to improve our analytic capabilities to better evaluate social and clinical trends that are affecting the trajectory of the opioid crisis. This warehouse can facilitate data analytics, including machine learning algorithms, to help better assess vulnerability points in the population through predictive analytics, identify early trends that may be contributing to the epidemic, and target early regulatory changes to address the changing opioid epidemic. Finally, as part of our effort to clamp down on illicit sales of opioids – which includes our work to close down illegal portals on the internet and expand our presence in the IMFs – we’re also doing more to secure the legitimate supply chain. This means doing more to hold distributors responsible for securing the drug supply chain. As part of this effort, we recently that the FDA issued its first warning letter under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) to . for violations highlighted by a concerning tampering incident that involved opioid medications. Under the DSCSA, manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers – which are mainly pharmacies – are all required to have systems and processes in place to quarantine and investigate suspect and illegitimate medications. These systems must be in place to respond rapidly to notifications of illegitimate products and to notify trading partners and the FDA when illegitimate products are discovered. The warning letter to McKesson outlines violations observed during that took place this past summer, including failing to: sufficiently respond to notifications that there was illegitimate product in their supply chain; quarantine and investigate suspect products; and maintain records of investigations of suspect product and disposition of illegitimate product as the law requires. This action is part of a broader policy effort to improve the security of the drug supply chain and prevent diversion of opioids. We’ll continue efforts to ensure manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers and others responsible for maintaining the supply chain are taking measurable steps under the law to appropriately track and trace opioid medications as these products move through the supply chain, and to respond to incidents involving illegitimate products to protect the public health. These are just some of the new steps we’ll advance in 2019 as we continue to confront this crisis. Looking back across modern times, this is perhaps the biggest public health tragedy ever created through the deliberate actions of people. The opioid crisis took hold over the course of decades of action and inaction. Now, its scope is so large, and so devastating, its toll is self-evident. It will, unfortunately, take years of aggressive action to reverse its course for good. We won’t lose our focus on this fight. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new device for treating moderate to severe chronic heart failure in patients", "date": "March 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the Optimizer Smart system for treating patients with chronic, moderate-to-severe heart failure who are not suited for treatment with other heart failure devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy to restore a normal timing pattern of the heartbeat. The FDA gave the device a designation because it treats a life-threatening disease, heart failure, and addresses an unmet medical need in patients who fail to get adequate benefits from standard treatments and have no alternative treatment options. “Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure have limited treatment options. And for those who are unable to be treated due to underlying conditions or who have not responded to available treatments, their quality of life may be impacted, with limits on the types of physical activities they can do,” said Bram Zuckerman, M.D., director of the Division of Cardiovascular Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA recognized the unmet need for these patients and worked with the manufacturer through our Breakthrough Device Program to efficiently bring this product to market, while ensuring it meets our regulatory requirements for safety and effectiveness.” About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment for heart failure includes treating the underlying causes and reducing symptoms such as fatigue and swelling in the lower extremities that make physical activity difficult. Doctors may prescribe medications like angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or beta blockers to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart as well as diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and swelling in the feet and ankles. The Optimizer Smart system is comprised of several components, including an implantable pulse generator, battery charger, programmer and software. The pulse generator is implanted under the skin in the upper left or right area of the chest and connected to three leads that are implanted in the heart. After the device is implanted, a physician tests and programs the device, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart during regular heartbeats to help improve the heart’s squeezing capability. The FDA evaluated data from two randomized, multi-center clinical trials with a total of 389 patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. All patients received optimal medical therapy and 191 patients also received an Optimizer Smart system implant. Patients receiving the implant showed improvements in the distance they were able to walk in six-minute walking tests and improvements on standard assessments to measure heart failure symptoms, such as how much the symptoms affect a patient’s quality of life and how much the symptoms impede daily physical activities compared to those who received only medical therapy. The Optimizer Smart system is indicated to improve six-minute hall walk distance, quality of life and functional status of certain heart failure patients. These are patients who have a marked limitation of physical activity and who remain symptomatic despite receiving optimal medical therapy. Patients should also have a regular heart rhythm, not be candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy and have a left ventricular ejection fraction (the total amount of blood pumped out in each heart beat) of 25 to 45 percent, which is considered below the normal ejection fraction of 55 to 75 percent. Potential complications associated with the use of the device include infection, bleeding, worsened heart failure or problems with the device itself such as a dislodgement or fracture of the leads implanted in the heart. The FDA granted the Optimizer Smart System a Breakthrough Device designation, meaning the agency provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development, to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the device. To qualify for such designation, a device must provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition. All designated devices must meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients. The FDA granted approval of the Optimizer Smart system to Impulse Dynamics (USA). The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

We’ve dedicated new resources to our enforcement work and I consider these activities the cornerstone of our consumer protection mission and one of our most significant institutional obligations. We’re especially focused on those who would exploit Americans harmed by the opioid crisis with the false promise of products that can treat pain or addiction, but that offer no such benefit,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Today, we posted a warning letter to a company preying on patients who may be seeking alternative treatments for chronic pain, cancers, arthritis and autoimmune and neurological disorders. Health fraud scams like these are inexcusable. These patients deserve proven treatments not false promises that can deter them from seeking otherwise effective care, and that can also contain ingredients or contaminations that can threaten their health. We have great concern for the millions of Americans who live with chronic pain or cancer, and for whom traditional treatment options have been exhausted, as well as those battling opioid addiction. They deserve new advances in care that can address pain without the risk of addiction, not the deception of bogus products that offer no proven benefit. We’ll continue our efforts to protect consumers from such false claims, while also working to advance the development of new treatment options, including non-addictive products for pain management and innovative products for the treatment of opioid use disorder.” The FDA issued a to Nutra Pharma for their products: “Nyloxin Oral Spray,” “Nyloxin Topical Gel,” “Nyloxin Topical Roll-On,” “Nyloxin Topical Roll-On ES,” “Nyloxin Professional Size Pump Topical Gel” and “Regular Strength Sample Pack.” These products also may confuse consumers because its name is similar to FDA-approved drugs. Examples of claims made include: like these can pose serious health risks. These products have not been demonstrated to be safe or effective and may keep some patients from seeking appropriate, FDA-approved therapies. Selling these unapproved products with claims that they can treat chronic pain is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition to supporting the development of alternatives to opioid analgesics for chronic pain, reducing the number of Americans who are addicted to opioids and cutting the rate of new addiction is one of the Administration’s highest priorities. This work includes promoting more widespread innovation and access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for the (OUD). The FDA is taking steps to make safe and effective MAT available to those who suffer from OUD and to reduce the stigma that is sometimes associated with use of these therapies. Using products with unsubstantiated claims may prevent those addicted to opioids from seeking approved treatments that have been demonstrated to be safe and effective, delay their path to recovery and put them at greater risk of death. In fact, patients receiving FDA-approved medication-assisted treatment cut their risk of death from all causes in half, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The FDA has requested responses from Nutra Pharma within 15 working days. The warning letter also states that failure to correct violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. In December 2017 the FDA that prioritizes enforcement and regulatory actions involving drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. Given the concerns about the proliferation of potentially ineffective and harmful products labeled as homeopathic, the FDA previously stated it would consider taking additional enforcement and/or regulatory actions, consistent with its current compliance policies, in the interest of protecting the public.

{"title": "FDA issues warning letters to two breast implant manufacturers for failure to comply with post-approval study requirements", "date": "March 19, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to two breast implant manufacturers for failure to comply with their requirements, under their premarket approval orders, to conduct post-approval studies to assess the long-term safety and risks of their silicone gel-filled breast implants. The FDA issued warning letters to Mentor Worldwide LLC of Irvine, California, and Sientra, Inc. of Santa Barbara, California.  Every manufacturer of approved silicone gel-filled breast implants is required to conduct post-approval studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness of the products and to answer additional scientific questions about the long-term safety and potential risks of breast implants that their premarket clinical trials were not designed to answer. “Post-approval requirements are critical to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the medical products we regulate and we’ll continue to hold manufacturers accountable when they fail to fulfill these obligations,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “We’re issuing these warning letters based on the manufacturers’ low recruitment, poor data, and low follow-up rates in their required post-approval studies. We expect these manufacturers to meet the pre-specified study requirements in order to ensure the collection of long-term data that can be used to inform long-term patient safety.  Post-approval studies, along with other surveillance tools such as adverse event reports, registries, and scientific literature, allow the FDA to help ensure the safety of medical devices and protect patients.” noted several serious deficiencies in the manufacturer’s post-approval study for its MemoryShape breast implant, first approved in 2013, including that the manufacturer had failed to enroll the required number of patients in the study. The action also notes Mentor had poor follow-up rates with patients in the study. Finally, the FDA notified Mentor that there were significant data inconsistencies in the study, including poor patient accounting and missing race and ethnicity data. While the FDA had concluded after reviewing several interim study reports submitted by Mentor that progress on the post-approval study appeared adequate at that time, the agency advised Mentor of concerns about patient enrollment, follow-up rates and data inconsistencies. Mentor’s failure to address these concerns and comply with its post-approval study requirements is a violation of the firm’s pre-market approval order. noted a serious deficiency in the manufacturer’s post-approval study for its Silicone Gel Breast Implants, first approved in 2013. The manufacturer had poor follow-up rates with patients. Currently, the manufacturer reported a follow-up rate of 61 percent, which is below the target follow-up rate. In the response to the manufacturer’s most recent interim study report, the FDA notified the manufacturer that the study progress was inadequate because of low follow-up rates. Sientra’s failure to address these concerns and comply with its post-approval study requirements is a violation of the firm’s pre-market approval order. The FDA requested responses from both manufacturers within 15 working days of the issuance of the warning letters, with details about how the noted violations will be corrected. The FDA may take action for a failure to comply with post-approval orders, including pursuing applicable criminal and civil penalties, where appropriate. The FDA’s actions today are part of the agency’s ongoing commitment to its public health mission of ensuring patient access to safe and effective medical devices. As part of the , the FDA committed to streamlining and modernizing how the agency implements postmarket actions to address device safety issues to make responses to risks more timely and effective, including taking actions against manufacturers when their postmarket studies are non-compliant with any study requirements. The FDA has issued several warning letters in recent years to manufacturers who did not adequately fulfill certain postmarket study requirements, reflecting the agency’s commitment to take more aggressive actions against manufacturers who fail to comply. In addition to the required post-approval studies, the FDA has taken additional steps to ensure the agency is monitoring the safety and risks of breast implants. For instance, FDA staff have coordinated with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the Plastic Surgeons Foundation to develop the Patient Registry and Outcomes for Breast Implants and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) Etiology and Epidemiology ( ), which collects real world data regarding patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of BIA-ALCL. The data collected from this registry, have contributed to a better understanding of BIA-ALCL and FDA to the public regarding BIA-ALCL. Additionally, the FDA has worked with multiple stakeholders to facilitate the development of the National Breast Implant Registry ( to provide a platform for collecting additional real world data on the safety and performance of breast implants. This newly launched registry will greatly add to the information we collect in our own post-approval studies about the long-term safety of breast implants, and potentially enhance our understanding of the long term safety and risks associated with breast implants. The FDA remains committed to thoughtful, scientific, transparent, public dialogue concerning breast implant safety and effectiveness. The FDA welcomes public dialogue about breast implant safety and risk at the of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel at the FDA’s headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland on March 25-26, 2019, which will also be available via webcast. Health care professionals and consumers should report any adverse events related to breast implants to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting program.  The FDA monitors these reports and takes appropriate action necessary to ensure the safety of medical products in the marketplace. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.  The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas on new steps to strengthen FDA’s food safety program for 2020 and beyond", "date": "March 19, 2019", "contents": " When it comes to the foods we eat, we live in an unprecedented time of technological change. Thanks to innovations in technology and the new requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), we now have more opportunities to strengthen public health and bring innovative food products to consumers than perhaps at any other time in our history. But our ability to fulfill these responsibilities becomes more challenging every year with increased globalization, advances in science and technology, and shifts in consumer expectations that drive change throughout the food system. We must continue to embrace innovation across the food safety system to make sure we secure our public health mission. That’s why as part of the President’s 2020 Budget, we’ve proposed new funding across multiple aspects of our food safety system. We must invest to prevent problems from happening by solidifying the agency’s tools under FSMA. We must also embrace new innovations to improve our ability to secure the food supply chain and engage in more effective tracking and tracing of food from farm to fork. This includes continuing to improve our capabilities for both detecting and responding to food contamination when preventive measures alone are insufficient. The funds we’re requesting for food safety represent the FDA’s commitment to the promises we’ve made to help keep people and animals safe from contaminated food, and our vision of a future in which both human and animal health is protected and strengthened by new and emerging technologies that will create a more digital, traceable, diverse, and safer food system. A smarter, more technologically advanced food safety system will always stand on the shoulders of the preventive framework of FSMA. This landmark piece of legislation represented a sea change in food safety. It moved the FDA from a posture of response to one that prevents problems from occurring in the first place. States are critical partners in creating a prevention-based food safety system as part of our integrated national food safety system. To advance these goals, we’re proposing new resources to fund human and animal preventive controls and produce safety inspections through the State Cooperative Agreement Program. The FDA’s funding supports the states in conducting more than half of the domestic food and more than 80 percent of animal feed facility inspections required by FSMA. We also recognize that our most effective toolkit for domestic food safety is not identical to the optimal toolkit for imported food safety. Our budget request reflects those differing needs. Our proposed budget makes other critical investments to help the FDA ensure a more secure and modern food safety framework. The work under FSMA is just one part of our food safety net. We also need to invest in and further modernize our ability to detect and respond to problems in the food supply. For Fiscal Year 2017, our Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition responded to 794 recall events due to issues such as microbial contamination and undeclared allergens and oversaw the recall of 3,609 products, more than any other FDA Center. We know that additional resources are required to ensure that contaminated food is detected and removed from the marketplace as quickly as possible, using the most modern technologies. For example, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has been a game changer for the way we find and address microbial contamination in foods. This technology has made it easier determine the source of contaminated food associated with human illness, and to better identify foodborne outbreaks that previously would have gone undetected. WGS continues to be put into widespread use as the technology itself becomes more accessible, affordable, and much less bulky. We need to expand our use of these modern tools. At the same time, the more widespread use of WGS has also increased the number of detected outbreaks and subsequent investigations. This is good news. We are identifying more sources of potential food contamination and taking steps to reduce risks to consumers. But at the same time, the success of WGS in identifying sources of food contamination and outbreaks has also greatly increased the FDA’s workload to identify and mitigate potential food safety concerns. In Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018, the evaluated nearly 120 potential human food safety outbreak incidents per year. This is nearly double what was reviewed in Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016. The increase requested in the 2020 Budget will allow the agency to add new staff and resources to enhance signal detection, response to outbreaks and post-response evaluations. As part of the President’s 2020 Budget, we’re also requesting additional resources to support the use of WGS and expand our ability to respond when we identify food contamination. These additional resources also will increase the FDA’s ability to leverage other new technologies that make it easier to track and trace products throughout the product lifecycle, from the time that they’re grown or manufactured, until a consumer uses them. Efficiently tracking and tracing regulated products will enable the FDA to work with stakeholders, including industry producers, to more quickly remove harmful products or ingredients from the supply chain. Over the last year alone, we faced challenges dealing with the complexities of supply chain tracking and management related to two outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in romaine lettuce where records were being kept mostly on paper. In the wake of these two incidents, we worked with industry on common sense changes, like providing greater clarity on package labeling by including harvest date and location, and calling for industry to better improve traceability. In recent years, we’ve seen emerging track and trace technologies that can assist response efforts to allow the FDA to intervene in time to alert consumers, implement recalls, and avoid human illnesses. This includes blockchain technology. This technology uses a decentralized, secure, ledger that’s shared by all parties in the supply chain to provide transparency on a product’s origins. It can greatly assist in warning consumers about risks with specific foods and in implementing more targeted and efficient recalls. Such technologies can reduce the time it takes to find a food source from days or weeks, to minutes or even seconds, in certain cases. While our primary goal in enhancing track and trace is protecting public health, this new technology will also assist industry by minimizing the number of products implicated in outbreaks of foodborne illness and other product problems that could result in the loss of millions of dollars in profits. When the lack of transparency in supply chains delays the identification of contamination sources and the root causes of product problems, the economic and public health costs can be considerable. An enhanced ability to trace foods to source during an outbreak will also allow us to conduct better and more real-time root cause analysis to prevent similar reoccurrences. Finally, our enhanced use of state food safety resources can also help our work securing the safety of imported foods, allowing the FDA to focus more resources on import oversight. Planned resources in the 2020 Budget request will also advance our import program goal of ensuring that domestic and imported foods receive parity of oversight by investing in additional resources to increase compliance with (FSVP) as well as assessing the agency’s Just as consumer demands have changed how we respond to problems with food, the FDA supports industry as it develops and implements new technologies in food and veterinary products. This includes biotechnology products. Although neither traditional human nor animal food products require pre-market approval, new foods and new ingredients such as food and color additives must be reviewed to determine that they will be safe for the ways in which they’ll be used. We want to improve the timeliness of these reviews and eliminate unnecessary burdens to industry related to the premarket safety reviews of these food ingredients. We’ve requested additional resources to help us meet these important objectives. Biotechnologies are enabling the development of many promising, innovative food products, such as genome-edited animals and plants. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the development of new protein sources, such as cell-culture technology. Part of our public health mission is to advance these promising innovations and to ensure they’re safe, and that they don’t have any unintended consequences. Last fall, the FDA announced a new . Our plan is focused on advancing policy priorities the FDA will pursue to clarify our science-and-risk-based approach for product developers; avoiding unnecessary barriers to future innovation in plant and animal biotechnology; and securing their safety and our public health mission. In the 2020 Budget, we’ve requested additional resources to ensure that the FDA continues to keep pace with the increasing requests for review of new products. We’re dedicated to making sure the FDA continues building a modern, prevention-based food safety system. We believe that the additional resources requested from Congress will help our program better protect our nation’s food supply and lay the foundation for efforts to create a new era of smarter food safety in which new technologies can provide innovative products, help us better detect outbreaks, and better track and trace foods in the supply chain to prevent contaminated foods from reaching consumers.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new efforts to advance treatment strategies for helping youth addicted to nicotine as a result of the epidemic rise in teen use of e-cigarettes", "date": "April 01, 2019", "contents": " As we continue to address the troubling epidemic of youth e-cigarette use, we’ve committed to employing a number of tools as part of our to ensure no tobacco products are being marketed to, sold to, or used by kids. We’ve taken a series of escalating . We’ve launched to warn youth about the dangers of e-cigarette and other tobacco product use. And most recently, we aimed at preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and cigars. But given the rise in youth e-cigarette use, we are faced with a challenging and troubling reality: We must not only seek to prevent youth from using tobacco in any form; we must also explore evidence-based approaches to address existing youth tobacco use and youth addiction to nicotine. The need is clear. We’ve heard too many painful stories from parents of teenagers, pediatricians, and young people themselves; and, they reinforce what we all already know – for many young e-cigarette users, addiction has already taken hold. These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit. Today, I want to update you on our latest efforts to help treat teen addiction to nicotine and announce a new intended to help further examine the science and treatment strategies to support youth tobacco cessation. In many therapeutic areas, including tobacco addiction and cessation, we know unique challenges exist when it comes to treating pediatric populations. Although there’s a large body of research on adult smoking cessation, the methods to treat adolescents who’re addicted to vaping are not well understood. There’s little information about how drug or behavioral interventions might support youth e-cigarette and tobacco cessation. That’s why, as part of ongoing efforts to examine the science and treatment strategies related to youth tobacco cessation, we held a in January on this topic that was invaluable in providing a range of perspectives on this important issue and announced new to support research on youth tobacco initiation, use and cessation that we are hopeful will help inform our regulatory policies. Our efforts on this front have been helpful, but it’s imperative that we continue the dialogue, especially with respect to e-cigarettes, which remain the most commonly used tobacco product among our nation’s youth. The most recent data show more than 3.6 million middle and high school students across the country were current (within the past 30 days) e-cigarette users in 2018. This is a dramatic increase of 1.5 million students from the previous year. The data also showed that youth who used e-cigarettes also were using them more frequently, and they were using flavored e-cigarette products more often, than in 2017. This is particularly troubling given research shows kids using e-cigarettes are more likely to take up combustible cigarettes. There’s a large pool of nicotine users being created among school-age children who are using e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. And some portion of them are at risk of taking up cigarettes and becoming addicted to them. Youth e-cigarette and other tobacco product use also raises other health concerns, not only risk of addiction to nicotine early on in life, but potential harm to the developing adolescent brain, and exposure to chemicals known to have adverse health effects. The rapid growth in the popularity of e-cigarettes among youth to epidemic levels necessitates we explore all options for how to address this public health concern. And our continued efforts to discuss ways to use drug therapies to treat teen addiction to nicotine underscores the deeply troubling nature of the public health problem that we’re confronting. To that end, the that will be held May 15 will further discuss scientific understanding and treatment options for youth tobacco addiction and cessation, with a focus on e-cigarette cessation. The workshop will build on many of the scientific issues raised during the January public hearing. As part of our efforts to address this issue, we determined that holding both a public hearing and a scientific workshop would provide forums for gathering public input first, followed by robust scientific discussion with stakeholders. The workshop is being hosted in collaboration with the FDA by the Institute for Advanced Clinical Trials for Children and the Duke Clinical Research Institute, which have previously received grants to establish a Global Pediatric Clinical Trials Network to facilitate clinical trials of new drugs and devices for children in a range of therapeutic areas. This workshop is intended to gather scientific information and stimulate discussion about the current science regarding youth tobacco use and addiction, and treatment strategies to support youth tobacco cessation. The workshop will include presentations and panel discussions relating to the unique factors impacting youth tobacco use and addiction and the challenges associated with youth tobacco cessation. For example, discussion is expected to include the basic science of tobacco addiction in adolescents, the current state of behavioral and pharmacotherapy cessation strategies in adolescents, and the development of strategies to generate robust evidence to address youth tobacco cessation. When it comes to the treatment of nicotine addiction in youth, we want to explore how we can support the development of such therapies. We are hopeful this scientific workshop will help provide valuable information and input that the FDA can use to further address e-cigarette use among youth and help those who may already be addicted to these products through potential new therapies. We cannot risk a whole generation of kids getting addicted to nicotine. Prevention is a critical cornerstone of our efforts to reverse the alarming trend of rising youth use of novel products like e-cigarettes, but we must also put strategies in place now to help those who are already addicted quit.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., and Director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., on efforts to promote and foster blood pathogen reduction technologies", "date": "March 26, 2019", "contents": " Blood products are critical to public health. They offer potentially life-saving benefits for a variety of acute and chronic conditions ranging from the treatment of trauma victims to the supportive care of individuals receiving chemotherapy for cancer. They also facilitate important modern surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting, hip replacement, and liver transplantation. Ensuring the safety of blood products is one of our highest priorities. This owes not only to the important role that they play in medical care, but also to their unique risks. Blood products can be susceptible to contamination by both existing and emerging pathogens. In cases where the pathogens aren’t readily identified, there’s a risk that many people receiving blood products could be exposed to an emerging pathogen even before the danger is identified. For these and other reasons, there’s a need for better safety measures to mitigate the potential risks to blood products. The good news is that the technology exists to potentially transform our assurance of safety of these blood products, while potentially reducing their cost. Some of the potential dangers come from year-round infectious risks such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and seasonal or local risks, which include West Nile virus and Babesia. Although donor screening and testing can mitigate the risk of transfusion transmission of infectious diseases, they don’t eliminate the risk entirely. Donor screening and testing of collected blood also adds to the complexity and cost of maintaining a safe blood supply. Pathogen reduction technologies can address the infectious risk from viral and bacterial pathogens, enabling us to improve our assurance of safety and reduce the cost of testing. Current pathogen reduction technologies use nucleic acid binding compounds and/or ultraviolet light, either alone, or in combination. They work by binding to and eliminating pathogens directly, or by inactivating them to render them harmless. Some of the current pathogen reduction technologies can also potentially reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease without the need for a radiation source. Avoiding the need for radiation sources reduces cost and avoids a potential security risk. Current pathogen reduction technologies have certain limitations. For example, they don’t inactivate some viruses like parvovirus, and they don’t address prions, which are protein based infectious agents. But they address more than 95 percent of the existing and emerging pathogens that are of concern for the blood supply. Another downside is that the currently available pathogen reduction technologies are somewhat cumbersome to implement in practice. They must be applied to each of the different blood components after they are separated, rather than prior to separation. This adds to the cost of implementation. But we believe these technologies could offer a big advantage to the current approaches for screening blood, and we believe with continued investments these new approaches will improve. The ideal pathogen reduction technology would be relatively inexpensive, simple to implement on Whole Blood, and would allow the blood to subsequently be easily separated into the different components such as packed red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. In addition, it would provide sufficiently robust pathogen inactivation. This could potentially enable many of the existing donor screening requirements – such as those for travel to malaria-endemic areas – to be reduced or removed. Moreover, several current tests, such as those for West Nile virus and Babesia, could potentially be eliminated. This could reduce the cost of screening blood, improve safety, and increase the donor pool. Whether an existing technology can be advanced to fully meet the above ideal is not certain, but preliminary work shows that achieving something close to the ideal is potentially possible. Such a technology would represent a major public health advance over our current screening tools. Given the importance of blood safety and availability to public health, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with a variety of different partners to pursue multiple avenues of research to advance pathogen reduction technology. We believe perfecting these approaches is a critical priority. This technology isn’t a panacea for blood safety. But by addressing both a variety of known pathogens and offering protection against many emerging pathogens, the application of a simple, safe and effective pathogen reduction technology potentially could measurably increase the safety of the blood supply while reducing cost. It’s only a matter of time before the emergence of the next infectious pathogen of concern. We believe we have at hand the technology that could help dramatically reduce these threats.

Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. MS is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than in men. For most people, MS starts with a relapsing-remitting course, in which episodes of worsening function (relapses) are followed by recovery periods (remissions). These remissions may not be complete and may leave patients with some degree of residual disability. Many, but not all, patients with MS experience some degree of persistent disability that gradually worsens over time. In some patients, disability may progress independent of relapses, a process termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).  In the first few years of this process, many patients continue to experience relapses, a phase of the disease described as active SPMS. Active SPMS is one of the relapsing forms of MS, and drugs approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS can be used to treat active SPMS. Later, many patients with SPMS stop experiencing new relapses, but disability continues to progress, a phase called non-active SPMS. The efficacy of Mayzent was shown in a clinical trial of 1,651 patients that compared Mayzent to placebo in patients with SPMS who had evidence of disability progression in the prior two years and no relapses in the three months prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to three-month confirmed progression in disability. The fraction of patients with confirmed progression of disability was statistically significantly lower in the Mayzent group than in the placebo group. Mayzent also decreased the number of relapses experienced by these patients. In the subgroup of patients with non-active SPMS, the results were not statistically significant. Mayzent must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Mayzent may increase the risk of infections, so patients should have a complete blood count taken before treatment is initiated. The drug may cause macular edema, so patients should contact their physician if they experience a change in vision. Mayzent may cause transient decreases in heart rate and may cause a decline in lung function. Liver enzymes should be checked before initiation of the drug and health care professionals should closely monitor patients with severe liver impairment. Health care professionals should monitor the patient’s blood pressure during treatment. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 10 days after stopping the drug due to the potential risk of fetal harm. Health care professionals should monitor patients for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and monitor patients that had treatment with immunosuppressive/immune-modulating therapies because there may be unintended additive immunosuppression with Mayzent. The most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Mayzent in the clinical trials include headache, high blood pressure and liver function test increases. The FDA granted approval of Mayzent to Novartis.

{"title": "FDA warns homeopathic firms for putting patients at risk with significant violations of manufacturing quality standards", "date": "April 01, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today posted warning letters to four companies who produce homeopathic drug products for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations, including a letter to King Bio Inc. of Asheville, N.C. The FDA previously the public about the agency’s serious concerns with the quality of drug products produced by King Bio. “In late 2017, the FDA proposed a comprehensive, risk-based enforcement approach to drug products labeled as homeopathic and marketed without the required FDA approval. While the agency continues to examine this approach, the homeopathic industry has continued to grow, and we need to continue to address, consistent with our current enforcement policies, situations where products labeled as homeopathic are being marketed for serious diseases and/or conditions where the products haven’t been shown to offer clinical benefits. We’re committed to continue taking appropriate actions when we believe patients are being put at risk by products that contain potentially harmful ingredients or have significant quality issues. One company that continues to concern us because of the low quality of their operation and the threat their products pose to consumers is King Bio. Despite previous actions we’ve taken, our concerns remain. The warning letter we’re sending is a formal notice to King Bio outlining a number of ongoing, serious violations with their manufacturing operations that must be corrected,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Today we’ve also posted warnings letters to three other homeopathic drug manufacturers for additional concerns we’ve observed – from the use of toxic substances like snake venom that has the potential to cause harm and does not have demonstrated benefit, to other firms whose products we’ve found to be contaminated. These actions build on similar steps we’ve taken over the past year, as we continue to see products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed without approval for a wide array of diseases and conditions, from chronic pain to cancer. In addition to our concerns with contamination, some products labeled as homeopathic may not deliver any benefit and may have the potential to cause harm. That’s why we’ve proposed a new regulatory approach to prioritize additional enforcement and regulatory actions against certain products labeled as homeopathic. We’re focused on products that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients, including products for vulnerable populations like children. The actions we’ve taken recently, and over the course of the past year are further warning to all companies that these types of products must be manufactured and labeled appropriately. We’re working to finalize our draft guidance in the coming months to help ensure that products that reach consumers are not harmful to their health.” Products labeled as homeopathic have not been approved by the FDA for any use and may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Products labeled as can be made from a wide range of substances, including ingredients derived from plants, healthy or diseased animal or human sources, minerals and chemicals. These products are often marketed as natural, safe and effective alternatives to approved prescription and nonprescription products and are widely available in the marketplace. These unapproved drugs may cause significant and even irreparable harm if they are poorly manufactured, which can lead to contamination, or may contain active ingredients that aren’t adequately tested or disclosed to patients, such as belladonna, which the agency has previously to King Bio Inc. provides details of flaws in manufacturing operations and quality assurance systems found during a July 2018 FDA inspection of the facility. Beyond the violations found during the inspection, the FDA collected and tested samples of finished homeopathic drug products; results revealed inordinately high microbiological contamination. Additionally, evidence collected during the FDA’s inspection indicated recurring microbial contamination associated with the water system used to manufacture drugs. The microbiological contamination of the water system led, in part, to a of more than 900 potentially homeopathic drug products manufactured by King Bio. Following the July 2018 inspection, the and pet owners not to use drug products, including homeopathic drug products, made by King Bio and labeled as Dr. King’s, as these products may pose a safety risk to people (especially infants, children, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems), as well as pets due to the high levels of microbial contamination identified at the manufacturing site. The company recalled all drug products made with water marketed for humans and animals. King Bio manufactures a range of products including those for children, adults and pets. Since August 2018, more than 900 potentially contaminated products manufactured by King Bio have been recalled, including those labeled as Aquaflora, Canada, Dr. King’s Natural Medicine(s), Natural Pet, People’s Best and SafeCare. Additionally, other products manufactured by King Bio and distributed by other companies under different brand names were also recalled due to contamination. These include products sold under the brand names Today, the FDA also posted warning letters to additional companies for products labeled as homeopathic due to various quality and misbranding violations. The FDA has taken similar actions this year, including a warning letter to Nutra Pharma Corp., Boca Raton, Fla.; as announced earlier this month, the FDA issued a regarding the company illegally marketing unapproved products labeled as homeopathic with claims about their ability to treat addiction and chronic pain; the agency also to this health fraud scam. In February, the FDA issued a to Pure Source LLC, Doral, Fla. for distributing drugs made with contaminated raw materials. In December 2017, the FDA that prioritizes enforcement and regulatory actions involving drug products labeled as homeopathic and marketed without the required FDA approval that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. Given the concerns about the proliferation of potentially ineffective and harmful products labeled as homeopathic, the FDA stated when it issued the draft guidance that it would consider taking additional enforcement and/or regulatory actions, consistent with its current compliance policies, in the interest of protecting the public.

Insulin is a critical hormone that regulates sugar metabolism. The body’s inability to produce sufficient levels of natural insulin can lead to diabetes – both inherited Type 1 and Type 2, typically called adult onset. Diabetes affects nearly 30 million Americans and can lead to serious and life-threatening complications, including heart disease, organ failure and blindness. Diabetes takes a tremendous toll on Americans, both physically and economically. It remains the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. and accounts for $330 billion in annual health care spending. While some patients with Type 2 diabetes can control their diabetes through diet, exercise and oral medications, more than seven million diabetics require daily insulin injections to maintain glycemic control and reduce the risk of health complications. But access to this critical drug can be increasingly difficult for these Americans. Insulin list prices regularly increase by double digits annually. These increases have raised serious concerns about the ability for many patients to access the insulin needed to survive. As a society, we must ensure that everyone who needs insulin has access. Driving down drug prices requires a comprehensive approach. But one impactful route is through competition. This is particularly true following the introductions of generics, especially when there are three or more generic competitors – which has been shown to bring down prices more sharply than with only one or two generic competitors. A robust pathway for generic competition is critical to expanding drug access and promoting public health. The FDA has worked hard to encourage generic entry after patents and other exclusivities have lapsed. Ours is one of the most competitive generic markets in the world. But there is more to do and we’re committed to further expanding access to these high-quality, affordable products. Not all parts of the pharmaceutical market have been equally open to competition from more affordable products. This is especially true for biologic medicines, which are typically complex molecules produced by living cells, and are increasingly the backbone of modern therapy. Until recently, biologics lacked effective competition because there was no abbreviated pathway for bringing follow-on versions of biologics to market under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), similar to the generic pathway we have for small molecule drugs under created under the 1984 Hatch Waxman amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). In 2010, Congress, through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act), gave the FDA the authority to implement a pathway for approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products, to open biologics to competition, ultimately providing more treatment options, increasing access to lifesaving medications and potentially lowering health care costs. We’ve set out in recent months to advance new policies to promote more competition when it comes to biosimilar products and to advance our overall framework that improves the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process. This includes new steps to implement Congress’s direction that we transition certain biological products currently approved as drugs under the FD&C Act to be licensed as biologics under the PHS Act, making them subject to biosimilar competition. Transitioning biological products currently regulated as drugs to being regulated as biologics will enable – for the first time – products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, these products to come to market. The FDA can play an important role in encouraging competition by implementing a robust pathway for biosimilar competition. We’re taking new steps to advance this framework. This transition is particularly important for insulin. Although they are biologics, insulin products have historically been regulated under the FD&C Act rather than the PHS Act, which governs the FDA approval of most biologics. Biologics are typically isolated from a variety of natural sources – human, animal or microorganism – and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting-edge technologies. Due in part to the complexities of these products, it has been hard to bring a substitutable generic insulin to the market under the FD&C Act. The transition of insulin from the drug to the biologics pathway will open up these products to biosimilar competition. We’re already seeing robust activity among sponsors seeking to bring forward biosimilar copies of insulin. The framework for demonstrating that these insulin products are interchangeable should also be efficient and achievable. Bringing forward generic copies of insulin under the old drug pathway was challenging. Generally, it was difficult to prove sameness for a biological product under the Hatch-Waxman pathway for traditional generic drugs. We believe the biosimilar pathway will enable a more robust route for developing lower cost copies of insulin, including products that are fully interchangeable with branded insulins. Once an interchangeable insulin product is approved and available on the market, it can then be substituted for the reference product at the pharmacy, potentially leading to increased access and lower costs for patients. The FDA anticipates that biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products will bring the competition that’s needed to help bring affordable treatment options to patients. As we transition biologics to this pathway, we recognize there are unique challenges associated with bringing biosimilar and interchangeable insulin to market. We’re working now – in advance of the 2020 transition – to build a solid regulatory foundation for the review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. That’s why today we’re announcing a to discuss access to affordable insulin products, as well as the scientific and regulatory issues related to the development and evaluation of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. At the public hearing, we want to hear from stakeholders about what factors the agency should consider when evaluating data and other information submitted by an applicant, including from analytical and clinical studies, to determine whether an insulin product is biosimilar or interchangeable to a reference product. We also want stakeholder feedback on whether certain insulin products, for example, those that use insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous infusion among the approved uses or those approved with over-the-counter marketing status, raise unique scientific considerations that we should be considering when evaluating biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products. Importantly, we’ll also be seeking input directly from patients about their experience with insulin products and this input will inform the FDA’s approach to implementing the regulatory pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. We understand the urgent need to address the high prices and lack of competition in the insulin market. Ultimately the input we receive at the public hearing will help to inform steps the FDA can take to advance access to insulin products, including biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. We’re also interested in how the agency can encourage the development of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products while achieving the balance between competition and innovation intended by Congress in the BPCI Act. The work of the agency leading up to the 2020 transition is vitally important. In , we took a suite of actions designed to advance the agency’s biosimilar framework. We also recently updated our policy on the , clarifying that all new biologics, biosimilars and interchangeable products will receive a suffix to their core name to aid in effective pharmacovigilance. The new policy also clarified that transition biological products, such as insulin products approved under the FD&C Act, will not have their names changed. Newly approved biological products, including biosimilar products, will continue to receive a suffix in their proper name. Generally, the only biologics without a suffix will be older products that were approved before the suffix policy was implemented. The FDA’s work to advance the pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products is also complemented by other steps the agency is taking as part of its (BAP). We are committed to ongoing enhancements to the review of biosimilar applications and to providing greater regulatory and scientific clarity for biosimilar applicants and other stakeholders. The FDA will be announcing additional progress in the coming months, including the issuance of guidance on interchangeablity, as outlined in the BAP. We’ll also continue to address potential barriers to biosimilar competition as they emerge, including new steps in partnership with colleagues at the Federal Trade Commission. While the regulatory transition of insulin products nears, we’re cognizant of the fact that it won’t be soon enough for the millions of Americans who struggle to pay for their insulin today. Helping to ensure patients have access to the critical drugs is a responsibility shared by all stakeholders, including manufacturers and health plans. We all need to do our part. A drug that’s nearly a century old should not have a list price that increases between 15-17% annually. American patients who rely on insulin to live deserve to have high-quality, affordable options. The FDA is dedicated to facilitating access to insulin. We hope our industry partners will join us in doing all we can to help people who need access to the live saving medicines, now.

{"title": "FDA takes new enforcement actions as part of the agency’s ongoing effort to combat the illegal online sales of opioids", "date": "April 02, 2019", "contents": " Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the issuance of two warning letters to operators of websites that illegally market potentially dangerous, unapproved and misbranded opioid medications, including tramadol. The warning letters issued to request that they immediately cease offering violative drugs for sale to U.S. consumers. The rise in illegal sales of opioids over the internet is a critical public health concern and major focus of attention by the FDA. These drugs are highly addictive and can be deadly when used without a doctor’s supervision. To further advance innovative solutions to protecting Americans from opioids that are illegally being sold online, today the agency is also hosting internet stakeholders, thought leaders, government entities, academic researchers and advocacy groups at its second . The summit will focus on opportunities to reduce the availability of opioids online by working with website registries and registrars, which play an important role in the registration of internet domain names. “To combat the opioid epidemic, we need to work across all of our authorities to reduce exposure to opioid drugs in the medical setting, advance innovations that can offer non-addictive alternatives for the treatment of pain, promote the development and awareness of therapies that can help those currently addicted to opioids, and target the illegal sale of illicit drugs online and through the mail. The illicit sale of opioids online is a particularly critical concern as the nature of the epidemic shifts from one where new addiction was primarily formed in the medical setting, to a crisis where more and more of the new exposure is through illicit drugs. These drugs are often purchased online and received through the mail,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Given the grave consequences of these illegal online sales, we’ve been aggressively targeting websites illegally offering opioids for sale. Today we added two more actions that now brings our total to 25 warning letters identifying more than 450 websites since September 2017. While we’ll continue to identify and take action against violative websites, we know that enforcement action alone is unlikely to stop new websites from starting up. Stopping these websites from illegally offering opioids for sale will require a broad collaboration across the internet community. We’re continuing our work with other stakeholders to identify opportunities to reduce the illegal online sale of opioids, including internet companies who’ve taken concrete steps to combat the illegal sale of opioids through their platforms and services. These partnerships can have a significant impact in the fight against opioid addiction. Already, we’ve seen a positive impact from this work. Google has begun to deindex websites named in our warning letters that cite the unlawful sale of opioids; social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have started to redirect users looking to buy opioids to a government help line. We applaud these actions and similar steps being taken, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue in today’s meeting. There are still too many consumers who have access to illegal opioid products online, and we’ll continue to take steps to target and end these illegal sales.” Opioid addiction is an immense public health crisis. According to the , in 2017, opioids killed 47,600 people in the U.S., a 13 percent increase over the number killed in 2016. Addressing this crisis is one of the FDA’s highest priorities. Our efforts support the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Rogue online pharmacies, drug dealers and others continue to use the internet to illegally promote and sell opioids, where the risk of detection and repercussions is significantly reduced. The FDA is committed to targeting these illegal sales and working with internet stakeholders to advance a proactive approach to cracking down on internet traffic in illicit drugs to address this public health emergency. The sale of unapproved and misbranded opioids poses heightened dangers to consumers who purchase those products. Patients who buy prescription drugs, including opioids, from illegal online pharmacies may put their health at risk because the products, while being marketed as authentic, may be counterfeit, contaminated, expired or otherwise unsafe. As noted in the warning letters, these websites offer to sell opioids that are misbranded and unapproved new drugs, including unapproved tramadol, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition to health risks, illegal online pharmacies can pose other risks to consumers, including credit card fraud, identity theft and computer viruses. While the agency is concerned about online sales of all the opioid products, the warning letters issued to azmedicinalshop.com and thedonrx.net specifically cite the illegal sale of tramadol. As with all opioids, FDA-approved tramadol has a boxed warning, the FDA’s most prominent warning, indicating that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or even life-threatening adverse effects. The boxed warning also addresses risks including addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression (breathing problems) and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies). In addition, when taken with other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, tramadol’s use may result in coma or death. The FDA requested responses from each of the warning letter recipients within 15 working days. They are directed to inform the agency of the specific actions taken to address the violations outlined in the warning letter. Those entities that fail to correct the violations may be subject to further regulatory action. The FDA remains committed to addressing the national crisis of opioid addiction on all fronts, with a significant focus on decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies and opioids more resistant to abuse and misuse; and taking action against those involved in the illegal importation and sale of opioids. The agency will also continue to evaluate how opioids currently on the market are used, in both medical and illicit settings, and take regulatory action where needed. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps to advance agency’s continued evaluation of potential regulatory pathways for cannabis-containing and cannabis-derived products ", "date": "April 02, 2019", "contents": " In recent years, we’ve seen a growing interest in the development of therapies and other FDA-regulated consumer products derived from cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) and its components, including cannabidiol (CBD). This interest spans the range of product categories that the agency regulates. For example, we’ve seen, or heard of interest in, products containing cannabis or cannabis derivatives that are marketed as human drugs, dietary supplements, conventional foods, animal foods and drugs, and cosmetics, among other things. We also recognize that stakeholders are looking to the FDA for clarity on how our authorities apply to such products, what pathways are available to market such products lawfully under these authorities, and how the FDA is carrying out its responsibility to protect public health and safety with respect to such products. Interest in these products increased last December when Congress passed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill). Among other things, this law established a new category of cannabis classified as “hemp” – defined as cannabis and cannabis derivatives with extremely low (no more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it is no longer a controlled substance under federal law. At the same time, Congress explicitly preserved the FDA’s current authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In doing so, Congress recognized the agency’s important public health role with respect to all the products it regulates. This allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways, to the extent permitted by law, for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. When the 2018 Farm Bill became law, I issued a explaining the FDA’s current approach to these products and our intended next steps. Consistent with the approach and commitments described in that statement, today the FDA is announcing a number of important new steps and actions to advance our consideration of a framework for the lawful marketing of appropriate cannabis and cannabis-derived products under our existing authorities. These new steps include: The public hearing will give stakeholders an opportunity to provide the FDA with additional input relevant to the agency’s regulatory strategy related to existing products, as well as the lawful pathways by which appropriate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds can be marketed, and how we can make these legal pathways more predictable and efficient. We hope to gain additional information and data for the FDA to consider with respect to products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD. As we’ve stated before, we treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as we do any other FDA-regulated products. Among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that’s marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. Additionally, it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD, or the psychoactive compound THC, into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as dietary supplements. This is because CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drug products and were the subject of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as food. In such situations, with certain exceptions that are not applicable here, the only path that the FD&C Act allows for such substances to be added to foods or marketed as dietary supplements is if the FDA first issues a regulation, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, allowing such use. While the availability of CBD products in particular has increased dramatically in recent years, open questions remain regarding the safety considerations raised by their widespread use. For example, during its review of the marketing application for – a purified form of CBD that the FDA approved in 2018 for use in the treatment of certain seizure disorders – the FDA identified certain safety risks, including the potential for liver injury. These are serious risks that can be managed when the product is taken under medical supervision in accordance with the FDA-approved labeling for the product, but it is less clear how this risk might be managed in a setting where this drug substance is used far more widely, without medical supervision and not in accordance with FDA-approved labeling. There are also unresolved questions regarding the cumulative exposure to CBD if people access it across a broad range of consumer products, as well as questions regarding the intended functionality of CBD in such products. Additionally, there are open questions about whether some threshold level of CBD could be allowed in foods without undermining the drug approval process or diminishing commercial incentives for further clinical study of the relevant drug substance. It’s critical that we address these unanswered questions about CBD and other cannabis and cannabis-derived products to help inform the FDA’s regulatory oversight of these products – especially as the agency considers whether it could be appropriate to exercise its authority to allow the use of CBD in dietary supplements and other foods. As I stated in December, the FDA would only consider this path if the agency were able to determine that all other requirements in the FD&C Act are met, including those required for food additives or new dietary ingredients. As part of the public hearing and related public comment period, the agency is interested in whether there are particular safety concerns that we should be aware of as we consider the FDA’s regulatory oversight and monitoring of these products. For example, we’re seeking comments, data and information on a variety of topics including: what levels of cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds cause safety concerns; how the mode of delivery (e.g., ingestion, absorption, inhalation) affects the safety of, and exposure to, these compounds; how cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds interact with other substances such as drug ingredients; and other questions outlined in the hearing announcement. Additionally, we’re interested in how the incentives for, and the feasibility of, drug development with CBD and other cannabis-derived compounds would be affected if the commercial availability of products with these compounds, such as foods and dietary supplements, were to become significantly more widespread. We don’t want companies to forgo research that might support approval through the FDA’s drug review process, which could potentially lead to important safe and effective therapies. We also don’t want patients to forgo appropriate medical treatment by substituting unapproved products for approved medicines used to prevent, treat, mitigate or cure a particular disease or condition. For example, in the case of Epidiolex, the adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that supported its approval, and the assurance of manufacturing quality standards, can provide prescribers confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes. It’s important that we continue to assess whether there could be medical ramifications if patients choose to take CBD to treat certain diseases at levels higher or lower than studied in well-controlled clinical studies. We hope that information we receive through the public hearing this May, as well as through the written public comment process, will help inform our consideration of these and other important scientific, technical and policy questions. Given the importance of these questions, and the significant public interest with respect to CBD in particular, we’re forming a high-level internal agency working group to explore potential pathways for dietary supplements and/or conventional foods containing CBD to be lawfully marketed. Given the importance of this issue, I’ve asked Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. and Principal Associate Commissioner for Policy Lowell Schiller, to co-chair the group and charged them with considering what options might be appropriate under our current authorities, in view of all the evidence before us and our agency’s fundamental public health mission. I’m also asking the group to consider whether there are legislative options that might lead to more efficient and appropriate pathways than might be available under current law – again, with the same science-based, public health focus that the FDA endeavors to bring to all matters before it. This is a complicated topic and we expect that it could take some time to resolve fully. Nevertheless, we're deeply focused on this issue and committed to continuing to engage relevant stakeholders as we consider potential paths forward. The working group plans to begin sharing information and/or findings with the public as early as Summer 2019. We’ll continue to use our authorities to take action against companies illegally selling these types of products when they are putting consumers at risk. I am deeply concerned about any circumstance where product developers make unproven claims to treat serious or life-threatening diseases, and where patients may be misled to forgo otherwise effective, available therapy and opt instead for a product that has no proven value or may cause them serious harm. Today, the FDA is announcing that it has issued warning letters, in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission, to three companies – – in response to their making unsubstantiated claims related to more than a dozen different products and spanning multiple product webpages, online stores and social media websites. The companies used these online platforms to make unfounded, egregious claims about their products' ability to limit, treat or cure cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, autoimmune diseases, opioid use disorder, and other serious diseases, without sufficient evidence and the legally required FDA approval. Examples of claims made by these companies include: I believe these are egregious, over-the-line claims and we won’t tolerate this kind of deceptive marketing to vulnerable patients. The FDA continues to be concerned about the proliferation of egregious medical claims being made about products asserting to contain CBD that haven’t been approved by the FDA, such as the products and companies receiving warning letters today. CBD is marketed in a variety of product types, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas and topical lotions and creams. Often such products are sold online and are therefore available throughout the country. Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims can put patients and consumers at risk. These products have not been shown to be safe or effective, and deceptive marketing of unproven treatments may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases. Additionally, because they are not evaluated by the FDA, there may be other ingredients that are not disclosed, which may be harmful. As our actions today make clear, the FDA stands ready to protect consumers from companies illegally selling CBD products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes. The agency has and will continue to monitor the marketplace and take enforcement action as needed to protect the public health against companies illegally selling cannabis and cannabis-derived products that can put consumers at risk and are being marketed and distributed in violation of the FDA’s authorities. Ultimately, we remain committed to exploring an appropriate, efficient and predictable regulatory framework to allow product developers that meet the requirements under our authorities to lawfully market these types of products. The actions we’re announcing today will allow us to continue to clarify our regulatory authority over these products and seek input from a broad range of stakeholders and examine a variety of approaches and considerations in the marketing and regulation of cannabis or cannabis-derived products, while continuing to protect the public’s health and safety. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. on May 31, as well as a broader opportunity for written public comment, for stakeholders to share their experiences and challenges with these products, including information and views related to product safety.

CBD has demonstrated the ability to block spinal, peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms responsible for the pain associated with migraines, fibromyalgia, IBS and other related disorders.” “Cannabidiol May be Effective for Treating Substance Use Disorders.” “CBD reduced the rewarding effects of morphine and reduced drug seeking of heroin.” “CBD may be used to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms.”"},
{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on steps the Agency is taking to prevent potential medical device shortages and ensure safe and effective sterilization amid shutdown of a large contract sterilization facility", "date": "March 26, 2019", "contents": " A critical focus for the FDA is preventing and mitigating potential medical product shortages. As part of these efforts, we’re taking steps to address potential medical device shortages due to the recent closure of a large sterilization facility in Illinois. We’re working to ensure that safe and effective sterilization of medical devices continues and hospitals, health care providers and patients have access to critical devices. Earlier this year, the FDA became aware that the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop a contract sterilizer, Sterigenics, from sterilizing medical products and other products with gas called ethylene oxide at their Willowbrook, Illinois facility. The state EPA order was due to the presence of levels of ethylene oxide higher than the EPA found to be acceptable in air around the facility. As the agency responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of all medical devices, the FDA has been closely monitoring the situation and working with device manufacturers affected by the closure to minimize any impact to patients who need access to these medical devices. Certain medical devices need to be sterilized to reduce the risk of those devices causing infections in patients from living microorganisms. Sterilization of medical devices is a well-established and scientifically-proven method of preventing harmful microorganisms from reproducing and transmitting infections. It’s critical to our health care system.  And ethylene oxide is a commonly used method of medical device sterilization. It’s considered a safe and effective method that helps ensure the safety of medical devices and helps deliver quality patient care. Devices sterilized with ethylene oxide range from wound dressings to more specialized devices, like stents, as well as kits used in routine hospital procedures or surgeries that include multiple components made of different materials. However, the FDA recognizes the environmental considerations that are currently impacting manufacturers’ ability to use this process. To that end, and in light of the recent state EPA order, the FDA has been working to quickly and proactively secure alternative locations and methods for the sterilization of devices that were previously processed at the Willowbrook facility in order to mitigate potential product supply issues. We’re taking steps to prevent patient harm from potential device shortages that could delay or disrupt critical care.  At the same time, we’re undertaking new efforts to encourage innovative and improved sterilization options. First, the FDA is actively working to prevent potential medical device shortages that may arise from the closing of the Willowbrook facility. Upon learning that the facility was ordered to stop sterilizing hundreds of various types of medical devices, we immediately reached out to the medical device manufacturers that relied on Sterigenics’ services to better understand which devices were affected by the facility ceasing operations and to assess the potential impact to patients. We are working directly with manufacturers, as needed, to help them transition to another sterilization site or sterilization method. According to the FDA’s Establishment Registration & Device Listing database, Sterigenics listed a total of 594 types of devices that undergo an ethylene oxide sterilization process at the Willowbrook facility and therefore by the closure. These include products such as sutures, clamps, knives, stents and needles. At this time, the FDA isn’t aware of any device shortages attributable to the Willowbrook facility closure. We’re closely monitoring the situation and will continue to provide updates.  There’s a risk that for some sterile packaged products that are already in distribution, existing supply may be diminished—or even depleted—as health care facilities use their inventory before alternative arrangements can be made accommodate the sterilization of new products coming off manufacturing lines. This could lead to temporary or “spot” shortages of some products until sterilization can be restored. In addition, the FDA is aware that Viant, another contract sterilizer, recently that their Grand Rapids ethylene oxide sterilization facility is scheduled to close later this year after from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for air quality issues. According to the FDA’s Establishment Registration & Device Listing database, Viant listed a total of 46 types of devices that undergo an ethylene oxide process at the Grand Rapids facility which, in the future, by the closure of the facility. These include devices such as catheters and surgical mesh. Because of the shutdown of the Sterigenics Willowbrook facility and the planned closing of the Viant Grand Rapids facility, the FDA is urging medical device manufacturers that use these facilities to begin assessing any potential downstream impacts of the closures on device distribution through their supply chain to end users (such as health care facilities), and ultimately on patient care. We’re also encouraging medical device manufacturers to consider alternative contract sterilizers that can process their devices. We’ve already communicated the steps manufacturers need to take to make changes to their contract sterilizers and maintain availability of their devices. We’re committed to working closely with manufacturers to expedite our review of any site change submissions to ensure they can efficiently switch to other contract sterilizer facilities while still ensuring safe and effective sterilization of their devices. Second, while every effort is being taken to prevent a potential shortage, we’re monitoring the situation closely and stand ready to act quickly with strategies intended to limit the impact of device supply interruptions on patients. These include looking at making devices available from other sources if needed. Early awareness of a potential shortage enables us to be proactive and develop a plan to mitigate its effects on patient care. We’re taking steps to proactively identify potential shortages. Among other steps, we’ve established a so that any user, patient or organization within the supply chain that’s aware of a delay in distribution of new product, and/or anticipates a shortage, can notify us. Third, as we continue to monitor any shortages associated with facility closings, we’re also working with stakeholders—including sterilization experts, medical device manufacturers and other government agencies—to identify innovative ways to sterilize medical devices that don’t raise the same concerns as those identified at the Willowbrook facility. About half of all sterilized medical devices undergo sterilization using ethylene oxide. In view of the concerns about the environmental impact of this method, we recognize the importance of identifying new and improved ways of sterilizing medical devices. We’ve already started exploring ways we can continue to ensure sterilization processes are safe and effective, and evolving with the current science. This includes considering validation of methods that would support using lower levels of currently-used agents like ethylene oxide gas, thereby reducing environmental exposure risks, while still ensuring effective device sterilization. There may also be ways to employ—and eventually validate—new sterilization agents or processes that don’t come with the same environmental risks but still enable the safe and effective sterilization of devices. To advance these efforts, we plan to discuss this issue with the infection control community at the May 2019 . We will also host a public advisory committee meeting that will be announced later this year dedicated to discussing how best to encourage innovation in medical device sterilization. In addition, later in 2019, we will announce a public innovation challenge to encourage development of novel sterilization methods, which could include new devices or new modalities that are safe and effective for sterilizing medical devices. Finally, we recognize that new challenges may arise from the current situation. To help ensure transparency and communication about the use of ethylene oxide in medical device sterilization, today we to act as a resource on this sterilization method as well as any future actions we take regarding shortages or other activities associated with this issue. We’ll update this site as new information becomes available. We’ll continue to act to help ensure patient access to safe and effective medical devices. And we’ll work directly with manufacturers, contract sterilizers, government agencies and other public health stakeholders to evaluate potential impacts and take additional steps as needed to avert device shortages. We’re seeking to not only limit the immediate impact of these facility closures, but also to identify new and improved methods for medical device sterilization.

{"title": "FDA advances landmark policy changes to modernize mammography services and improve their quality", "date": "March 27, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced important new steps to modernize breast cancer screening and help empower patients with more information when they are considering important decisions regarding their breast health care. For the first time in more than 20 years of regulating mammography facilities, the agency is proposing amendments to key regulations that would help improve the quality of mammography services for millions of Americans. Today’s actions would expand the information mammography facilities must provide to patients and health care professionals, allowing for more informed medical decision-making. It would also modernize mammography quality standards and better position the FDA to enforce regulations that apply to the safety and quality of mammography services. “Breast cancer is one of the most worrisome health concerns facing women. The FDA plays a unique and meaningful role in the delivery of quality mammography to help patients get accurate screening to identify breast health problems early, when they can be effectively addressed,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “As part of our overall commitment to protecting the health of women, we’re proposing new policies to modernize our oversight of mammography services, by capitalizing on a number of important advances in mammography, like the increased use of 3-D digital screening tools and the need for more uniform breast density reporting. We’re committed to making sure patients have access to high quality mammography. Today’s proposed rule would help to ensure patients continue to benefit from advances in new tools and robust oversight of this field.” According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), approximately 12.4 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. NCI estimates that, in 2018, more than 260,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 40,920 women died of the disease. Aside from skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the second leading cause of death. Additionally, mammography can be an important tool in detecting male breast cancers. According to the NCI, breast cancer may occur in men at any age, but usually occurs in men between 60-70 years of age. The FDA’s proposal would amend regulations issued under the (MQSA), which Congress passed to ensure quality mammography for early breast cancer detection. The MQSA authorizes FDA oversight over mammography facilities, including their accreditation, certification, annual inspections and enforcement of standards to help ensure mammography facilities provide quality care. Among the proposed amendments to improve communication and medical decision making is the addition of breast density information to the mammography lay summary letter provided to patients and to the medical report provided to their referring health care professionals. Mammograms of dense breasts—breasts with a higher proportion of fibroglandular tissue compared to fatty tissue—can be difficult to interpret because the dense tissue can obscure signs of breast cancer and lower the sensitivity of the image. Dense breasts have also been identified as a risk factor for developing breast cancer. The FDA is proposing specific language that would explain how breast density can influence the accuracy of mammography and would recommend patients with dense breasts talk to their health care provider about high breast density and how it relates to breast cancer risk and their individual situation. The proposed amendments also seek to enhance information provided to health care professionals by proposing to codify three additional categories for the assessments of mammograms, including adding an important category titled “known biopsy proven malignancy,” which would help identify for health care professionals those cases where cancer being mammographically evaluated for therapy are already known and identified. In addition, under the proposed regulations, both health care professionals and patients would receive in their reports and lay summary letters more detailed identifying information about the mammography facility to aid in post-exam communications. “The FDA is committed to advancing efforts that improve the health of women. We believe the proposed rule would help empower patients and health care professionals by proposing improvements to the information facilities communicate to them, helping to facilitate the sometimes difficult conversations about potential risks for breast cancer,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “Given that more than half of women over the age of 40 in the U.S. have dense breasts, helping to ensure patient access to information about the impact that breast density and other factors can have on the risk for developing breast cancer is an important part of a comprehensive breast health strategy. Today’s proposed amendments are part of the agency’s broader commitment to supporting new innovations and methods to prevent, detect and treat cancer. We are dedicated to working across the agency and with stakeholders to provide patients with tools and information to fight breast cancer effectively.” The proposed amendments would also modernize mammography quality standards and better position FDA to enforce the MQSA regulations and take action when violations are found. Some of these proposed changes include: “Once finalized, these proposed amendments will enhance our oversight of mammography facilities, including in the key area of enforcement and patient communication,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “While the majority of certified mammography facilities are dedicated to providing high levels of patient care, today’s proposed regulations would enhance the FDA’s ability to communicate directly, if needed, with patients and their health care professionals in cases where facilities did not meet our quality standards and are not adequately communicating with patients about their facillities’ deficiencies. This is intended to help ensure important information that could affect decisions about patient care—such as the potential need for further evaluation or a repeat of a mammogram—is communicated as quickly as possible.” The proposed rule is available online at for public comment for 90 days from publication. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Expressly stating that the FDA can directly notify patients and their health care professionals, should facilities be unwilling or unable to do so, that mammography at a facility did not meet quality standards and that reevaluation or repeat of the mammogram at another certified facility may be needed; Requiring that only digital accessory components specifically FDA approved or cleared for mammography be used, or that facilities use components that otherwise meet the requirements under the rule; Strengthening record-keeping requirements to minimize information loss and improve access to and transfer of patient mammography records."},
{"title": "FDA approves new oral testosterone capsule for treatment of men with certain forms of hypogonadism", "date": "March 27, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Jatenzo (testosterone undecanoate), an oral testosterone capsule to treat men with certain forms of hypogonadism. These men have low testosterone levels due to specific medical conditions, such as genetic disorders like Klinefelter syndrome or tumors that have damaged the pituitary gland. Jatenzo should not be used to treat men with “age-related hypogonadism,” in which testosterone levels decline due to aging, even if these men have symptoms that appear to be related to low testosterone. Jatenzo’s benefits do not outweigh its risks for that use. “Jatenzo’s oral route of administration provides an important addition to current treatment options available for men with certain hypogonadal conditions who up until now have most commonly been treated with testosterone products that are applied to the skin or injected,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D, M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “But it’s important to emphasize that this drug should not, like other testosterone treatments, be used to treat older men with ‘age-related hypogonadism.’ The benefits of testosterone therapy, including Jatenzo, have not been established for this use, and Jatenzo’s effects on raising blood pressure can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death in this population.” The efficacy of Jatenzo was demonstrated in a four-month clinical trial involving 166 men with hypogonadism. Study participants initially were given Jatenzo at a dose of 237 mg twice per day, and the dose was adjusted downward or upward to a maximum of 396 mg twice per day on the basis of testosterone levels. Eighty-seven percent of Jatenzo-treated men achieved an average testosterone level within the normal range, which was the primary study endpoint. Jatenzo contains a boxed warning on its labeling stating that the drug can cause blood pressure to rise, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. Health care providers should consider a patient’s individual heart disease risks and ensure that blood pressure is adequately controlled before prescribing Jatenzo; they should also periodically monitor patient blood pressure during treatment. Jatenzo is currently one of two testosterone products that have this boxed warning. The FDA is requiring all testosterone product manufacturers to conduct blood pressure postmarketing trials to more clearly address whether these products increase blood pressure. Common side effects, occurring in more than 2 percent of patients in the Jatenzo clinical trial, included headache, an increase in hematocrit (red blood cell count), a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and nausea. An increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) was also observed. Patients should have their hematocrit, cholesterol and PSA monitored regularly to check for changes. Those with benign prostate hyperplasia should be monitored for worsening of symptoms. The FDA granted the approval of Jatenzo to Clarus Therapeutics.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps to strengthen agency’s safety requirements aimed at mitigating risks associated with transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products", "date": "March 27, 2019", "contents": " As the FDA continues to forcefully confront the opioid crisis, rationalizing prescribing practices and ensuring safe and appropriate use of these powerful medications remains a cornerstone of our efforts. More appropriate prescribing can reduce the rate of new addiction and mitigate the serious, and sometimes deadly, risks associated with opioids. To confront this crisis, we continue to use all facets of our regulatory authority. This includes requiring Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programs to ensure the benefits of a medication outweigh its risks. In the context of opioids, these REMS programs and related requirements can in part help us strike a balance between reducing the rate of new addiction by decreasing exposure to opioids and rationalizing prescribing, while still enabling appropriate access to those patients who have a legitimate medical need for these medicines. Last fall, for example, we approved the , which we expanded to include immediate-release opioid analgesics intended for use in an outpatient setting. Among other things, this broadened the REMS training to cover information about acute and chronic pain management, safe use of opioids, and other non-opioid or non-drug treatments. While the Opioid Analgesics REMS program covers most prescription opioids, other classes of opioid products like the transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) medicines have their own REMS program to mitigate the serious risks specific to those medications. TIRF medicines are a class of products indicated to manage breakthrough pain in adults with cancer who are routinely taking other opioid pain medicines to treat around-the-clock pain. Breakthrough pain comes on suddenly for short periods of time and is not alleviated by a patient’s normal pain management plan. TIRF medicines can fill an important medical need for a small and carefully selected group of patients who are opioid-tolerant. But these products also have significant risks associated with their use. That is why the FDA has had a REMS in place since 2011 to ensure the benefits of TIRF products outweigh their risks. The REMS was intended to ensure that TIRF products are prescribed only to appropriate patients. The REMS also included measures that were designed to: limit use to opioid-tolerant patients; avoid inappropriate conversion between TIRF medicines; reduce accidental exposure; and educate prescribers, pharmacists, and patients on the potential for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose. We know there are questions in the community about whether the REMS program is appropriately designed to mitigate the risks of TIRF products. As part of our ongoing commitment to the safe use of these products, the FDA held a in August 2018 to seek the committees’ feedback on any possible modifications to the TIRF REMS goals and requirements. We also sought input on the adequacy of the evaluations conducted in the REMS assessments to determine whether the TIRF REMS goals are being met. Today we are announcing new steps to strengthen the TIRF REMS to better ensure the safe use of these products. It’s important to underscore that outpatient utilization of TIRF products has substantially declined in recent years. In 2012 – the first full year the REMS was implemented – an estimated 14,400 patients received TIRF prescriptions dispensed from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies. By 2017, utilization declined to an estimated 4,700 patients who received TIRF dispensed prescriptions, and TIRF products accounted for only 0.02 percent of all opioid analgesic prescriptions dispensed from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies. Despite the decline in the use of these medicines, the historical data on the prescribing of TIRF products indicates that prescribing behavior is not consistent with the strict labeling. To the extent that some of these prescribing practices still persist, even as prescriptions declined sharply, that causes the FDA concern. Specifically, while many of the operational and functional compliance aspects of the REMS appeared to be working, the program wasn’t fully achieving its intended public health purpose. Based on data submitted to the FDA in REMS assessments, while prescribers consistently appear to be knowledgeable about the risks and the safe use of TIRF medicines, an estimated 35 to 55 percent of patients treated with a TIRF medicine were not opioid-tolerant and many received a TIRF prescription for an unapproved use to treat other types of pain. The prescribing of these medicines for non-FDA approved uses to non-opioid-tolerant patients tells us that there may be a disconnect between prescriber knowledge and prescribing behavior. While physicians can prescribe a drug “off-label” when they believe it is medically appropriate for a particular patient, physicians should take heed of the narrow, approved indication of these products and the agency’s strongest warning, called a contraindication, on labeling stating it should not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients. While all opioids pose serious risks, these are not your typical opioids and should be prescribed by providers with extra care and attention. It’s clear more needs to be done to better ensure the safe use of these medicines, mitigate their risks, and assure appropriate prescribing. Today we’re taking important new steps to help improve the safety of TIRF medicines under the TIRF REMS. We’re moving forward to modify the TIRF REMS to ensure the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. We are to the manufacturers of these nine products notifying them of the following required changes to the REMS, including: These changes are significant. They’re intended to drive more judicious prescribing and better patient awareness of the serious risks of these medications. For example, TIRF medicines are contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients due to the risk of respiratory depression and death, which may occur in these patients. The current TIRF REMS requires only that prescribers attest to their understanding that patients must be opioid tolerant before using a TIRF medicine; it currently does not include a requirement that prescribers document that a patient is opioid tolerant before prescribing a TIRF medicine. Although outcomes of use in patients who are not opioid-tolerant are lacking, the agency is concerned about serious adverse events that could occur if TIRF medicines are used in patients that are not opioid-tolerant. That’s why we’re now requiring verification of opioid tolerance with each prescription written and dispensed to provide greater assurance that only opioid tolerant patients are treated with a TIRF medicine in order to lower the risks for adverse events, including overdose and death. This is in addition to the patient-prescriber agreement form (PPAF) that patients initiating therapy with a TIRF medicine for outpatient use are required to sign with the prescriber, acknowledging their understanding of the risks, safe use, safe storage, and disposal of their TIRF medicine. Finally, the FDA has acknowledged the challenges with the available data sources and limitations of spontaneous reporting of adverse events for such a small patient population. To further address these challenges, the agency is requiring that a patient registry be added to the REMS to monitor patients for serious adverse events including overdose (both fatal and non-fatal). By adding a patient registry to the TIRF REMS, we’ll be better able to evaluate adverse events and the safe use of TIRF medicines. Today’s action is the first step in the process to update the REMS over the next year. We’re committed to finalizing these meaningful modifications to the TIRF REMS program as quickly as possible. We may also take other new actions. This matter is a high priority. We’ll continue to take steps to ensure the TIRF REMS program is achieving its goal of assuring safe use and mitigating the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and accidental exposure associated with these medicines. At the same time, we must also make sure that patients suffering from significant pain, in this case, adults with breakthrough cancer pain, have access to appropriate medications and aren’t unduly burdened in getting the treatment they need.

Requiring that prescribers document a patient’s opioid tolerance concurrently with each prescription of a TIRF medicine for outpatient use. Requiring inpatient pharmacies to develop internal policies and procedures to verify opioid tolerance in patients who require TIRF medicines while hospitalized. Requiring that a TIRF medicine be dispensed for outpatient use with evidence or other documentation of safe use conditions, including concurrent documentation of opioid tolerance.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatments for heart disease caused by a serious rare disease, transthyretin mediated amyloidosis", "date": "May 06, 2019", "contents": " On May 3, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) capsules for the treatment of the heart disease (cardiomyopathy) caused by transthyretin mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults. These are the first FDA-approved treatments for ATTR-CM. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax have the same active moiety, tafamidis, but they are not substitutable on a milligram to milligram basis and their recommended doses differ. “Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is a rare, debilitating and often fatal disease,” said Norman Stockbridge, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The treatments we’re approving today are an important advancement in the treatment of the cardiomyopathy caused by transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.” ATTR is caused by the buildup of abnormal deposits of specific proteins known as amyloid in the body's organs and tissues, interfering with their normal functioning. These protein deposits most frequently occur in the heart and the peripheral nervous system. Heart involvement can result in shortness of breath, fatigue, heart failure, loss of consciousness, abnormal heart rhythms and death. Involvement of the peripheral nervous system can result in a loss of sensation, pain, or immobility in the arms, legs, hands and feet. Amyloid deposits can also affect the kidneys, eyes, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The efficacy of Vyndaqel and Vyndamax in treating ATTR-CM was shown in a clinical trial of 441 patients randomized to receive Vyndaqel or a placebo. After an average of 30 months, the survival rate was higher in the Vyndaqel group than in the placebo group. Vyndaqel was also shown to reduce the number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular problems. The number of patients in clinical studies was small, but no drug-associated side effects have been identified. Tafamidis may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women taking Vyndaqel or Vyndamax should discuss pregnancy planning and prevention with their health care professional. The FDA granted Vyndaqel designations. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax each received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. Approval of Vyndaqel and Vyndamax were granted to FoldRx, a subsidiary of Pfizer.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for children with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder", "date": "May 06, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ruzurgi (amifampridine) tablets for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in patients 6 to less than 17 years of age. This is the first FDA approval of a treatment specifically for pediatric patients with LEMS. The only other treatment approved for LEMS is only approved for use in adults. “We continue to be committed to facilitating the development and approval of treatments for rare diseases, particularly those in children,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This approval will provide a much-needed treatment option for pediatric patients with LEMS who have significant weakness and fatigue that can often cause great difficulties with daily activities.” LEMS is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between nerves and muscles and causes weakness and other symptoms in affected patients. In people with LEMS, the body’s own immune system attacks the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and muscles) and disrupts the ability of nerve cells to send signals to muscle cells. LEMS may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, but more commonly occurs in patients with cancer such as small cell lung cancer, where its onset precedes or coincides with the diagnosis of cancer. LEMS can occur at any age. The prevalence of LEMS specifically in pediatric patients is not known, but the overall prevalence of LEMS is estimated to be three per million individuals worldwide. Use of Ruzurgi in patients 6 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of the drug in adults with LEMS, pharmacokinetic data in adult patients, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to identify the dosing regimen in pediatric patients and safety data from pediatric patients 6 to less than 17 years of age. The effectiveness of Ruzurgi for the treatment of LEMS was established by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study of 32 adult patients in which patients were taking Ruzurgi for at least three months prior to entering the study. The study compared patients continuing on Ruzurgi to patients switched to placebo. Effectiveness was measured by the degree of change in a test that assessed the time it took the patient to rise from a chair, walk three meters, and return to the chair for three consecutive laps without pause. The patients that continued on Ruzurgi experienced less impairment than those on placebo. Effectiveness was also measured with a self-assessment scale for LEMS-related weakness that evaluated the feeling of weakening or strengthening. The scores indicated greater perceived weakening in the patients switched to placebo. The most common side effects experienced by pediatric and adult patients taking Ruzurgi were burning or prickling sensation (paresthesia), abdominal pain, indigestion, dizziness and nausea. Side effects reported in pediatric patients were similar to those seen in adult patients. Seizures have been observed in patients without a history of seizures. Patients should inform their health care professional immediately if they have signs of hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, hives, itching, fever, swelling or trouble breathing. The FDA granted this application designations. Ruzurgi also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.

{"title": "FDA takes action to protect women’s health, orders manufacturers of surgical mesh intended for transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse to stop selling all devices", "date": "April 16, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today ordered the manufacturers of all remaining surgical mesh products indicated for the transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) to stop selling and distributing their products in the U.S. immediately. The order is the latest in a series of escalating safety actions related to protecting the health of the thousands of women each year who undergo surgery transvaginally to repair POP. The FDA has determined that the manufacturers, Boston Scientific and Coloplast, have not demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices, which is the premarket review standard that now applies to them since the agency reclassified them in class III (high risk) in 2016. As part of the 2016 reclassification, manufacturers were required to submit and obtain approval of premarket approval (PMA) applications, the agency's most stringent device review pathway, in order to continue marketing their devices in the U.S. The companies will have 10 days to submit their plan to withdraw these products from the market. “In order for these mesh devices to stay on the market, we determined that we needed evidence that they worked better than surgery without the use of mesh to repair POP. That evidence was lacking in these premarket applications, and we couldn’t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long term,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  “Patient safety is our highest priority, and women must have access to safe medical devices that provide relief from symptoms and better management of their medical conditions. The FDA has committed to taking forceful new actions to enhance device safety and encourage innovations that lead to safer medical devices, so that patients have access to safe and effective medical devices and the information they need to make informed decisions about their care.” Surgical mesh has been used by surgeons since the 1950s to repair abdominal hernias. In the 1970s, gynecologists began implanting surgical mesh for abdominal repair of POP and, in the 1990s, for the transvaginal repair of POP. In 2002, the first mesh device for transvaginal repair of POP was cleared for use as a class II moderate-risk device. About 1 in 8 women has surgery to repair POP over her lifetime, and a subset of these surgeries are completed transvaginally with the use of surgical mesh. However, the percentage of women undergoing transvaginal POP mesh procedures has decreased in recent years after the FDA began about the risks associated with using transvaginal mesh used for POP repair. Two manufacturers have been marketing three surgical mesh products for transvaginal repair of POP. In reviewing the PMAs submitted by the two manufacturers, the agency determined they failed to provide an adequate assessment of the long-term safety of these devices and failed to demonstrate an acceptable long-term benefit of these devices compared to transvaginal surgical tissue repair without the use of mesh (native tissue repair). Since the FDA has not received sufficient evidence to assure that the probable benefits of these devices outweigh their probable risks, the agency has concluded that these products do not have a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Boston Scientific filed two PMAs for its devices, the Uphold LITE Vaginal Support System and the Xenform Soft Tissue Repair System, and Coloplast filed a PMA for its device, Restorelle DirectFix Anterior. In February 2019, the FDA to solicit input from experts on how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP. The panel recommended that to support a favorable benefit-risk profile, the effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP should be superior to native tissue repair at 36 months and the safety outcomes for surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP should be comparable to native tissue repair. The FDA agreed with these recommendations, and because such data were not provided by manufacturers in their PMAs, the FDA decided not to approve them. Even though these products can no longer be used in patients moving forward, Boston Scientific and Coloplast are required to continue follow-up of the subjects already enrolled in their 522 studies. Women who have had transvaginal mesh placed for the surgical repair of POP should continue with their annual and other routine check-ups and follow-up care. There is no need to take additional action if they are satisfied with their surgery and are not having complications or symptoms. Patients should notify their health care professionals if they have complications or symptoms, including persistent vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic or groin pain or pain with sex. They should also let their health care professional know if they have surgical mesh, especially if they plan to have another surgery or other medical procedures. Women who were planning to have mesh placed transvaginally for the repair of POP should discuss other treatment options with their doctors. Over the past several years, the FDA has seen a significant increase in the number of reported adverse events associated with the use of surgical mesh for transvaginal POP repair. As a result, the agency has taken several, escalating actions for the protection of public health: July 2011: FDA issued an , which identified concerns and issued new recommendations about the use of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP. September 2011: FDA convened a public meeting of the to discuss the benefits and risks of this use. Subsequently, the FDA issued 131 orders to conduct postmarket surveillance studies (“ ”) to 34 manufacturers of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP. Most manufacturers elected to stop marketing surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP after receiving their 522 orders. January 2016: The FDA completed its for transvaginal repair of POP into the highest risk class  of devices (class III), which requires premarket approval (PMA) applications, the agency's most stringent device review pathway, in order to stay on the market. July 5, 2018: This was the deadline for applications to be filed for any surgical mesh marketed for transvaginal POP repair. Manufacturers that did not file PMAs by this deadline were required to withdraw their products from the market. Those that did were allowed to keep their products on the market while the FDA reviewed their PMAs. February 12, 2019: The FDA convened an to share the available evidence and seek expert opinion on how to evaluate the risks and benefits of these devices. The committee was asked to provide scientific and clinical input on assessing the effectiveness, safety, and benefit-risk of mesh placed transvaginally in the anterior vaginal compartment, as well as identifying the appropriate patient population and physician training needed for these devices. The action today is part of the FDA’s overarching commitment to advance women's health and improve access to safe and effective medical devices. This includes the issuance of a and the agency’s work to implement a new active surveillance system to quickly detect new device safety signals and efforts to strengthen Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs), which link different real-world data sources to generate clinical evidence about medical products used by patients. In particular, the FDA is focusing on addressing clinical questions on device therapies that are unique to women, such as the treatment of uterine fibroids and pelvic floor disorders including POP. The FDA partnered with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Urogynecologic Society, the National Library of Medicine and others on this effort, known as the Women’s Health Technologies CRN, or WHT-CRN. Providing patients with access to the safest possible medical devices on the market to meet their health care needs remains a top FDA priority.

{"title": "FDA approves first generic naloxone nasal spray to treat opioid overdose", "date": "April 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted final approval of the first generic naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray, commonly known as Narcan, a life-saving medication that can stop or reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. The agency is also planning new steps to prioritize the review of additional generic drug applications for products intended to treat opioid overdose, along with the previously announced action to help facilitate an “In the wake of the opioid crisis, a number of efforts are underway to make this emergency overdose reversal treatment more readily available and more accessible. In addition to this approval of the first generic naloxone nasal spray, moving forward we will prioritize our review of generic drug applications for naloxone. The FDA has also taken the unprecedented step of helping to assist manufacturers to pursue approval of an over-the-counter naloxone product and is exploring other ways to increase the availability of naloxone products intended for use in the community, including whether naloxone should be co-prescribed with all or some opioid prescriptions to reduce the risk of overdose death,” said Douglas Throckmorton, M.D., deputy center director for regulatory programs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “All together, these efforts have the potential to put a vital tool for combatting opioid overdose in the hands of those who need it most – friends and families of opioid users, as well as first responders and community-based organizations. We’re taking many steps to improve availability of naloxone products, and we’re committed to working with other federal, state and local officials as well as health care providers, patients and communities across the country to combat the staggering human and economic toll created by opioid abuse and addiction.” Today’s approval is the first generic naloxone nasal spray for use in a community setting by individuals without medical training; however, generic injectable naloxone products have been available for years for use in a health care setting. The FDA also has previously approved a brand-name naloxone nasal spray and an auto-injector for use by those without medical training. While business and other considerations may impact how quickly this product becomes available, today’s approval is an important step for the agency as it works toward expanding access to this live-saving drug. The FDA also held a meeting in December to solicit input and advice on strategies to increase the availability of naloxone products intended for use in the community. According to the , almost 400,000 people died from an opioid overdose from 1999 to 2017, and on average, more than 130 Americans die every day from overdoses involving opioids, a class of drugs that include prescription medications such as fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine, as well as illegal drugs such as heroin or drugs sold as heroin. Drugs like heroin often contain fentanyl or derivatives of fentanyl. When someone overdoses on an opioid, it can be difficult to revive the person to full consciousness, and breathing may become shallow or stop completely – leading to death without medical intervention. If is administered quickly, it can counter the overdose effects, usually within minutes. However, it is important to note that it is not a substitute for immediate medical care, and the person administering naloxone nasal spray should seek further immediate medical attention on the patient’s behalf. As part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis and expand the use of naloxone, in April 2017, the Department announced its to Combat the Opioids Crisis. Those efforts include: better addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services; better data; better pain management; better targeting of overdose reversing drugs; and better research. In April 2018, Surgeon General VADM Jerome Adams issued an encouraging more individuals, including family, friends and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose to carry naloxone. In December 2018, ADM Brett P. Giroir, M.D., Assistant Secretary for Health and the Secretary’s Senior Advisor for Opioid Policy, released for health care providers and patients detailing how naloxone can help save lives. One of the ways the FDA is working to increase access to this life-saving treatment is through the approval of generic naloxone products. As part of HHS’ public health emergency to address the ongoing opioid crisis, the FDA will grant priority review to all abbreviated new drug applications for products indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose. As part of the priority review, sponsors will receive shorter goal dates or standard goal dates with earlier reviewer deadlines; enhanced agency communication with sponsors; and expanded agency engagement similar to Generic Drug User Fee Act enhancements for complex products, such as pre-submission and midcycle meetings. The FDA has determined that further expanding availability of and access to overdose reversal drugs could help address the public health emergency. More generally, in an effort to promote competition to help reduce drug prices and improve access to safe and effective generic medicines for Americans, the agency is taking a number of new steps as part of its Drug Competition Action Plan. These steps include important work to improve the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and address barriers to generic drug development. The FDA also remains focused on several additional priorities to address the opioid crisis, including: decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies; supporting treatment of those with opioid use disorder; and improving enforcement and assessing benefit-risk. Naloxone nasal spray does not require assembly and delivers a consistent, measured dose when used as directed. This product can be used for adults or children and is easily administered by anyone, even those without medical training. The drug is sprayed into one nostril while the patient is lying on his or her back and can be repeated if necessary. The use of naloxone nasal spray in patients who are opioid-dependent may result in severe opioid withdrawal characterized by body aches, diarrhea, increased heart rate (tachycardia), fever, runny nose, sneezing, goose bumps (piloerection), sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness and increased blood pressure. The FDA tentatively approved this generic drug product on June 8, 2018. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. has received final FDA approval to market generic naloxone nasal spray. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, on FDA’s continued confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine", "date": "April 22, 2019", "contents": " The FDA is a public health agency that always strives to use the best available scientific evidence to promote and protect the well being of individuals. It deeply concerns us when we see preventable diseases such as measles or mumps reemerging in the United States and threatening our communities. The World Health Organization recently named vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health. In this time of multiple measles outbreaks, and as we approach , we want to underscore our continued confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that are highly successful at preventing – in some cases, nearly eradicating – preventable diseases. The MMR vaccine has been approved in the United States for nearly 50 years to prevent measles, mumps and rubella (also known as German Measles). As a result of its use, measles and rubella were completely eradicated in the United States, and mumps cases decreased by 99%. Large well-designed studies have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and have demonstrated that administration of the vaccine is not associated with the development of autism. However we’re seeing an increasing number of in communities across the country, including those in New York, New Jersey, Washington, California, and Michigan. Considered eradicated within the U.S. since 2000, measles has persisted in other areas of the world where the vaccine is not as readily available, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. Unvaccinated U.S. residents may be exposed to measles while they are abroad and bring the disease back into the U.S. and spread it to others. Worldwide, about 20 million people get measles each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have also been reported. It’s an urgent public health priority to monitor these diseases and raise awareness of the importance of timely immunizations, especially as outbreaks are taking hold among unvaccinated populations in this country. These diseases start with symptoms that may mirror the common cold, but they can cause serious illness and in some cases, even death. Measles – a respiratory disease that causes a skin rash, fever, cough and runny nose – can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children. It is one of the most contagious diseases and can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain and death. In fact, one to two children out of every 1,000 who contract measles dies from complications of the disease and one in four people who get measles need to be hospitalized. Mumps causes fever, headache, loss of appetite and the well-known sign of swollen cheeks and jaw from the swelling of the salivary glands. Complications, though rare, can include deafness and meningitis (an infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). Rubella, once a common disease that occurred primarily among young children, causes fever, rash, and -- mainly in women -- arthritis. Rubella infection during pregnancy can also lead to birth defects. We cannot state strongly enough – the overwhelming scientific evidence shows that vaccines are among the most effective and safest interventions to both prevent individual illness and protect public health. Vaccinating against measles, mumps and rubella not only protects us and our children, it protects people who can’t be vaccinated, including children with compromised immune systems due to illness and its treatment, such as cancer. We do not take lightly our responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and work diligently to assess safety and effectiveness of all licensed vaccines for their intended uses. The MMR vaccine is very effective at protecting people against measles, mumps, and rubella. It also prevents complications caused by these diseases. And we have nearly 50 years of experience and evidence supporting that fact. In fact, according to the CDC, two doses of the MMR vaccine beginning at 12 months of age (the recommended dosing schedule) are 97% effective against measles, 88% effective against mumps, and 97% effective for rubella. Like many medical products, the MMR vaccine has known potential side effects that are generally mild and short-lived, such as rash and fever. If parents have concerns about these side effects, we recommend that they speak with their health care providers about the benefits and risks of vaccines, along with the potential consequences of not vaccinating against diseases. The FDA will continue to closely monitor these outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases alongside our federal partners at CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services, and will provide any new information about vaccine safety or effectiveness to the public. But just to be clear, the FDA has determined that the MMR vaccine is both safe and effective in preventing these diseases. We join our colleagues at HHS, CDC, National Institutes of Health and state and local health departments across the country in the continued effort to encourage vaccinations against these preventable diseases. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on new steps to help reduce risks associated with surgical staplers for internal use and implantable staples ", "date": "April 23, 2019", "contents": " As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s mission to protect the public health, outlined in our , we are committed to continuing to strengthen and modernize how we take action to address device safety issues that emerge in the post-market in a more timely and effective way. Also as part of our public health mission, it is important that we communicate with the public when we become aware of issues stemming from the use, or misuse, of medical devices. Last month, we the public and health care professionals to concerns we identified—in medical device reports, recalls database and published scientific literature—regarding surgical staplers for internal use and implantable surgical staples. Surgical staplers and staples for internal use are devices used in a wide range of surgical applications, including gastrointestinal, gynecologic and thoracic surgeries to remove part of an organ, to cut through organs and tissues, and to create connections between structures. These widely used devices facilitate surgical procedures and may shorten surgical procedure time compared to manual suturing. The agency alert both warned about the risks we identified and provided recommendations to help improve the safe use of these devices given their health benefits in a surgical setting. The alert was prompted by a large number of medical device reports associated with the use of these devices. The agency’s analysis showed that from January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018, the FDA received more than 41,000 individual adverse event reports (known as medical device reports, or MDRs), which included more than 32,000 malfunctions, more than 9,000 serious injuries and 366 patient deaths. The most commonly reported problems in these adverse event reports include an opening of the staple line or malformation of staples, misfiring, difficulty in firing, failure of the stapler to fire the staple, and misapplied staples (e.g., user applying staples to the wrong tissue or applying staples of the wrong size to the tissue). Alerting the public and health care professionals was an important step, but as we shared at that time, we believe additional actions must be taken to better ensure the safe and effective use of these devices. To that end, today we are announcing three new efforts with the goal of better protecting patients from the malfunctions, injuries and deaths associated with these devices. First, we are proposing to increase the regulatory requirements of surgical staplers for internal use by reclassifying them into a higher-risk category that requires the review and clearance of a premarket notification submission prior to marketing. The issued today would reclassify surgical staplers for internal use from Class I (low risk) to Class II (moderate risk) medical devices with special controls. Currently, as Class I medical devices, manufacturers of surgical staplers for internal use are not required to submit a premarket notification to the FDA prior to marketing. At the time of the device’s original classification in 1988, surgical staplers had been in common use in medical practice for many years, and the FDA believed, based on the available information, that general controls were sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of those devices and the devices were exempt from premarket notification the following year. Reclassification of surgical staplers for internal use as a Class II device would allow the agency to require premarket review and allow us to establish special controls, such as mandatory performance testing of various mechanical features, demonstration of usability and labeling comprehension such as assessing health care professionals’ ability to properly select and use the device according to the labeling, and specific labeling elements supporting the safe use of the device. Second, today the agency also issued the draft guidance, “ ,” to help manufacturers ensure their labeling provides adequate information for use, including relevant hazards, contraindications, and other information under which practitioners can use the device safely and for its intended purpose. The guidance recommends that manufacturers include contraindications for use, such as not using on necrotic (dead) tissue, and warnings, such as avoiding use on large blood vessels. Additionally, the guidance also recommends that the directions for use contain clear instructions, such as how to evaluate staple line formation and integrity and that the product labeling for surgical staplers and staples for internal use clearly identify key technical characteristics and performance parameters, such as the types of tissues on which the device may be used. Helping manufacturers identify appropriate information to include in their product labeling will ultimately help better protect patients by helping health care professionals better understand the appropriate use and the risks of these devices. Finally, as announced in March, the agency intends to hold a of the FDA’s General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of its Medical Devices Advisory Committee on May 30, 2019 to discuss whether the current pathway for manufacturers to market surgical staplers for internal use is appropriate and receive expert input on the proposed reclassification and draft guidance. As part of the panel meeting, we will present a comprehensive analysis of all the MDRs received for surgical staplers for internal use and implantable staples, as well as other relevant information. The actions issued today reflect the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of medical device safety. As part of the , the FDA has alerted the public when safety issues are identified, as evidenced by our response to safety issues with and silicone injections as well as . The agency is also working with stakeholders to develop registries, including as part of the , to provide more complete evidence in clinical areas to enhance the agency’s ability to identify and act upon safety issues with medical devices. Combined, we believe these steps will help better protect patients by ensuring that these devices are safe and effective for their intended use in surgeries. We remain dedicated to closely monitoring reports of adverse events associated with surgical staplers for internal use and implanted staples and will take additional action, as needed, to protect patients. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA permits marketing of first medical device for treatment of ADHD", "date": "April 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first medical device to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prescription-only device, called the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) System, is indicated for patients ages 7 to12 years old who are not currently taking prescription ADHD medication and is the first non-drug treatment for ADHD granted marketing authorization by the FDA. “This new device offers a safe, non-drug option for treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients through the use of mild nerve stimulation, a first of its kind,” said Carlos Peña, Ph.D., director of the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s action reflects our deep commitment to working with device manufacturers to advance the development of pediatric medical devices so that children have access to innovative, safe and effective medical devices that meet their unique needs.” ADHD is a common disorder that begins in childhood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior and very high levels of activity. The diagnosis of ADHD requires a comprehensive evaluation by a health care professional. For a person to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be chronic or long-lasting, impair the person’s functioning and cause the person to fall behind normal development for his or her age. The Monarch eTNS System is intended to be used in the home under the supervision of a caregiver. The cell-phone sized device generates a low-level electrical pulse and connects via a wire to a small patch that adheres to a patient's forehead, just above the eyebrows, and should feel like a tingling sensation on the skin. The system delivers the low-level electrical stimulation to the branches of the trigeminal nerve, which sends therapeutic signals to the parts of the brain thought to be involved in ADHD. While the exact mechanism of eTNS is not yet known, neuroimaging studies have shown that eTNS increases activity in the brain regions that are known to be important in regulating attention, emotion and behavior. The stimulation should feel like a tingling sensation on the skin, and the device should be used in the home under the supervision of a caregiver during periods of sleep. Clinical trials suggest that a response to eTNS may take up to 4 weeks to become evident. Patients should consult with their health care professional after four weeks of use to assess treatment effects. The Monarch eTNS System’s efficacy in treating ADHD was shown in a clinical trial that compared eTNS as the sole treatment, or monotherapy, to a placebo device. A total of 62 children with moderate to severe ADHD were enrolled in the trial and used either the eTNS therapy each night or a placebo device at home for four weeks. The trial's primary endpoint was improvement on a clinician-administered ADHD Rating Scale, ADHD-RS.  ADHD-RS scales are used to monitor severity and frequency of ADHD symptoms. A higher score is indicative of worsening symptoms. The ADHD-RS uses questions about the patient’s behavior, such as whether they have difficulty paying attention or regularly interrupt others. The trial showed that subjects using the eTNS device had statistically significant improvement in their ADHD symptoms compared with the placebo group. At the end of week four, the average ADHD-RS score in the active group decreased from 34.1 points at baseline to 23.4 points, versus a decrease from 33.7 to 27.5 points in the placebo group. The most common side effects observed with eTNS use are: drowsiness, an increase in appetite, trouble sleeping, teeth clenching, headache and fatigue. No serious adverse events were associated with use of the device. The Monarch eTNS System should not be used in children under seven years of age. It should not be used in patients with an active implantable pacemaker or with active implantable neurostimulators. Patients with body-worn devices such as insulin pumps should not use this device. The eTNS System should not be used in the presence of radio frequency energy such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because it has not been tested in an MRI machine, or cell phones, because the phone’s low levels of electromagnetic energy may interrupt the therapy. The FDA reviewed the Monarch eTNS System through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Monarch eTNS System to NeuroSigma. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement from FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Melinda K. Plaisier, on agency’s new steps to strengthen the process of initiating voluntary recalls", "date": "April 23, 2019", "contents": " Voluntary recalls are one of the most important safety tools overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They are a vital means to protect public health and typically are the quickest way to remove defective or potentially harmful food, medical, and consumer products from the market. The FDA plays an important role in the recall process, closely overseeing FDA-regulated companies during their voluntary recalls to help ensure public health is protected. But our work doesn’t stop there. When it comes to recalls and how quickly they are executed, consumers depend on the FDA to protect their health and we work quickly because it could minimize consumer exposure to a health risk and prevent consumers from being injured. We know that in order for a recall to be effective and timely, it’s crucial that companies be prepared in advance to take all necessary steps for when a recall is initiated. That’s why the FDA’s work is also keenly focused on guiding companies on steps needed to ready their facilities and staff for possible recall situations. As part of these efforts, today we’re issuing a that, when finalized, will provide industry with clear information on ways to prepare, plan, and work with the FDA to ensure voluntary recalls are initiated properly and promptly. The draft guidance, “Initiation of Voluntary Recalls Under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C,” includes recommendations in three key areas: Today’s guidance reflects the latest step in the agency’s ongoing commitment to working with companies to quickly act to protect consumers from potentially dangerous products. It builds upon 18 months of proactive and systematic improvements to the FDA’s recall processes, during which the agency alerted companies of the situations where the FDA would disclose certain supply chain and retail distribution information during certain human and animal food recalls; provided for human and animal foods, which answered common questions about the mandatory food recall provisions; and issued on public warnings and notifications of recalls for all FDA-regulated products outlining specific circumstances in which the agency would expect a company to issue a public warning about a voluntary recall. The agency has also adopted new policies for moving forward with rapidly posting new recalls to the , which is a web listing of all recalls monitored by the FDA. Together, these actions have resulted in more timely information being available to consumers, allowing them to protect themselves and their families. There are many examples of this over the last 12 months across the FDA-regulatory portfolio. This includes , advisories, or consumer warnings related to many products like . The agency also issued the first mandatory recall order for , and released detailed retail distribution information during a associated with an outbreak of Salmonella infections, so consumers could better identify where the recalled food may have been purchased or distributed. These efforts have made important improvements toward our goal of quickly executing recalls and reaching consumers with timely information to limit the impact of potentially dangerous products. But we know there is more that needs to be done. Moving forward, the agency will continue its efforts to improve recalls, and will encourage the use of new technologies and other tools that can assist in those efforts. The FDA will also continue to refine and improve our ability to quickly communicate information to the public on recall situations. We remain committed to learning from every recall and seeking out opportunities for improved processes, education and awareness in order to ensure that American consumers are kept safe from potentially dangerous products. These collective efforts will help the agency to prevent future recalls and work quickly with companies to remove products from the market when an issue does arise. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Proper training of personnel is perhaps one of the most important elements to effectively executing a recall. The draft guidance provides recommendations for companies who manufacture or distribute FDA-regulated products to adopt in readying their staff for potential recall situations. Specifically, this new draft guidance advises companies on ways to best identify and train appropriate personnel on their responsibilities during a recall, establish a recall communications plan, and identify what FDA reporting requirements there may be, among other things. Thorough and organized record-keeping is especially important as the agency continues its efforts to improve recalls through product traceability by tapping into modern approaches such as blockchain technology to further advance our mission of protecting public health. The draft guidance also advises companies on the importance of properly coding their products and maintaining distribution records in order to conduct the most effective recall possible Written recall initiation procedures help to minimize delays created by uncertainty. For companies that initiate a recall, using initiation procedures can help reduce the amount of time a defective or potentially harmful product is on the market and that in turn reduces the potential exposure to consumers. For consignees of a company that initiates a recall, these procedures can help extend the recall quickly throughout the distribution chain. The guidance recommends that firms consider preparing and maintaining written recall initiation procedures to swiftly ensure their recalled products are removed from the market. These procedures should clearly describe the appropriate actions to take when a decision is made to initiate a recall. They should also help ensure that necessary actions are not overlooked and may minimize the disruptive effect a recall can have on a company’s operations."},
{"title": "FDA launches public education campaign to encourage safe removal of unused opioid pain medicines from homes ", "date": "April 25, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the launch of a new education campaign to help Americans understand the important role they play in removing and properly disposing of unused prescription opioids from their homes. This new initiative is part of the FDA’s continued efforts to address the nationwide opioid crisis and aims to help decrease unnecessary exposure to opioids and prevent new addiction. The “ ” campaign is targeting women ages 35-64, who are most likely to oversee household health care decisions and often serve as the gatekeepers to opioids and other prescription medications in the home. “The epidemic of opioid addiction and overdose is one of the greatest public health tragedies we’re facing as a nation, and no community is immune,” said Amy Abernethy, M.D., principal deputy commissioner at the FDA. “We know that many people who misuse prescription opioids report getting them from a friend or family member. If every household removed prescription opioids once they’re no longer medically needed for their prescribed purpose it would have a major impact on the opioid crisis’ hold on American families and communities.” Prescription opioids are powerful, pain-reducing medicines that can help patients successfully manage pain when prescribed for the right condition and when used properly. When misused or abused, however, these drugs can cause serious harm, including addiction, overdose and death. In 2017, retail pharmacies dispensed more than 191 million opioid prescriptions to almost 60 million patients, either as first-time prescriptions or refills. As many as 90% of these patients reported not finishing what was prescribed to them, potentially leaving millions of unused prescription opioids in medicine cabinets and elsewhere in U.S. homes if not disposed of properly. During that same year, 47,600 people died from an overdose involving opioids. According to data from the from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, half of people who misused prescription opioids got them from a friend or family member. As part of the “Remove the Risk” campaign, the FDA launched a new toolkit of materials, available in English and Spanish, which include: television, radio and print (PSAs); fact sheets; social media graphics and posts; and website badges that can be used by individuals, health care providers and organizations. These materials are being made available free of charge to news media, health care providers, consumer groups, and other organizations working to combat the opioids crisis. The agency also recently updated information on safe disposal of unused prescription opioids on its webpage, which can help individuals determine the best disposal option for their situation. “Far too many Americans, both teens and adults, are gaining access to opioids for the first time from the medicine cabinets of their parents, relatives and friends. Millions of unused opioid pills should not be readily available and easily accessible in our homes,” said Douglas Throckmorton, M.D., deputy director of regulatory programs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Our ‘Remove the Risk’ campaign serves to both educate Americans on this issue and provide them with easy-to-follow steps to take so they can immediately remove prescription opioids from their homes and avoid unintentionally contributing to the risk of misuse or abuse of these drugs by a friend or loved one.” Medicine take-back options are the preferred way to dispose of most types of unneeded medicines safely, including opioids. Authorized locations may be in retail pharmacies; hospital or clinic pharmacies; and law enforcement facilities. Some authorized collection sites may also offer mail-back programs or “drop-boxes” to assist patients in safe disposal of their unused medicines. The next is on April 27, 2019. Additionally, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities ( ) Act gave the FDA the authority to require manufacturers to develop disposal technologies (such as a mail-back pouches) to make it even easier for patients to get unused medicines out of their homes. This is just one of the many efforts being made to combat the opioids tragedy. The FDA remains committed to addressing this national crisis on all fronts, with a significant focus on decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies; and taking action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioid products. The opioid epidemic is one of the Department’s top priorities. In 2017, HHS launched a 5-point Opioid Strategy to empower local communities on the frontlines. This strategy consists of better (1) prevention, treatment and recovery services; (2) data on the epidemic; (3) pain management; (4) targeting of overdose-reversing drugs; and (5) research on pain and addiction."},
{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for pediatric patients with lupus", "date": "April 26, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Benlysta (belimumab) intravenous (IV) infusion for treatment of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – often referred to as simply “lupus” – a serious chronic disease that causes inflammation and damage to various body tissues and organs. This is the first time that the FDA has approved a treatment for pediatric patients with SLE. Benlysta has been approved for use in adult patients since 2011. “The agency expedited the review and approval of this application because Benlysta IV fulfils an unmet need for therapies, specifically in pediatric patients with SLE. While there is no cure for lupus, treatment can help our youngest patients control their disease with the hope of improving their quality of life and lowering their risk of long-term organ damage and disability,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. While childhood-onset SLE is rare, when diagnosed, it is generally more active in children and adolescents than adult patients, particularly in how it impacts organs such as the kidneys and central nervous system. As a result of the disease starting early in life, pediatric patients with SLE are at a higher risk for developing increased organ damage and complications from the disease as well as adverse events from the life-long treatments usually required. The efficacy of Benlysta IV for the treatment of SLE in pediatric patients was studied over 52 weeks in 93 pediatric patients with SLE. The proportion of pediatric patients achieving the composite primary endpoint, the SLE response index (SRI-4), was higher in pediatric patients receiving Benlysta IV plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy. Pediatric patients who received Benlysta IV plus standard therapy also had a lower risk of experiencing a severe flare, as well as longer duration of time until a severe flare (160 days versus 82 days). The drug’s safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in pediatric patients were consistent with those in adults with SLE. Benlysta’s doctor and patient information includes a warning for mortality, serious infections, hypersensitivity and depression, based on data from the clinical studies in adults with SLE. The drug should not be administered with live vaccines. The manufacturer is required to provide a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risks associated with Benlysta. The most common side effects in patients included nausea, diarrhea and fever. Patients also commonly experienced infusion reactions, so healthcare professionals are advised to pre-treat patients with an antihistamine. The FDA granted this application a designation. The FDA granted the approval of Benlysta to GlaxoSmithKline. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves device to help increase access to more lungs for transplant", "date": "April 26, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved a device, called Xvivo Perfusion System with Steen Solution Perfusate, that can temporarily ventilate, oxygenate, and pump (perfuse) preservation solution through lungs that were initially thought to be unacceptable for transplant. The device allows the transplant team to perform a more careful assessment of lung function to get a better sense of how the organs are working when they are perfused with a solution outside the body to better determine whether the lungs can then be viable for transplant. The Xvivo Perfusion System was originally granted marketing authorization in 2014 under a (HDE), a regulatory pathway that limits the device’s use to a maximum of 8,000 patients per year. Today’s approval through the FDA’s more stringent premarket approval (PMA) pathway does not limit yearly patient use of the device, thereby allowing an increased number of lungs to be available for transplant and potentially increasing the number of patients who can benefit from this technology. Lung transplantation remains the only known life-saving treatment for end-stage lung disease, but many patients die while waiting for suitable lungs to become available for transplant. On average, only 15 percent of lungs obtained from deceased donors are suitable for transplantation. This is because the physiological function of a large number of donor lungs is questionable due to, for example, poor lung quality or possible injury, or there is inadequate time to find a suitable donor-recipient match. Approximately 2,530 lung transplants were performed last year, according to the “Sadly, too many patients on transplant lists die waiting for suitable lungs. Providing patients with access to safe medical devices that have the potential to be lifesaving remains a top FDA priority, and we support the development of innovative technologies that can increase the donor organ pool for transplant patients in need of suitable lungs,” said Benjamin Fisher, Ph.D., director of the Division of Reproductive, Gastro-renal, Urological Devices at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The Xvivo Perfusion System works by allowing marginal quality lungs that initially failed to meet standard transplant criteria to be ventilated, oxygenated and perfused at a standard normal body temperature for up to five hours. This provides an opportunity for surgeons to reassess transplant suitability, allowing them to transplant a certain percentage of lungs that were initially deemed to be unsuitable. The device consists of a perfusion cart with mechanical and electrical components that ventilate, oxygenate and perfuse the lungs with a lung preservation solution. The FDA evaluated data from a study involving 332 sets of donor lungs that were allocated into three groups: one group served as the control and were lungs initially deemed suitable for transplant that were provided to 116 recipients after standard preservation; one group were lungs initially deemed unsuitable for transplant and, after being perfused with the Xvivo Perfusion System, were implanted into 110 recipients; the third group were perfused with the Xvivo Perfusion System and were still deemed not suitable after the perfusion, and therefore were not implanted into patients. The one-year survival rate was 94 percent for the control group compared to 86.4 percent for the lung perfusion patients. The difference in rates was not deemed to be clinically significant. The most common adverse events associated with this device include acute rejection, bronchial complications, respiratory failure and infections.

{"title": "FDA warns manufacturers of products labeled as homeopathic for putting consumers at risk with significant violations of manufacturing quality standards", "date": "May 14, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has posted warning letters to five companies who produce products labeled as homeopathic for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. Four of the warning letters pertain to companies who jointly produced a product labeled as homeopathic that posed a significant safety risk to consumers because their purportedly sterile products were not shown to be sterile. An additional letter outlines a company’s failure to have systems in place to assure proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes. “It’s our public health obligation to protect consumers from unsafe products. Our manufacturing requirements are designed to ensure the quality and safety of drugs distributed to American consumers, and the FDA expects companies to manufacture and label their products appropriately,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “When products labeled as homeopathic are contaminated or contain potentially harmful ingredients, we will take action so consumers are not put at risk.” Products labeled as homeopathic have not been approved by the FDA for any use and may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Products labeled as can be made from a wide range of substances, including ingredients derived from plants; healthy or diseased animal or human sources; minerals and chemicals. These products are often marketed as natural, safe and effective alternatives to approved prescription and nonprescription products and are widely available in the marketplace. These unapproved drugs may cause significant and even irreparable harm if they are poorly manufactured, which can lead to contamination, or may contain active ingredients that are not adequately tested or disclosed to patients. The warning letters issued to , doing business as WePackItAll, describe failures to conform to CGMP requirements due to improper methods, facilities or controls for manufacturing, processing and packing. These companies jointly manufacture and package Puriton Eye Relief Drops, which are labeled as homeopathic. The FDA tested multiple samples and found these eye drops were non-sterile, which could lead to an eye infection, and had a high pH level, which could lead to eye injury such as glaucoma, corneal scarring and loss of vision. Kadesh issued a recall in November 2018 due to non-sterile production conditions at the manufacturing facility. was issued to Newton Laboratories for human drug CGMP and misbranding violations, as well as unapproved new animal drug violations. Some of the company’s products labeled as homeopathic are indicated for treating conditions in infants and children, and they are manufactured from ingredients such as nux vomica, belladonna, aconitum napellus, and gelsemium sempervirents that pose potentially toxic effects. For example, nux vomica contains strychnine, which is a highly toxic, well-studied poison that is used to kill rodents. Producing such a product without proper manufacturing controls may lead to super-potent drugs, which could be a potential poisoning risk for consumers. Earlier this year, the FDA issued separate warning letters to additional companies regarding violative products labeled as homeopathic: In December 2017, the FDA that prioritizes enforcement and regulatory actions involving drug products labeled as homeopathic and marketed without the required FDA approval that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. Given the concerns about the proliferation of potentially ineffective and harmful products labeled as homeopathic, the FDA stated when it issued the draft guidance that it would consider taking additional enforcement and/or regulatory actions, consistent with its current compliance policies, in the interest of protecting the public.

{"title": "Remarks on World Food Safety Day: ‘Food Safety Is Everyone’s Business’", "date": "June 07, 2019", "contents": " This first World Food Safety Day is a recognition that when it comes to food safety, we all win or lose together. In a global food system and with the increase in international travel, if foodborne disease exists somewhere in the world, it can exist anywhere in the world. No nation stands alone when faced with the challenge of protecting its citizens from foodborne illnesses. This truth is reflected in the theme of this inaugural event: “Food Safety Is Everyone’s Business.” I am honored to be representing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today. This is a wonderful opportunity to talk about the importance of food safety and how we can work together to improve quality of life for people in every nation. But first I would like to acknowledge and thank the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for all that they do to advance food safety worldwide. Food safety is an issue that transcends international borders. Foodborne pathogens do not recognize boundaries or borders, so when it comes to protecting consumers, neither should we. It’s estimated that foodborne illnesses are responsible for 420,000 deaths annually around the world, 125,000 of them in children under age 5. Think about that. It’s not just a sad statistic – it’s a public health call to action. It’s almost twice the estimated deaths in the earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010. It’s roughly 229 times the people who died when Hurricane Katrina hit our Gulf Coast in 2005. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3,000 people die each year from foodborne illnesses. Taking a world view of food safety is important for all consumers because food moves globally, as do we. In the U.S., about 15 percent of the food supply is imported from more than 200 countries or territories, including 32 percent of the fresh vegetables, 55 percent of the fresh fruit and at least 94 percent of the seafood that Americans eat each year. And these statistics are not unique to the U.S. – similar patterns are seen around the world and global movement of foods continues to grow. The FDA fully supports this united effort to advance the prevention, detection and mitigation of foodborne risks. But this is not something we can do just one day a year; our mission is one that must be carried out every day, anywhere where food is produced, 365 days a year. To protect the food supply, we must use a variety of tools. Rules, response and compliance activities are common, and critical, tools for food policy makers and regulators. But as nations we must go beyond merely having rules and regulations. We must also foster, support, and strengthen food safety cultures on our farms, in our food facilities, and in our nations. We will not make dramatic improvements in reducing the global burden of foodborne disease without strengthening a culture of food safety and doing more to influence and change human behavior. In fact, I like to say, simply put, food safety equals behavior. So, what is a food safety culture? It’s patterned ways of thought and behavior that characterize a social group, whether it be a farm, a company, a geographic region, or a nation. Those patterned ways of thought and behavior can be learned through socialization processes and persist through time. You see, I believe food safety can be caught, not only taught. I also believe that a food safety culture is a prerequisite to an effective food safety management system. How do we promote food safety culture as public health agencies and organizations? To me, it’s a matter of always thinking and speaking about food safety to food producers and each other about the idea that food safety transcends regulations and borders. It’s the idea that food safety is a belief that all consumers matter, that we care about their safety and the safety of their friends and families. It’s also about being guided by the “why” food safety matters. There are such compelling reasons that whenever we don’t address the “why,” it’s a lost opportunity. Why are we doing this? Because consumers deserve to be confident in the safety of the food supply. Because farmers and food manufacturers want their customers, as well as their business, to thrive. But most importantly: Because too many of our citizens are still getting sick and dying of foodborne illness – and we can do better. No, we MUST do better. As we look towards the future, there’s no question that we must all continue to work on creating a stronger, global culture of food safety, together. At FDA, our work towards this goal is set in the framework of three missions set forth by Congress and FDA to prevent foodborne illnesses, create a modern food safety system, and empower consumers to make informed choices about their diet. First, there is the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) that FDA has been implementing since it was signed into law in 2011. Under FSMA, science and risk-based standards have been put in place for the production, packing, holding and transportation of foods. Many of companies that produce our foods – no matter where in the world they are located -- must systematically recognize what hazards may exist and routinely take steps to prevent them. Second, Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless and I recently announced an initiative called a New Era of Smarter Food Safety that will leverage new and emerging technologies to further our food safety goals. This is a new approach to food safety, one that explores the use of the technologies being used in society and business sectors all around us, such as blockchain, sensor technology, the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, to create a more digital, traceable, and safer food system. And one that creates shared value for all stakeholders -- farmers, food producers, regulators, consumers, and the planet. Third, there’s FDA’s Nutrition Innovation Strategy that FDA announced in 2018 to empower consumers with information and facilitate industry innovation to create healthier products, to help combat the growing burden of chronic disease. This strategy includes implementing the updated Nutrition Facts label and requiring that certain menus and vending machine labels include calorie information. These are just two of the ways in which FDA is helping consumers find the information they need to make healthful food choices. In closing, I look forward to discussing how we can work together as the citizens of all nations, large and small, to ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable, and healthful foods. There’s a role for everyone in this important work. A World Food Safety Day page at fda.gov has valuable information about how to participate in spreading the word about food safety and what you can do to avoid foodborne illnesses. No matter where we live or where we work, we’re all serving the same boss. The consumer. So, let’s get to work, because they’re counting on us and food safety is everyone’s business, 365 days a year. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement from Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D., and Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas on steps to usher the U.S. into a new era of smarter food safety", "date": "April 30, 2019", "contents": " Today’s technology-focused world has morphed the way our society operates, creating a highly complex and globally interconnected landscape that is fundamentally changing the way foods move from farm to table. We’ve evolved from a system that sources foods from “around the corner” to “around the world” and are now redefining the “last mile” with the emergence of various direct-to-home food delivery models. Thanks to these advances, a wide variety of foods are now available to Americans conveniently, year-round, and at affordable prices. But it doesn’t stop here. We expect to see more innovation in the agriculture, food production, and food distribution systems in the next 10 years than we’ve seen in the past 20, which will continue to provide an even greater variety of food options and delivery conveniences to American consumers. With this ever-changing landscape, we know we must continue preparing to take advantage of new opportunities and address potential risks. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we’ve already made great strides modernizing and further safeguarding the U.S. food supply chain with implementation of the (FSMA). Since FSMA was signed into law in 2011, the FDA has proposed and finalized critical regulations that have established science- and risk-based standards for the production and transportation of domestic and imported foods. The FDA has also had great success leveraging technology to advance food safety, especially in the use of new analytical tools. For example, we developed and led the domestic and international effort to build a first-of-its-kind network of laboratories that can sequence the genomes of foodborne pathogens and then upload the genomic sequence and the geographic location from which the pathogen was gathered, into a publicly accessible database. Known as the , this new tool is a paradigm-changing development to facilitate foodborne outbreak investigations. While these new regulations and developments have enhanced our oversight of the food supply and its safety to a level on par with our nation’s growing needs, we recognize that it’s time to look to the future of food safety once again, with a view that builds on the progress we’re making with our regulatory framework, but also leverages the use of new and emerging technologies to create a more digital, traceable and safer system. That’s why, today, we’re announcing a “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” to augment our efforts implementing important FSMA requirements while also leveraging, among other things, the use of new and emerging technologies. To kick off this new focus, we intend to develop a “Blueprint for a New Era of Smarter Food Safety.” The Blueprint will address several areas, including traceability, digital technologies and evolving food business models. We’ll also be holding a public meeting later this year to discuss smarter food safety, seek stakeholder input and share ideas on our overall strategy and the specific initiatives. While we have new tools that can more rapidly identify what foods may be causing illnesses, we know that food safety is a never-ending race to detect and respond to problems, while continually assessing better ways to prevent them. When it comes to food traceability, many in the food system utilize a largely paper-based system of taking one step forward to identify where the food has gone and one step back to identify the source. When you look at how other industries digitally track the movement of planes, ride sharing and delivery of packaged goods, it becomes clear that we must explore how these types of technologies could improve tracking when it comes to food. The use of new and evolving digital technologies may play a pivotal role in tracing the origin of a contaminated food to its source in minutes, or even seconds, instead of days or weeks, when contamination does occur. Access to information during an outbreak about the origin of contaminated food will help us conduct more timely root cause analysis and apply these learnings to prevent future incidents from happening in the first place. To help accomplish this goal, our new era of smarter food safety work will explore opportunities and specific actions to evaluate new technologies and upgrade our abilities to rapidly track and trace food through the supply chain. This work will support and be aligned with other track and trace efforts at the agency, such as our focused on tracking the movement of medicines throughout the supply chain as part of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Tracing is only one area where technology can enhance food safety. We’ll also be looking at how to leverage emerging technologies and other approaches that are being used in society and business sectors all around us, such as distributed ledgers, sensors, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. We will assess how these technologies could create a more digital, transparent and safer food system while also addressing consumer demands for quick access to information about where their foods come from, how they’re produced and, if the food is the subject of an ongoing recall. To this end, today we’re sharing that the FDA plans to conduct a new pilot that will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to explore new ways to enhance the agency’s review of imported foods at ports of entry to ensure they meet U.S. food safety standards. The number of import food lines is increasing year after year and applying the best predictive and analytical tools will help ensure we’re targeting the greatest risks to protect consumers. This pilot will build upon FDA initiatives already under way, which are also looking at how use of these new technologies may be able to help us continue meeting our public health mission. With the rise in e-commerce of food, the way we get our food from farm to home continues to evolve. As customers are increasingly asking for food to be delivered to their homes, there are new methods, packaging materials, temperature control approaches and nodes (such as “last mile” delivery in cars and bikes) in the e-commerce food delivery system. These evolving business models present food safety challenges as well as novel considerations around regulatory framework and oversight at the federal, state and local level. Our Blueprint will discuss areas for collaboration in this space as we work to identify the appropriate standard of care in this rapidly growing sector. We know that we cannot embark upon this journey alone and, to be successful, it’s equally important for food companies of all sizes and technology firms, as well as local and federal agencies and other stakeholders, to join us in this effort. We know it must also include the important elements of collaboration, leadership, creativity and culture. We both learned from working with the FDA, while on the other side of the fence, that there’s a lot industry and government – whether it’s the states or the Federal government – can do to advance food safety. Tackling food safety is a shared responsibility, and there’s much more we can do together and in a manner that benefits people, food companies, and the planet. That’s why we’re excited about holding a public meeting later this year to bring various stakeholders to the table and learn more about what others are doing to create a smarter, safer food system. As we continue moving toward this new era of smarter food safety, we won’t lose sight of the fact that smarter food safety is more than just technology. It’s about embracing technological advancements in ways that build upon the vision FSMA set forth. We must use that vision – our vision – to work together to keep consumers in every town, in every county and in every state safe. Ultimately, for our journey toward a new era of smarter food safety to be a success, all those involved in making food products available to consumers must walk in lockstep on this path. Whether you’re in the private or public sector, whether you’re at the state or Federal level, we’re all working for the same bosses – American consumers – so let’s work together to keep their food safe. They’re counting on us to do so. So, welcome to the new era of smarter food safety that is people-led, FSMA-based and technology-enabled!

{"title": "FDA, FTC take action to protect kids by citing four firms that make, sell flavored e-liquids for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on their behalf ", "date": "June 07, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission today issued to four firms that manufacture, advertise and offer for sale or distribution several flavored e-liquid products for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on each company’s behalf, including failure to include the required nicotine warning statement. The warning letters are just one aspect of the FDA’s designed to limit youth access to all tobacco products, with a particular focus on youth e-cigarette use. “Years of progress to combat youth use of tobacco is now threatened by an epidemic of e-cigarette use by kids, and unfortunately research shows many youth are mistaken or unaware of the risks and the presence of nicotine in e-cigarettes. That’s why it’s critical we ensure manufacturers, retailers and others are including the required health warning about nicotine’s addictive properties on packages and advertisements – especially on social media platforms popular with kids,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Under my leadership, the FDA will continue to tackle the troubling epidemic of e-cigarette use among kids. This includes limiting youth access to, and appeal of, flavored tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars, taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market these products or sell them to minors, and educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. We cannot and will not risk a generation of youth to a lifetime of nicotine addiction. We appreciate the FTC joining us on these and other actions to protect youth from the dangers of nicotine and tobacco products.” Social media influencers are individuals with a large number of online followers that often help to promote products on behalf of certain brands or companies. Through social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, influencers on behalf of posted content touting the flavored e-liquid products or recommending their social media followers try the products without including the required nicotine warning statement. The FDA has determined that the e-liquid products labeled and/or advertised on behalf of the companies in these social media posts, or in two cases, on the companies’ own social media accounts are misbranded because they fail to include the statement, “WARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical,” a that the FDA has enforced since Aug. 10, 2018. The FTC joined the FDA on the warning letters under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive advertising. “These letters are a reminder that companies who use social media influencers to promote their products must comply with all applicable advertising requirements,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Moreover, ads must disclose material health or safety risks – in this case, the fact that nicotine is highly addictive.” The products that are subject to the warning letters include: Solace Black Sea Salt Blueberry, Solace Black Tropical Freeze, Solace Salts Peach, Solace Salts Strawberry, and Solace Salts Dragon Fruit Menthol; Hype City Vapors Mango Candy and Hype City Vapors Berry Lemonade; HMBL SALT Mango Pineapple, HMBL SALT Blue Blood High, HMBL SALT Strawberry Kiwi, HMBL SALT Apple Jay Jay, HMBL SALT 99 Pink Balloons, and HMBL SALT Watermelon Patch; and Artist Liquids Peanut Butter Rocket Nicotine Salt, Artist Liquids Nice Melons Nicotine Salt, Artist Liquids Cotton Cookies Nicotine Salt, Artist Liquids Strawberry Clouds Nicotine Salt, and Artist Liquids Blue Label Nicotine Salt. The FDA and the FTC have requested responses from each of the companies within 15 working days. The companies are directed to inform each agency of the specific actions taken to address each agency’s concerns. The warning letters also state that failure to correct violations may result in further action such as seizure or injunction. More than 3.6 million middle and high school students across the country were current (within the past 30 days) e-cigarette users in 2018, according to the conducted by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a dramatic increase of 1.5 million students from the previous year. The data also showed that youth who used e-cigarettes also were using them more frequently, and they were using flavored e-cigarette products more often, than in 2017. The increased popularity of e-cigarettes among youth raises a number of other health concerns: risk of addiction to nicotine early on in life; potential harm from nicotine exposure to the developing adolescent brain; and exposure to chemicals associated with adverse health effects. In addition, research shows that, compared with non-users, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to transition to conventional cigarettes ‒ risking a lifetime of addiction to smoking and resulting smoking-attributable disease. To address this growing use among kids, over the past year the FDA has taken actions to combat the illegal sales of e-cigarettes to youth, and other actions to target kid-friendly marketing that increases the appeal of these products to youth. From April 2018 through April 2019, the FDA issued more than 3,950 warning letters and more than 665 civil money penalties (fines) to brick-and-mortar and online retailers for illegal sales of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) and e-liquid products to minors. The FDA also – many in conjunction with FTC – against more than 15 firms for selling e-liquids that resemble kid-friendly foods, such as juice boxes, cereal and candy; and the FDA continues to investigate whether companies are introducing new e-cigarettes in violation of premarket authorization requirements. Last year, the FDA also “The Real Cost” Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign – a comprehensive effort targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. The campaign features hard-hitting advertising on digital and social media sites popular among teens, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages in high schools across the nation. The FDA also to expand distribution of youth e-cigarette prevention posters to every public and private high school in the U.S. and released for doctors, youth groups, churches, state and local public health agencies, and others on the dangers of youth e-cigarette use. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to further the discussion and understanding around how we can help aid those kids who are already addicted to the nicotine in e-cigarettes quit. This includes holding a and a separate to discuss efforts to eliminate youth e-cigarette use as well as other tobacco product use, with a focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation and the issues impacting the development of such therapies for youth.

{"title": "FDA permits marketing of first medical device for relief of pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome in patients 11-18 years of age", "date": "June 07, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first medical device to aid in the reduction of functional abdominal pain in patients 11-18 years of age with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when combined with other therapies for IBS. IBS is a condition affecting the large intestines that can cause abdominal pain and discomfort typically related to bowel movements. “This device offers a safe option for treatment of adolescents experiencing pain from IBS through the use of mild nerve stimulation,” said Carlos Peña, Ph.D., director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s action reflects our ongoing commitment to advancing the development of pediatric medical devices so that children and adolescents have access to safe and effective medical devices that meet their needs.” The IB-Stim is a prescription-only device comprised of a small single-use electrical nerve stimulator that is placed behind the patient’s ear. It contains a battery-powered chip that emits low-frequency electrical pulses to stimulate branches of certain cranial nerves continuously for five days, at which time it is replaced. Stimulating nerve bundles in and around the ear is thought to provide pain relief. Patients can use the device for up to three consecutive weeks to reduce functional abdominal pain associated with IBS. IBS is a group of symptoms that occur together, including repeated pain in the abdomen and changes in bowel movements, which may be diarrhea, constipation or both. With IBS, the symptoms can be present without any visible signs of damage or disease in the digestive tract. The FDA reviewed data from a published clinical study that included 50 patients 11-18 years of age with IBS - 27 patients were treated with the device and 23 patients received a placebo device. The study measured change from baseline to the end of the third week in worst abdominal pain, usual pain and Pain Frequency Severity Duration (PFSD) scores, which incorporate multiple aspects of pain experience. Changes in bowel movements were not evaluated. During the study, patients were allowed to continue stable doses of medication to treat chronic abdominal pain. Worst pain at baseline was similar between the treatment and placebo groups. A repeated measures analysis showed a greater change (improvement) in worst pain from baseline to week three in the treatment group. This effect was also seen at weeks one and two. Greater change was also demonstrated in composite PFSD scores from baseline to week three in the IB-Stim group compared to the placebo group. IB-Stim treatment resulted in at least a 30% decrease in usual pain at the end of three weeks in 52% of treated patients compared to 30% of patients who received the placebo, and at least a 30% decrease in worst pain in 59% of treated patients compared with 26% of patients who received the placebo. During the study, six patients reported mild ear discomfort and three patients reported adhesive allergy at the site of application. The device is contraindicated for patients with hemophilia, patients with cardiac pacemakers or those diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris (a condition in which skin cells build up and form scales and itchy, dry patches). The FDA reviewed the IB-Stim through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Similar versions of this device for other uses were previously granted marketing authorization by the FDA. The was permitted for marketing in 2017 as an aid to reduce the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The FDA first cleared a version of the device, known as the , in 2014 for use in acupuncture. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the IB-Stim to Innovative Health Solutions.

{"title": "FDA approves first generics of Lyrica", "date": "July 22, 2019", "contents": " On July 19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved multiple applications for first generics of Lyrica (pregabalin) for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, for the management of postherpetic neuralgia, as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 17 years of age and older, for the management of fibromyalgia, and for the management of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. “Today’s approval of the first generics for pregabalin, a widely-used medication, is another example of the FDA’s longstanding commitment to advance patient access to lower cost, high-quality generic medicines,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The FDA requires that generic drugs meet rigorous scientific and quality standards. Efficiently bringing safe and effective generics to market so patients have more options to treat their conditions is a top priority for the FDA.” Pregabalin must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that contains important information about its uses and risks. Warnings include the risk of angioedema (swelling of the throat, head and neck), which may be associated with life-threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Hypersensitivity reactions such as hives, dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and wheezing can occur. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if the drug is rapidly discontinued. Antiepileptic drugs, including pregabalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Additionally, pregabalin may cause peripheral edema (swelling of hands or legs) so caution should be exercised when co-administering it with thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents. Pregabalin may cause dizziness and drowsiness and impair ability to drive or operate machinery. The most common side effects reported in the clinical trials for Lyrica in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, swelling, blurred vision, weight gain and abnormal thinking (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). The FDA granted approvals for the generic versions of Lyrica to Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Alkem Laboratories, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, MSN Laboratories Ltd., Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sciegen Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Teva Pharmaceuticals.

{"title": "Statement on the FDA’s benefit-risk framework for evaluating opioid analgesics", "date": "June 20, 2019", "contents": " Addressing the crisis of opioid addiction is an issue of great concern for our nation and remains a top public health priority for the FDA. The agency continues to take new steps to confront this crisis, while also paying careful attention to the needs of patients in accessing appropriate pain management. Opioids present unique challenges: they have benefits when used as prescribed yet have very serious risks and can cause enormous harm when misused and abused. We’ve had a robust public debate over the years, engaging the pain and addiction communities, academia, health care professionals and policymakers on developing a framework to help evaluate the benefit-risk considerations specific to prescription opioids that not only serves the patient community but the public health as a whole. Above all, our goal has been to ensure product approval and removal decisions are science-based and that the agency’s benefit-risk framework considers not only the outcomes of prescription opioids when used as prescribed but also the public health effects of inappropriate use. Today, as part of the FDA’s ongoing commitment to assess the benefit-risk of opioid pain medications, the agency issued a new draft guidance, “ ,” which describes the application of the benefit-risk assessment framework that the agency uses in evaluating applications for opioid analgesic drugs and summarizes the information that can be supplied by opioid analgesic drug applicants to assist the agency with its benefit-risk assessment, including considerations about the broader public health effects of these products in the context of this crisis. The agency is also the 2014 draft guidance, “Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products.” Following discussions with industry and other stakeholders, we believe that the FDA can provide more targeted information in critical areas of development using a series of new draft guidances to speed development. Benefit-risk assessment is the foundation for the FDA’s regulatory review of human drugs and biologics. These assessments capture the evidence, uncertainties and reasoning used by the agency to arrive at its regulatory decisions. The FDA evaluates a drug product’s risks against its benefits in the context of the use indicated in the labeling. When it comes to regulating opioids, we do so with an understanding that any action taken by the agency should be considered in light of the opioid crisis. To inform the consideration of how best to assess the benefit-risk of opioid pain medicines, the agency commissioned a study from the to identify additional actions the FDA should consider to address the opioid crisis with a particular focus on approaches the agency can take to improve its benefit-risk framework for opioids to support a more formal assessment of the public health risks associated with opioids. The FDA developed the new draft guidance with this study’s recommendations in mind. The new draft guidance we’re announcing today describes what information the FDA recommends companies provide in their opioid analgesic new drug applications in order for the agency to fully assess the benefits and risks and the public health implications of approving their product under the FDA’s current approval authorities. The agency will consider the benefits and risks of proposed new opioid analgesics relative to other already approved opioid and non-opioid analgesics. In terms of patient safety, the agency recommends that companies consider providing information on whether their drug has any characteristics that would mitigate the risks of overdose, abuse or the development of addiction. Companies should also indicate whether their drugs have novel or greater risks compared to other opioids on the market and also note the public health implications of their products in terms of risks to non-patients, including members of the patient’s household, visiting relatives, friends and others. Currently, all opioid analgesics intended for outpatient use are subject to one of the FDA-required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS programs. The draft guidance recommends that companies consider whether new products present a different safety profile than those products covered by a currently approved REMS. If so, the company should propose a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Today, the FDA is also announcing that it will hold a on September 17 to further discuss the agency’s benefit-risk assessment of opioid analgesics, including the manner in which risks of misuse and abuse of these products factor into the benefit-risk assessment. This meeting will include a discussion of whether an applicant for a new opioid analgesic should be required to demonstrate that its product has an advantage over existing drugs in order to be approved and, if so, what new authorities the FDA would need to impose such a requirement. In addition, the agency will discuss whether new preapproval incentives (in addition to existing incentives, such as breakthrough designation) are needed to better support and encourage development of all therapeutics – opioid or non-opioid drugs, biological products or devices – intended to treat pain or addiction. We also plan to issue additional guidance that will outline appropriate clinical endpoints and clinical trial approaches for the development of non-opioid drugs for use in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The FDA’s benefit-risk evaluation does not end once a product is approved; we’re continually reevaluating the safety of approved opioid products based on both post-market data the FDA has required from companies and additional sources of information as part of our safety surveillance. For example, the FDA requested the based on postmarketing data that demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation, in addition to evidence that injection of the product had been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C, as well as cases of a serious blood disorder (thrombotic microangiopathy). We’ll continue to apply this same evidence-based decision making as appropriate for other products if there is a shift in the benefits no longer outweighing the risks. Congress recently enacted new authorities that enable the FDA to, among other things, require post-market studies to evaluate efficacy of opioids and other drugs if we have concerns that these products may not be as effective as previously thought; to require opioids (and other drugs that pose a risk of abuse or overdose) be sold in unit dose packaging; and to require that such drugs be dispensed with packaging or systems that enable the drugs to be safely disposed. This guidance is part of the FDA’s implementation of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ( The FDA remains committed to addressing the opioid crisis on all fronts. The agency is focused on decreasing exposure to opioids and helping prevent new addiction by taking novel steps to encourage more appropriate prescribing; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder and promoting the development of improved, as well as lower cost, forms of medication-assisted treatment; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies that may not be as addictive as opioids, as well as opioids that are more resistant to abuse and misuse; and taking action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioid products. The FDA will also continue to evaluate how drugs currently on the market are used, in both medical and illicit settings, and will take regulatory action where needed. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "Statement on new guidance for the declaration of added sugars on food labels for single-ingredient sugars and syrups and certain cranberry products", "date": "June 18, 2019", "contents": " Three years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the most comprehensive reform to the Nutrition Facts label since its introduction in 1993. The reflect the latest nutritional science available, emphasizing the information that consumers need to make better-informed decisions about their eating habits. In updating the label, we saw a need to acknowledge that Americans are eating differently than two decades ago when the labeling requirements were first introduced, or even in 2006, when we last updated the label with added information about trans fats.  Among other changes, the new label requires that the amount of and percent Daily Value for Added Sugars be declared; the latter of which is based on 50 grams of added sugar per day, or about 12.5 teaspoons, for those consuming 2,000-calories a day. These changes take into account that Americans on average are consuming Added Sugars in amounts that exceed recommended limits. Last year, we continued this important work with the launch of the agency’s , which has as one of its hallmarks to empower consumers with information, enabling them to construct diets more consistent with the . Today we’re taking another important step with the issuance of a final guidance with the goal of helping consumers better understand the amount of sugar in single-ingredient products like powdered sugar, pure maple syrup and honey. This final guidance, “ ,” provides clarification for companies that produce single-ingredient sugars and syrups, in addition to those who produce cranberry products. Single-ingredient sugars are intended to be consumed alone or added to foods by consumers, and thus will be an added sugar to the diet when consumed. As companies who produce these products began to look at how they would implement the new label, they raised concerns about how consumers would perceive the Added Sugars declaration on their product labels. Additionally, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, commonly referred to as the “Farm Bill,” stated that Nutrition Facts labels cannot require the declaration of the gram amount of Added Sugars for single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave and syrups, including maple syrup. For maple syrup and honey especially, we heard concerns that consumers might misinterpret the Added Sugars label declaration to mean that manufacturers had added additional sugars to them, such as corn syrup or cane sugar. After reviewing and considering the comments made to our February 2018 draft guidance, as well as fulfilling the legislative requirement in the 2018 Farm Bill, we are finalizing this guidance in a way that provides consumers with information as to how consumption of these products can be accommodated within the recommendations of the dietary guidelines, while at the same time reducing the potential for consumers to misinterpret single-ingredient sugars and syrups as having additional sugars added to them. The final guidance issued today explains that for single-ingredient sugars, the Nutrition Facts label will still include a line for Total Sugars with the amount per serving expressed in grams; however, the line below it – which has been reserved for Added Sugars – will only provide a percent Daily Value for Added Sugars.  We are exercising enforcement discretion to allow for the use of a “ ” symbol immediately following the percent Daily Value declaration for Added Sugars, which leads consumers to a statement that provides information about the gram amount of Added Sugars, as well as information about how that amount of sugar contributes to the percent Daily Value. As an example, for a single-ingredient sugar that provides 10 grams of sugar per serving, manufacturers are encouraged to include a “ ” symbol after the percent Daily Value declaration for Added Sugars that refers the consumer to information that reads: ‘One serving adds 10g of sugar to your diet and represents 20% of the Daily Value for Added Sugars.’ Our goal with this final guidance is to help consumers understand that these single-ingredient sugars have no additional sugars added to them, while also conveying how their consumption will contribute to the amount of Added Sugars consumed in a day. Additionally, the final guidance provides information related to the labeling of Added Sugars on certain cranberry products. Since cranberries are naturally tart and contain very little natural sugar, the manufacturers of these products frequently add sugar to make them more palatable. The makers of these products have stated that even after adding sugar, their products typically have the equivalent total sugar content of other fruit products that do not have sugars added. Therefore, in instances where sugar is added and it does not exceed the level in a comparable fruit product, such as cranberry juice cocktail as compared to unsweetened grape juice, we are stating our intent to exercise enforcement discretion to allow the Nutrition Facts label to include a symbol that leads the consumer to a statement outside the Nutrition Facts label indicating that sugar has been added because cranberries are naturally tart. The statement can also indicate that the includes language that there is room for limited amounts of added sugars in the diet, including from nutrient-dense foods like naturally tart fruit. Alternatively, the statement could refer to the recommended limit for Added Sugars of no more than 10% of calories. Our intent with this additional information is to help American consumers more easily understand how certain sweetened cranberry products can be part of a healthy dietary pattern. In implementing this final guidance today, we have made sure to allow ample time for manufacturers to comply. Therefore, this guidance states our intent to exercise enforcement discretion so that any single-ingredient sugar or cranberry product that is impacted by this guidance will have until July 1, 2021 to switch to the new label. We want to ensure that manufacturers have time to redesign their packaging and adhere to the new labeling requirements. In updating the Nutrition Facts label and later releasing the Nutrition Innovation Strategy, the goal has been to provide consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about their diet and health, including with the products they are eating every day. Other changes that consumers are seeing on the new label include adjusted serving sizes so that the amounts of calories and nutrients listed on the label more accurately reflect what is customarily consumed. Additionally, Americans are seeing a change in which nutrients are declared, as vitamin D and potassium are now required on the label because Americans do not always get the recommended amounts. The Added Sugars declaration is one more piece of information that consumers can use to make informed decisions about their diet. Our goal in issuing this final guidance is to help consumers better understand how consumption of single-ingredient sugars and certain cranberry products can be accommodated within recommended limits for Added Sugars in healthy diets.

{"title": "Statement on a new effort to improve transparency and predictability for generic drug applicants to help increase timely access to high-quality, lower cost generic drugs", "date": "June 18, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is committed to helping facilitate American patients’ access to lower-cost generic medicines by taking steps to enhance and streamline the development and approval process of high-quality generic drugs. The U.S. already has one of the most effective and efficient generic markets in the world. Generic drugs represented 90% of U.S. prescriptions dispensed in 2017, and the FDA approved or tentatively approved more than 2,000 generic drug applications in 2017 and 2018 alone. But, there is more we may be able to do to facilitate a stable, competitive market. The agency’s previous efforts to help bolster the competitiveness of the generics market include: taking significant steps to support complex generic drug development and application review; prioritizing the review of certain generics; and publishing a . Each of these efforts were aimed at getting more competitors into the market, which might drive down prices for consumers – all the while making sure generics meet the FDA’s approval standards and will be We are working hard to reduce approval times and to enhance the efficiency of certain aspects of the submission process for generic drug applicants. We also are striving to provide the industry with greater transparency in order to provide greater certainty around timing of market entry and empower more informed decisions on how to prioritize their resources. One area we have identified to help spur investment in generic drug development is the availability of resources that may help applicants predict when their application may be able to receive final approval and when they may begin marketing their product ‒ providing patients timelier access to high-quality, lower-cost medicines. As a result, today we are enhancing one of the agency’s most viewed databases for industry, the , which provides information about exclusivity related to generic challenges of patents on “brand” drug products (180-day exclusivity). A generic applicant can seek FDA approval to market a generic drug product before the expiration of a patent for the corresponding brand drug product by providing in its application a statement asserting that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by that specific generic drug product. This statement, provided by the generic applicant as part of their Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), is called a “Paragraph IV certification.” Today, we are enhancing the by adding several additional data points, including the status of any 180-day exclusivity decisions for individual drug products, along with other information about the dates of first approval, marketing status and expiration dates of blocking patents. Providing this information may help subsequent generic drug applicants determine when their products can be approved and marketed. Before today, the list included the name of the drug product (along with the dosage form and strength) and the date on which the first substantially complete generic drug application that contained a Paragraph IV certification was submitted to the agency. Potential generic applicants may be able to infer from this information whether a generic drug application has been submitted to the FDA that might be eligible for 180-day exclusivity. With the update today, this new data may allow generic applicants to make more informed business decisions about which of their specific generic drug applications have a higher likelihood of being approved sooner. This data may also provide more public transparency into instances in which the FDA approves an ANDA with exclusivity, but the generic product is not marketed for an extended time which among other reasons may signal “gaming” tactics in the generic market. In addition, we’re sharing the number of applicants that are potentially eligible for 180-day exclusivity. This information may inform other generic manufacturers’ decisions on whether to develop a generic drug for that product. These new data fields will be included for any drug products that are the subject of ANDAs with Paragraph IV patent certifications, beginning today. Where the possibility of 180-day exclusivity for a product exists, once the exclusivity period has expired or eligibility for exclusivity has been relinquished or has been forfeited by the first generic drug applicants, other generic drugs that meet the approval requirements may then come to market. Our data shows that there are significant price decreases once there are at least three generic drugs on the market. Related, though uncommon, sometimes a generic drug manufacturer previously granted final approval for a specific product may be court ordered to cease marketing due to patent infringement. To help ensure there’s a transparent process for how we handle post-approval patent infringement court orders and convert a final approval to a tentative approval, we intend to provide clarity to industry on how we handle this process in the near future. Under our Drug Competition Action Plan, we will continue to look to provide greater clarity and transparency to generic drug applicants looking to bring their products to market. We intend to publish additional guidances and take other important policy steps to assist generic drug applicants. Drug access is a public health concern, and more generic competition could help reduce prices, improve access to needed medicines, and benefit the public health.

{"title": "Statement on agency’s efforts to increase transparency in medical device reporting ", "date": "June 21, 2019", "contents": " In the spirit of promoting public transparency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health is taking a number of important steps to update its Medical Device Reporting (MDR) Program, one of the tools the FDA uses to monitor device performance, detect potential device-related safety concerns or signals and contribute to the benefit-risk assessment of these products. First, we have formally ended the Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) Program. Under this program, manufacturers of certain devices could request an exemption from the requirement to file individual medical device reports for certain events that were well-known and well-established risks associated with a particular device and to instead submit quarterly summary reports of such events. Since the program’s inception in 1997, the FDA granted 108 such exemptions to individual manufacturers for certain well-known events associated with specific devices, which were often already described in the product labeling available to health care professionals and patients. The ASR Program allowed the FDA to more efficiently review reports of well-known, well-understood adverse events, so we could focus on identifying and taking action on new safety signals and less understood risks. To formally end the program, we’ve issued revocation letters to the remaining 13 manufacturers with ASR exemptions, which covered three kinds of devices: dental implants, implantable cardiac defibrillators and pacemaker electrodes. Today, the agency also submitted to the FDA from 1999 to 2019. While ASR reports were submitted to the FDA for review, in an effort to increase transparency, in 2017 we modified the conditions of the ASR Program to require manufacturers to also submit a “companion” medical device report so that some information collected through the ASR program would be visible publicly in our . Each companion report includes the total number of events that are being summarized for that quarter and is publicly available and searchable in MAUDE. Important details about the content and format of the ASR data being made available today are on the Since 2017, we have taken steps to gradually sunset the ASR Program and to streamline medical device reporting as we implemented the . The VMSR Program reflects a pilot program conducted in response to changes made in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and goals agreed to as part of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV) process. The FDA implemented the VMSR Program after we had conducted the pilot study that demonstrated to us the value of the program to public health. The VMSR Program enables the FDA to efficiently detect potential safety signals and free up resources to better focus on addressing the highest risks, such as deaths and serious injuries, associated with medical devices. This allows manufacturers to report certain device malfunctions in summary form on a quarterly basis, rather than on an individual basis, for eligible device types. Reports from this voluntary program are publicly available in the MAUDE database. Importantly, reports of a death or serious injury are not allowed to be submitted via the VMSR Program and the FDA may still require individual malfunction reports—instead of summary reports—for devices that are eligible for the program, such as when individual reports are necessary to address a public health issue. The FDA also intends to make MAUDE more user friendly in the next few years as part of a broader effort to modernize the medical device program’s information technology systems. Our goal is to make MDR data more usable and easier to find, furthering our efforts to increase transparency in medical device reporting. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, Congress provided funding that enabled us to begin implementation of the new systems. The President’s FY 2020 budget includes a request for additional funding for this Digital Transformation Initiative. As we are making these important changes to our medical device reporting program, it’s important to note that medical device reports submitted to the FDA are only one source we use to monitor marketed medical devices. While such reports are a valuable source of information, this type of reporting system has limitations, including the potential submission of incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, duplicative, unverified or biased data. Modernized, active surveillance that utilizes real-world data is the future of medical device safety signal detection, and is a primary focus for the FDA, as noted in our April 2018 For this reason, the FDA has worked since 2012 to develop the (NEST) – to systematically use real-world data in part to rapidly identify and help address safety signals once devices are on the market through active surveillance. Active medical device surveillance will better protect patients by, for example, continuously using analytical software algorithms to evaluate large data sets on device performance and patient safety associated with device use in routine clinical practice. In FY 2019, Congress provided funding to begin to develop active surveillance capabilities for NEST. Implementing a national surveillance system that allows the FDA to actively monitor device performance and patient safety would not be possible without the FDA’s establishment of a unique device identification (UDI) system, in which medical devices are marked on their labels with a unique code that can be used to identify the device through its distribution and use in patients. Device identifiers are stored in a , which now contains more than 2 million device records and enables patients and health care professionals to download information about their devices. The agency also has engaged in international efforts to facilitate a harmonized approach to adoption of UDI systems worldwide. Taken together, we believe these steps will improve our ability to identify and address device safety signals and provide patients and health care professionals with important information they can use to make better informed health care decisions. We look forward to providing updates in the future about our progress in this and other areas. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA expands approval of treatment for cystic fibrosis to include patients ages 6 and older", "date": "June 21, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today expanded the indication for Symdeko (a combination of tezacaftor/ivacaftor) tablets for treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have certain genetic mutations. Last year, the FDA approved Symdeko to treat patients ages 12 and older who had the same specific genetic mutations. “Decades ago, patients with cystic fibrosis were generally expected to live until 10 years of age, with few surviving into their teenage years. Since then, wide-ranging research on the disease resulted in more treatments for this debilitating disease that have extended life expectancy and improved quality of life for patients, but there is still no cure,” said Banu Karimi-Shah, M.D., acting deputy director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Based on their individual genetic makeup, individuals may respond differently to certain drugs, so it is important to provide a variety of options. Today’s approval of Symdeko for children as young as 6 years old provides an important treatment option for younger patients, and also provides more context on the safety and dosing specific to this population. The FDA remains committed to advancing novel treatment options for areas of unmet patient need, particularly in diseases impacting children.” Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene. Symdeko is used to treat patients who have two copies of the most common type of mutation – F508del mutation – or who have at least one of the mutations in the CFTR gene that is responsive to the active ingredients in Symdeko based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence.  Patients with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers should speak with a health care professional and have tests performed to understand which gene mutations patients have and whether Symdeko is likely to work for them. The efficacy of Symdeko in patients with cystic fibrosis age 12 years and older was evaluated in three Phase 3, double blind, placebo-controlled trials, which demonstrated improvements in lung function and other key measures of the disease, including a reduction in exacerbations (a worsening of symptoms requiring treatment). The efficacy in patients ages 6 to 12 was extrapolated from patients age 12 years and older, with additional support from data in patients age 6 to 12 years. The safety of Symdeko to treat cystic fibrosis patients age 6 to less than 12 years was supported by data from a study that included a 24-week, open-label treatment period with 70 cystic fibrosis patients ages 6 to less than 12, and had similar observations of safety to clinical trials in ages 12 and older. Symdeko should always be taken with food that contains fat and never in combination with certain antibiotics, seizure medicines, St. John’s wort, or food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges, as indicated on the label. The prescribing information for Symdeko includes warnings related to elevated enzymes in the liver (transaminases) in people taking Symdeko, for those who use inducers for another liver enzyme called Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A), and for the risk of cataracts in pediatric patients. Patients and their caregivers should speak with a health care professional about these risks and any medicines they take before starting Symdeko. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, sinus congestion and dizziness. The safety and efficacy of Symdeko in patients with cystic fibrosis younger than 6 years of age have not been studied. The FDA granted this application . The approval of Symdeko was granted to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women", "date": "June 21, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Vyleesi (bremelanotide) to treat acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. “There are women who, for no known reason, have reduced sexual desire that causes marked distress, and who can benefit from safe and effective pharmacologic treatment. Today’s approval provides women with another treatment option for this condition,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. “As part of the FDA’s commitment to protect and advance the health of women, we’ll continue to support the development of safe and effective treatments for female sexual dysfunction.” HSDD is characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is not due to a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, problems within the relationship or the effects of a medication or other drug substance. Acquired HSDD develops in a patient who previously experienced no problems with sexual desire. Generalized HSDD refers to HSDD that occurs regardless of the type of sexual activity, situation or partner. Vyleesi activates melanocortin receptors, but the mechanism by which it improves sexual desire and related distress is unknown. Patients inject Vyleesi under the skin of the abdomen or thigh at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity and may decide the optimal time to use Vyleesi based on how they experience the duration of benefit and any side effects, such as nausea. Patients should not use more than one dose within 24 hours or more than eight doses per month. Patients should discontinue treatment after eight weeks if they do not report an improvement in sexual desire and associated distress. The effectiveness and safety of Vyleesi were studied in two 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1,247 premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD. Most patients used Vyleesi two or three times per month and no more than once a week. In these trials, about 25% of patients treated with Vyleesi had an increase of 1.2 or more in their sexual desire score (scored on a range of 1.2 to 6.0, with higher scores indicating greater sexual desire) compared to about 17% of those who took placebo. Additionally, about 35% of the patients treated with Vyleesi had a decrease of one or more in their distress score (scored on a range of zero to four, with higher scores indicating greater distress from low sexual desire) compared to about 31% of those who took placebo. There was no difference between treatment groups in the change from the start of the study to end of the study in the number of satisfying sexual events. Vyleesi does not enhance sexual performance. The most common side effects of Vyleesi are nausea and vomiting, flushing, injection site reactions and headache. About 40% of patients in the clinical trials experienced nausea, most commonly with the first Vyleesi injection, and 13% needed medications for the treatment of nausea. About 1% of patients treated with Vyleesi in the clinical trials reported darkening of the gums and parts of the skin, including the face and breasts, which did not go away in about half the patients after stopping treatment. Patients with dark skin were more likely to develop this side effect. In the clinical trials, Vyleesi increased blood pressure after dosing, which usually resolved within 12 hours. Because of this effect, Vyleesi should not be used in patients with high blood pressure that is uncontrolled or in those with known cardiovascular disease. Vyleesi is also not recommended in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. When naltrexone is taken by mouth, Vyleesi may significantly decrease the levels of naltrexone in the blood. Patients who take a naltrexone-containing medication by mouth to treat alcohol or opioid dependence should not use Vyleesi because it could lead to naltrexone treatment failure. In 2012, the FDA identified female sexual dysfunction as one of 20 disease areas of high priority and focused attention. The FDA held a two-day meeting in October 2014 to advance the agency’s understanding of female sexual dysfunction. During the first day of the meeting, the FDA solicited about their condition and its impact on daily life. In 2016, the FDA published a draft guidance titled “ ,” to assist companies developing drugs for the treatment of these conditions. The FDA is committed to continuing to work with companies to develop safe and effective treatments for female sexual dysfunction. The FDA granted approval of Vyleesi to AMAG Pharmaceuticals.

{"title": "FDA issues warnings to companies selling illegal, unapproved kratom drug products marketed for opioid cessation, pain treatment and other medical uses ", "date": "June 25, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued to two marketers and distributors of kratom products – of Folsom, California, and of Wilmington, North Carolina – for illegally selling unapproved, misbranded kratom-containing drug products with unproven claims about their ability to treat or cure opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. The companies also make claims about treating pain, as well as other medical conditions like depression, anxiety and cancer. “We have issued numerous warnings about the serious risks associated with the use of kratom, including warnings about the contamination of kratom products with high rates of salmonella that put people using kratom products at risk, and resulted in numerous illnesses and recalls. As part of our efforts to assess kratom for contamination in the products tested, we also found high levels of heavy metals in kratom products. Despite our warnings, companies continue to sell this dangerous product and make deceptive medical claims that are not backed by science or any reliable scientific evidence,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “As we work to combat the opioid crisis, we cannot allow unscrupulous vendors to take advantage of consumers by selling products with unsubstantiated claims that they can treat opioid addiction or alleviate other medical conditions.” The FDA continues to warn consumers not to use , commonly known as kratom, a plant that grows naturally in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Kratom is not legally marketed in the United States as a drug or dietary supplement, and while it is important to gather more evidence, data suggest that certain substances in kratom have opioid properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse and dependence. There are no FDA-approved uses for kratom, and the agency has received concerning reports about the safety of kratom. The FDA is actively evaluating available scientific information on this issue and continues to warn consumers not to use any products labeled as containing the botanical substance kratom or its psychoactive compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. The FDA encourages more research to better understand kratom’s safety profile, including the use of kratom combined with other drugs. The companies receiving warning letters use websites and social media to illegally market kratom products, making unproven claims about the ability of the kratom drug products they distribute to cure, treat or prevent disease. Examples of claims being made by these companies include: Health fraud scams like these can pose serious health risks. These products have not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use and may keep some patients from seeking appropriate, FDA-approved therapies. Selling these unapproved products with claims that they can treat opioid addiction and withdrawal and other serious medical conditions is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA requested responses from both companies within 15 working days. The companies are directed to inform the agency of the specific actions taken to address each of the agency’s concerns. The warning letters also state that failure to correct violations may result in law enforcement action such as seizure or injunction. Reducing the number of Americans who are addicted to opioids and cutting the rate of new addiction is one of the FDA’s highest priorities. This work includes promoting more widespread innovation and access to opioid addiction treatments for the . The FDA is taking new steps to make safe and effective medication assisted treatments (MAT) available to those who suffer from opioid use disorder and to reduce the stigma that is sometimes associated with use of these therapies. Using products with unsubstantiated claims may prevent those addicted to opioids from seeking treatments that have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. Reliance on products with unsubstantiated claims may delay their path to recovery and put them at greater risk of addiction, overdose and death. In fact, patients receiving FDA-approved MAT cut their risk of death in half, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

{"title": "Statement on stem cell clinic permanent injunction and FDA’s ongoing efforts to protect patients from risks of unapproved products", "date": "June 25, 2019", "contents": " Today, U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro of the Southern District of Florida issued an order that stops US Stem Cell Clinic LLC, of Weston, Florida, and US Stem Cell Inc., of Sunrise, Florida, and their Chief Scientific Officer Kristin Comella, Ph.D., from manufacturing or distributing any and all stromal vascular fraction (SVF) products, which are adipose (fat) tissue derived stem cell products, until they come into compliance with the law. The U.S. Department of Justice, on FDA’s behalf, initiated this action against US Stem Cell Clinic LLC and US Stem Cell Inc., and Comella in May 2018, seeking a permanent injunction after they failed to come into compliance with the law, including FDA regulations intended to protect patients from harm. On June 3, 2019, the Court that the defendants adulterated and misbranded their cellular products made from patients’ adipose tissue. Today’s action by Judge Ungaro is significant and sends a strong message to others manufacturing violative stem cell products. Court decisions like this reaffirm the FDA’s compliance and enforcement efforts in the ongoing fight to protect the public from individuals and clinics who mislead patients with unapproved and potentially harmful medical products. The agency will continue to take steps—such as issuing warning letters or initiating court cases—against those who endanger patients’ health with inadequate manufacturing conditions or by manufacturing and marketing products without the submission of appropriate applications containing safety and efficacy information to the FDA. Patient safety is the foundation of our mission. We’re now nearly halfway through the period during which the agency for certain regenerative medicine products with respect to the FDA’s investigational new drug application (IND) and premarket approval requirements – but only for those where the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potentially significant safety concerns. The pace of progress of those offering these human cell and tissue-based products, including stem cell products, to come into compliance with the requirements has been slower than expected. We know that there are clinics across the country that manufacture or market violative stem cell products to patients, claiming that they don’t fall under the regulatory provisions for drugs and biological products. The FDA has consistently stated that this is not true, and the result of this case proves that. There are many examples of companies deceiving patients with unsubstantiated claims about the potential for stem cell products to prevent, treat or cure serious diseases, and in those cases, we are committed to acting to protect patients. These actors are taking advantage of patients, many in vulnerable positions with chronic or terminal diseases, by leveraging the widespread belief in the eventual promise of these products, flouting the statutes and our regulations. This ultimately puts at risk the very patients that they claim to want to help, by either delaying treatment with legitimate and scientifically sound treatment or, worse, posing harm to patients, such as blindness, infection or possibly death. For sponsors whose stem cell products are subject to premarket approval under the statutes and existing regulations, where the products create more significant potential risks because of the way that they’re manipulated or delivered, and who haven’t engaged the regulatory process to properly develop these products, we’ll continue our aggressive oversight, prioritizing resources to address those clinics, individuals and products that put patients most at risk. In fact, over the past year, we have sent 46 manufacturers and health care professionals regulatory correspondences, including warning letters, and one court case is ongoing. But we also recognize that there is significant interest from many stakeholders and patients interested in seeing the safe development of legitimate, novel stem cell products. We remain firmly committed to advancing an efficient path for the development of safe, effective and innovative regenerative medicine products. There are many investigators and firms legitimately developing such products, fully in keeping with our statutes and regulations, examining their safety and potential benefits in treating a range of diseases and conditions, including cancers, heart failure, stroke and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Our work to ensure compliance with the law and to protect patients does not take away from our firm commitment to advance an efficient path for the safe and effective development of novel regenerative medicine products and to help foster beneficial new innovations. We’ll continue to work closely with investigators and firms legitimately working in this field and will do so in the most effective manner possible, while meeting the FDA’s standards for safety and efficacy. Over the past year, the FDA has used a variety of tools to support such development, including providing advice through CBER’s meeting process and through use of expedited programs, such as designation, for those products that qualify, and our recently launched to also help manufacturers with informal, preliminary and non-binding assessments from the FDA regarding how specific cell and tissue-based products are regulated. Stem cell products hold significant potential to improve human health. However, that potential will never be fully realized if careful scientific work and thoughtful clinical investigation supporting the safety and efficacy of these products are not conducted. The FDA is committed to helping advance the safe and effective development of novel stem cell products. We look forward to working with those who share our goal of bringing safe and effective products to market to benefit individuals in need.

{"title": "FDA issues third status report on investigation into potential connection between certain diets and cases of canine heart disease", "date": "June 27, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is providing an update on its investigation into reports of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs eating certain types of pet food. As part of this update, the FDA is sharing a compilation of adverse event reports of DCM submitted to the agency through April 30, 2019, an updated case count, and new testing results. For the first time, the agency is also most frequently identified in these adverse event reports. It’s important to note that the FDA doesn’t yet know how certain diets may be associated with DCM in some dogs. However, the FDA is first and foremost a public health agency, and takes seriously its responsibility to protect human and animal health. In the case of DCM, the agency has an obligation to be transparent with the pet-owning public regarding the frequency with which certain brands have been reported. “We know it can be devastating to suddenly learn that your previously healthy pet has a potentially life-threatening disease like DCM. That’s why the FDA is committed to continuing our collaborative scientific investigation into the possible link between DCM and certain pet foods,” said Steven M. Solomon, D.V.M., M.P.H., director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. “Our ongoing work in this area is a top priority for the FDA, and as our investigation unfolds and we learn more about this issue, we will make additional updates to the public. In the meantime, because we have not yet determined the nature of this potential link, we continue to encourage consumers to work closely with their veterinarians, who may consult a board-certified veterinary nutritionist, to select the best diet for their pets’ needs.” Between Jan. 1, 2014, when the FDA first received a few sporadic reports, and April 30, 2019, the FDA received 524 reports of DCM (515 canine reports, 9 feline reports). The majority of the reports were submitted to the FDA after its first public alert in July 2018. Some of these reports involved more than one affected animal from the same household, so the total number of affected animals is greater than 524. In July 2018, the FDA the public about a possible link between DCM and certain pet foods, and then followed up with an in February 2019 that provided additional case counts and described ongoing investigative efforts. Over the course of the investigation, the FDA has consulted with stakeholders across the animal health community to help fill any knowledge gaps that may better inform its investigation into DCM and certain diets. , a disease of a dog’s heart muscle, can often result in congestive heart failure. The underlying cause of DCM is unknown, but is thought to have a genetic component. Breeds that are typically affected are large and giant breed dogs. However, many cases of DCM being reported to the FDA have included smaller breeds of dogs as well, suggesting a lack of a genetic connection. The FDA will continue to investigate and will provide updates to the public as information becomes available.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps", "date": "June 26, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Dupixent (dupilumab) to treat adults with nasal polyps (growths on the inner lining of the sinuses) accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis (prolonged inflammation of the sinuses and nasal cavity). This is the first treatment approved for inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusis with nasal polyps. “Nasal polyps can lead to loss of smell and often patients require surgery to remove the polyps,” said Sally Seymour, M.D., Director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Dupixent provides an important treatment option for patients whose nasal polyps are not adequately controlled with intranasal steroids. It also reduces the need for nasal polyp surgery and oral steroids.” Dupixent is given by injection. The efficacy and safety of Dupixent were established in two studies with 724 patients, 18 years and older with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who were symptomatic despite taking intranasal corticosteroids. Patients who received Dupixent had statistically significant reductions in their nasal polyp size and nasal congestion compared to the placebo group. Patients taking Dupixent also reported an increased ability to smell and required less nasal polyp surgery and oral steroids. Dupixent may cause serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis). If patients experience new or worsening eye symptoms, such as redness, itching, pain or visual changes, they should consult their health care professional. The most common side effects reported include injection site reactions as well as eye and eyelid inflammation, which included redness, swelling and itching. Patients receiving Dupixent should avoid receiving live vaccines. Dupixent was originally approved in 2017 for patients 12 and older with eczema that is not controlled adequately by topical therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. In 2018, Dupixent was approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system ", "date": "June 27, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Soliris (eculizumab) injection for intravenous use for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. NMOSD is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. “Soliris provides the first FDA-approved treatment for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a debilitating disease that profoundly impacts patients’ lives,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This approval changes the landscape of therapy for patients with NMOSD. Having an approved therapy for this condition is the culmination of extensive work we have engaged in with drug companies to expedite the development and approval of safe and effective treatments for patients with NMOSD, and we remain committed to these efforts for other rare diseases.” In patients with NMOSD, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and proteins in the body, most often in the optic nerves and spinal cord. Individuals with NMOSD typically have attacks of optic neuritis, which causes eye pain and vision loss. Individuals also can have attacks resulting in transverse myelitis, which often causes numbness, weakness, or paralysis of the arms and legs, along with loss of bladder and bowel control. Most attacks occur in clusters, days to months to years apart, followed by partial recovery during periods of remission. Approximately 50% of patients with NMOSD have permanent visual impairment and paralysis caused by NMOSD attacks. According to the National Institutes of Health, women are more often affected by NMOSD than men and African Americans are at greater risk of the disease than Caucasians. Estimates vary, but NMOSD is thought to impact approximately 4,000 to 8,000 patients in the United States. NMOSD can be associated with antibodies that bind to a protein called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Binding of the anti-AQP4 antibody appears to activate other components of the immune system, causing inflammation and damage to the central nervous system. The effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of NMOSD was demonstrated in a clinical study of 143 patients with NMOSD who had antibodies against AQP4 (anti-AQP4 positive) who were randomized to receive either Soliris treatment or placebo. Compared to treatment with placebo, the study showed that treatment with Soliris reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 94 percent over the 48-week course of the trial. Soliris also reduced the need for hospitalizations and the need for treatment of acute attacks with corticosteroids and plasma exchange. Soliris has a boxed warning to alert health care professionals and patients that life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with Soliris, and that such infections may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluated immediately if infection is suspected. Use should be discontinued in patients who are being treated for serious meningococcal infections. Health care professionals should use caution when administering Soliris to patients with any other infection. In the NMOSD clinical trial, no cases of meningococcal infection were observed. Soliris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Prescribers must enroll in the REMS program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine(s). The drug must be dispensed with the FDA-approved patient Medication Guide that provides important information about the drug’s uses and risks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions reported by patients in the NMOSD clinical trial were: upper respiratory infection, common cold (nasopharyngitis), diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, influenza, joint pain (arthralgia), sore throat (pharyngitis) and contusion. The FDA granted the approval of Soliris to Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Soliris was first approved by the FDA in 2007. The drug is approved to reduce destruction of red blood cells in adults with a rare blood disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, for the treatment of adults and children with a rare disease that causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys (atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy), and for the treatment of adults with Myasthenia Gravis who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive.

{"title": "FDA warns patients and health care providers about potential cybersecurity concerns with certain Medtronic insulin pumps ", "date": "June 27, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is patients and health care providers that certain Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps are being recalled due to potential cybersecurity risks and recommends that patients using these models switch their insulin pump to models that are better equipped to protect against these potential risks. To date, the FDA is not aware of any confirmed reports of patient harm related to these potential cybersecurity risks. The potential risks are related to the wireless communication between Medtronic's MiniMed insulin pumps and other devices such as blood glucose meters, continuous glucose monitoring systems, the remote controller and CareLink USB device used with these pumps. The FDA is concerned that, due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified in the device, someone other than a patient, caregiver or health care provider could potentially connect wirelessly to a nearby MiniMed insulin pump and change the pump’s settings. This could allow a person to over deliver insulin to a patient, leading to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), or to stop insulin delivery, leading to high blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis (a buildup of acids in the blood). “The FDA urges manufacturers everywhere to remain vigilant about their medical products—to monitor and assess cybersecurity vulnerability risk, and to be proactive about disclosing vulnerabilities and mitigations to address them. This is part of the FDA’s overall effort to collaborate with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device’s total product lifecycle,” said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation and acting division director for All Hazards Response, Science and Strategic Partnerships in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “While we are not aware of patients who may have been harmed by this particular cybersecurity vulnerability, the risk of patient harm if such a vulnerability were left unaddressed is significant. The safety communication issued today contains recommendations for what actions patients and health care providers should take to avoid the risk this vulnerability could pose. Any medical device connected to a communications network, like Wi-Fi, or public or home Internet, may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could be exploited by unauthorized users. However, at the same time it’s important to remember that the increased use of wireless technology and software in medical devices can also offer safer, more convenient, and timely health care delivery.” The recalled pumps are Medtronic’s MiniMed 508 insulin pump and MiniMed Paradigm series insulin pumps. Medtronic is providing alternative insulin pumps to patients with enhanced built-in cybersecurity capabilities. In the U.S., Medtronic has identified 4,000 patients who are potentially using insulin pumps that are vulnerable to this issue. In addition, Medtronic is working with distributor partners to identify additional patients potentially using these pumps. Insulin pumps are small computerized devices that deliver insulin to a patient throughout the day through a catheter (a small, flexible tube) implanted under the skin. They are often used instead of periodic insulin injections. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may need an insulin pump when they require insulin to maintain acceptable blood glucose levels. The affected devices wirelessly connect to both the patients’ blood glucose meter—which measures a patient’s blood glucose levels at one point in time—and continuous glucose monitoring system—a sensor and transmitter that track a patient’s glucose levels throughout the day. The remote controller and CareLink USB, a thumb-sized wireless device that plugs into a computer, are used with the affected insulin pumps. A patient can use the remote controller to send insulin bolus (dosing) commands to the insulin pump remotely and can use the CareLink USB to download data about their glucose levels from their insulin pump to monitor their own progress and share it with their health care provider. Medtronic is unable to adequately update the MiniMed 508 and Paradigm insulin pumps with any software or patch to address the devices’ vulnerabilities. The FDA is working to assure that Medtronic addresses this cybersecurity issue, including helping patients with affected insulin pumps switch to newer models with better cybersecurity controls. The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

{"title": "FDA warns repackers distributing pharmaceutical ingredients, including opioids, for putting consumers at risk with significant violations of manufacturing quality standards", "date": "July 02, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to three repackers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), B&B Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Asclemed USA, Inc., doing business as Enovachem and Spectrum Laboratory Products, Inc., for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. “Repackers play a role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, and some distribute bulk API to drug manufacturers and pharmacy compounders. The U.S. drug supply chain remains one of the safest in the world, yet because of the various players and increased globalization, it has become increasingly complex. The FDA remains vigilant in our inspections and oversight of the supply chain and as part of this effort, we inspect API repackers to help identify and prevent any weaknesses in the legitimate supply chain – this is especially important within the context of the opioid crisis for those who handle opioids,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The supply chain issues we have found in the API repacking industry broadly pose a real threat to the public health and we’re calling on them to address these issues as quickly as possible. For patient safety and supply chain transparency, repackers must follow all quality standards pertaining to them – including clearly identifying the original manufacturer of the drugs, such as opioids, to their customers who use them to make the finished drugs patients take every day. This information is vitally important to ensure the drugs patients take meet high quality standards that patients deserve.” Generally, API repackers take bulk API (usually in powder form) from the container in which it was distributed by the original manufacturer and place it into a different container without further manipulation of the drug and distribute it to drug manufacturers, compounding pharmacies or outsourcing facilities. Improper repackaging or lack of supply chain oversight of API can cause serious vulnerabilities in the supply chain and may lead to adverse events in patients. The warning letter issued to describes failures to conform to CGMPs, including failure to thoroughly investigate complaints regarding sub-potent API. The repacker also failed to conduct cleaning validation studies to demonstrate that their cleaning procedures for non-dedicated production equipment are adequate to prevent potential cross-contamination between repackaged API, including highly potent drugs such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen and opioids. The repacker also failed to provide adequate certificates of analysis for API, by not including critical information about the quality and sourcing of drugs and their components. Omitting this vital information from a certificate of analysis compromises supply chain accountability and traceability and may put consumers at risk. The warning letter issued to notes, among other violations, failure to maintain traceability of the API throughout the supply chain, specifically warning that the company failed to obtain and retain documents with the identity of the original manufacturer and certificates of analysis from the original manufacturer. The company also distributed API, including opioids, to its customers with incomplete certificates of analysis, which compromises supply chain accountability and traceability and may put consumers at risk. The customers included compounding pharmacies which use the API for prescription compounding. The FDA issued a warning letter to for significant deviations from CGMPs. Spectrum repackages various opioid APIs but did not provide complete information in its certificates of analysis provided to its customers, including compounding pharmacies. Spectrum failed to properly investigate and resolve critical CGMP deviations, including cracked bottles of repackaged opioids, among other violations. The Spectrum and Enovachem warning letters also state these companies list glycerin among the products they repackage. In 2007, the FDA issued final guidance intended to alert pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy compounders, repackers, and suppliers to the potential public health hazard of contaminated with diethylene glycol (DEG), a poison which may be deadly to patients. Lapses in supply chain oversight, including incomplete information on certificates of analysis, was one of the factors that allowed contaminated drugs to enter the supply chain in the past. The FDA has requested responses from each repacker within 15 working days. The warning letters also state that failure to correct violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. Additionally, the FDA has issued separate warning letters to other API repackers for similar violations, including , and added Lumis Global Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. and Sal Pharma to import alerts, including 66-40 for failure to meeting CGMPs, to keep their API from ultimately reaching U.S. patients. The agency has also issued alerts about safety issues with repackaged The FDA will continue to inspect and take action as appropriate against repackers, particularly those in the opioid API supply chain.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for refractory multiple myeloma", "date": "July 03, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Xpovio (selinexor) tablets in combination with the corticosteroid dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is resistant to several other forms of treatment, including at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. “While there is no cure for multiple myeloma, there are FDA-approved treatments to target the cancer and slow down the spread of the disease. Sadly, often over time, patients can exhaust all available treatments and still see their disease progress,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today we approved a treatment under our accelerated approval program that provides a treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma with no available therapy.” Multiple myeloma is cancer that begins in plasma cells (white blood cells that produce antibodies) and may also be referred to as plasma cell myeloma. Abnormal plasma cells build up in the bone marrow, forming tumors in many bones of the body. As more antibodies are made, it can cause blood to thicken and keep the bone marrow from making enough healthy blood cells. The exact causes of multiple myeloma are unknown, but it is more common in older people and African Americans. Efficacy was evaluated in 83 patients with RRMM who were treated with Xpovio in combination with dexamethasone. At the end of the study, the overall response rate was measured at 25.3%. The median time to first response was four weeks, with a range of one to ten weeks. The median duration of response was 3.8 months. The efficacy evaluation was supported by additional information from an ongoing, randomized trial in patients with multiple myeloma. Common side effects of patients taking Xpovio in combination with dexamethasone include a low white blood cell count (leukopenia), a low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell (neutropenia), low count of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and low amount of red blood cells (anemia). Patients also reported vomiting, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, fever, decreased appetite and weight, constipation, upper respiratory tract infections and low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia). Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients for low blood counts, platelets and sodium levels. Patients should avoid taking Xpovio with other medications that may cause dizziness or confusion and avoid situations where dizziness may be a problem. Health care professionals are advised to optimize the patient’s hydration status, blood counts and other medications to avoid dizziness or confusion. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Xpovio. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Xpovio because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Xpovio must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Xpovio in combination with dexamethasone was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on an endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to verify and describe Xpovio’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designation. Xpovio also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Xpovio to Karyopharm Therapeutics.

{"title": "Statement on steps to make health care professional and patient labeling information for prescription medications consistent and clear", "date": "July 01, 2019", "contents": " The FDA is committed to making sure that health care professionals and patients have up-to-date, accurate and actionable information about prescription medications so that informed treatment decisions can be made. We recognize that the choice of which medication to use, if any, for a particular patient is often a complex decision. These decisions involve a number of factors, such as assessing the progression of the disease or condition; looking at the other medications being taken; evaluating the ability of the patient to follow treatment regimens and instructions to help ensure safe use of a medication; and sometimes, assessing the risk of abuse and dependence of a medication for a particular patient. As such, we continually work to help ensure that FDA-approved medication and biological product labeling (often referred to as the “package insert” or Prescribing Information) provides clear, complete information so that health care professionals have the essential information needed to make informed decisions and to facilitate safe and effective use of a medication. One area of patient counseling that is incredibly important within a discussion about a product’s benefits and risks is the potential for abuse and the development of a physical dependence to a prescription drug. This is relevant in the context of prescription opioids for treating pain, but it’s important for patients to understand that other drugs can be habit-forming as well – for example, certain medications used to treat insomnia and some medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We’ve taken many steps to ensure that patients and health care professionals have clear information on a drug’s abuse and dependence potential, so they can make informed treatment decisions. This is one of the key factors in our evaluation of a drug’s benefits and risks when we’re considering approval and remains part of our ongoing monitoring once a drug is approved. In fact, we’ve taken steps when evidence makes the FDA concerned that the abuse of a drug may result in its benefits no longer outweighing its risks – like when the agency requested removal of the prescription opioid, , based on postmarketing data that demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation, in addition to evidence that injection of the product had been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C, as well as cases of a serious blood disorder (thrombotic microangiopathy). Today, we’re taking another step in this area and announcing new draft guidance, . The recommendations in this draft guidance, when finalized, will represent our current thinking on the content and format of this section for prescription medications that are scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as well as for prescription medications not scheduled under the CSA for which there is important information to convey to health care professionals related to abuse and dependence. Our goal is that this guidance will help ensure that information in product labeling on abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence and tolerance is clear, concise, useful and informative. Details about a product’s abuse-deterrent properties should also be presented in this section, when applicable. Additionally, the draft guidance provides recommendations on how to present information about applicable drug products in a consistent manner where possible within, and across, drug and therapeutic classes to inform decisions and facilitate the safe and effective use of medications. This draft guidance reinforces these principles by recommending, for example, that terminology used in the Drug Abuse and Dependence section – such as abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence and tolerance – be defined in labeling to ensure common understanding. Because these terms are commonly confused or misinterpreted, the FDA has included recommended definitions for the purposes of labeling. The draft guidance clarifies, for example, that a person who takes a friend’s prescription opioid medication to relieve tooth pain is misusing the medication; if that person takes a friend’s opioid to get a euphoric high, that use represents abuse of the medication. In another example of our work specific to opioid medication labeling and dependence, recently the FDA announced for all opioid analgesics to provide additional information to health care professionals on how to safely decrease the treatment dose in patients who are physically dependent on opioids. The FDA remains focused on striking the right balance between reducing the rate of opioid use disorder by decreasing excessive exposure to opioids through rational prescribing, while still enabling appropriate access to treatment for patients living with pain. We are also committed to making sure that patients who use opioids take them correctly, and, if opioid treatment is no longer needed, that patients and their health care providers know how to discontinue the medication safely. We’re also issuing a second draft guidance today, , which relates to how the drug or biologic is used. The Instructions for Use (IFU) is a type of labeling for patients who use products that have complicated or detailed patient-use instructions. Importantly, an IFU provides detailed, action-oriented, step-by-step written and visual instructions in a patient-friendly manner to guide the patient on how to use a prescription medication product. It typically includes instructions on preparation, administration, handling, storage and disposal. The recommendations in this draft guidance are intended to promote development of consistent content and format across IFUs to help ensure that patients receive clear, concise information that is easily understood to facilitate the safe and effective use of such products. Additionally, as part of our ongoing efforts in labeling development, the FDA recently issued other draft guidances that provide clarity and recommendations on how best to draft specific sections of labeling. For example, we issued a draft guidance to assist applicants in developing the of product labeling for products approved under the accelerated approval pathway. We also issued a final guidance to assist applicants in determining the appropriate placement and content of to help ensure that information on use of prescription medications in pediatric populations - whether positive, negative or inconclusive - is consistently written and appropriately placed in labeling so that the information is clear and accessible. These actions aim to enhance the safe and effective use of prescription medication and biological products to optimize patient care and keep Americans healthy. We hope the two draft guidances being announced today will assist companies in creating labeling that is clear, concise, useful and informative, and, to the extent possible, consistent in content and format within and across drug and therapeutic classes. We encourage the public to comment on these draft guidances and will consider all comments as the agency works to finalize them.

These new actions are part of the FDA’s ongoing, aggressive effort to investigate and take action against illegally marketed tobacco products amid the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use in America. “Today’s actions make clear that we will continue to keep a close watch on whether companies are breaking the law and will take swift steps when violations are found. Our work in this area has already resulted in a number of companies removing products from the market,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The marketing of illegal tobacco products is particularly concerning given the epidemic of youth vaping that we’re facing, which we know has resulted in part from irresponsible practices of manufacturers, importers and retailers who have targeted kids in their marketing of these products. We are committed to tackling the troubling trend of youth e-cigarette use by continuing to use all available regulatory tools to ensure these products aren’t being marketed to, sold to, or used by kids. It is critical that we remain vigilant in our efforts to stem the increase in use and nicotine addiction in children driven by e-cigarettes, which threatens to erase the years of progress we’ve made combatting tobacco use among kids.” The products subject to the warning letters were introduced or modified after Aug. 8, 2016 – the effective date of the final rule that extended the FDA’s authority to all tobacco products. Any new tobacco product that does not meet the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act’s (FD&C Act) premarket requirements is adulterated and/or misbranded and may not be legally marketed without authorization from the FDA. The agency has several tools to enforce the requirements of the FD&C Act and regulations, including pursuing administrative actions such as civil money penalty complaints (fines) or judicial actions such as seizures or injunctions. The companies receiving warning letters from the agency for illegally selling their products without required marketing authorization are: The FDA has requested responses from each of the four companies within 15 working days on how they intend to address the agency’s concerns, including the dates on which they discontinued any violative sale and/or distribution of these tobacco products, and their plans for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. Failure to correct violations may result in further action such as seizure or injunction. In addition, misbranded or adulterated products imported into the U.S. are subject to detention and refusal of admission. As part of the agency’s , the FDA continues work on all fronts to keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of America’s kids through policies that limit youth access to, and appeal of, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. The FDA does this by taking actions to hold manufacturers and retailers accountable when they illegally market or sell these products to minors, and by educating the public to warn youth about the dangers of using all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The agency has previously seeking information about more than 130 Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) products, including evidence that the product is legally marketed. As a result, a number of companies have removed products from the market.

{"title": "Statement on data accuracy issues with recently approved gene therapy", "date": "August 06, 2019", "contents": " As a public health agency, we believe that it is critical to facilitate the development of innovative safe and effective medical products, like the cellular and gene therapy products that have shown enormous potential to treat previously untreatable diseases. As part of the approval process for biological products, the agency reviews extensive information submitted by manufacturers, including details of how the product is made in a reproducible manner, how it has been tested in animals, and how it has been investigated in human clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to submit complete and accurate information in marketing applications for evaluation by the FDA. If we become aware of a concern with data submitted to the agency as part of our review of a product application, it is in the best interest of patients, their caregivers, and the public that we disclose such information, to the extent permitted by law. On May 24, the , a gene therapy product intended to treat children less than two years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 gene — the most severe form of SMA. SMA is a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Subsequently, on June 28, following the FDA’s approval of the product, the agency was informed by AveXis Inc., the product’s manufacturer, about a data manipulation issue that impacts the accuracy of certain data from product testing performed in animals submitted in the biologics license application (BLA) and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA is carefully this situation and remains confident that Zolgensma should remain on the market. Out of the large amount of submitted information reviewed by the agency, our concerns at this time are limited to only a small portion of the product testing data that was contained in the marketing application. This product testing data was used by the manufacturer to support the development of its production process for the product. These data do not change the agency’s positive assessment of the information from the human clinical trials that were conducted as part of the development program. The totality of the evidence demonstrating the product’s effectiveness and its safety profile continues to provide compelling evidence supporting an overall favorable benefit-risk profile. However, the integrity of the product testing data used in the development of the product’s manufacturing process is still a matter that we are continuing to evaluate and take very seriously. Ensuring truthful, complete and accurate data in product applications is a critical component of industry’s responsibility as they work to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of biological products. The submission of such truthful, complete and accurate data is also critical for the FDA to be able to protect the public health, and the law requires it. We are carefully assessing the issue of the manipulation of the product testing data used in the production process and are conducting a thorough assessment of the information from a recently .  In part, this will allow us to determine the implications for the FDA’s scientific review of the information in the BLA and will allow us to amend our publicly posted BLA reviews, as appropriate. We are also aware that AveXis became aware of the issue of the data manipulation that created inaccuracies in their BLA before the FDA approved the product, yet did not inform the FDA until after the product was approved. The agency will use its full authorities to take action, if appropriate, which may include civil or criminal penalties. We recognize that parents of, and health care professionals for, children with SMA may have questions or concerns about this information. Parents and health care professionals may contact the FDA at (800) 835-4709 or AveXis for more information. The FDA will continue to provide updates related to this statement as we learn more. As with all biological products, health care professionals and patients (or for Zolgensma, their caregivers) should be aware of both the product’s benefits and risks. The most common side effects of Zolgensma are elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Zolgensma has a boxed warning that acute serious liver injury can occur. Health care professionals and caregivers should refer to the product package insert for additional risk information.

{"title": "FDA statement on court ruling related to compounded bulk drug substances and the agency’s ongoing efforts to implement its compounding authorities", "date": "August 06, 2019", "contents": " Late last week, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C. issued a decision that upheld FDA’s interpretation of clinical need regarding the bulk substances that may be used by outsourcing facilities in drug compounding. We are pleased with the court’s decision, which is a victory for public health in the first such case since the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) was enacted. that vasopressin is not a “bulk drug substance for which there is a clinical need” because there is already a product on the market that is FDA-approved to meet patients’ medical needs. The agency, therefore, decided not to place the bulk drug substance vasopressin on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding by outsourcing facilities (the “503B Bulks List”). Last week, the court agreed, finding that the agency’s method of determining whether there is a “clinical need” for a bulk drug substance is consistent with the law. We will continue to evaluate bulk drug substances nominated for use in compounding by outsourcing facilities in accordance with our interpretation of clinical need. Our compounding work remains a top priority at the agency. We’ve long recognized that compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product. But compounded drugs are not approved by the FDA and, therefore, have not been evaluated for safety, efficacy or quality. We’ve seen first-hand the harm they can cause patients when they’re not appropriately compounded. FDA oversight of compounding continues to remain essential, because compounded drugs, while important to patients who need them, pose ongoing and serious risks if they are not manufactured properly. Every year, the FDA learns of cases of patient illnesses and deaths due to improperly compounded drugs and caused by issues like contamination in drugs that need to be sterile because they are entering the bloodstream, the eye, or the spine or because the drugs are not made at the right strength and are super-potent. Since the enactment of the DQSA, we’ve taken significant new steps to modernize and clarify our policies related to the quality of compounding in an effort to ensure continued access to compounded drugs for patients who need them, while also protecting patients from the risks of contaminated or otherwise harmful products. For example, we’re facilitating on bulk drug substances with the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and through the FDA's Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. These efforts will help us further advance the development of the bulks list. We’ve also held meetings discussing current good manufacturing practice for outsourcing facilities. Later this year, we plan to finalize our between FDA and the states to ensure coordinated safety actions and maximize our joint resources. We also continue to take action when we observe significant violations of law. While some compounders work hard to meet quality standards including avoiding insanitary conditions, we recognize that there are still compounders that are not in compliance. To address these risks, a key component of our work continues to include our risk-based inspections and pursuing other enforcement efforts to identify compounders who produce drugs under substandard conditions or use inappropriate practices that could lead to serious harm. Since 2018, the FDA has sent warning letters to 40 facilities for adulterated product violations. These include insanitary conditions. We also worked with compounders on over 90 recalls of products from the marketplace that raised safety concerns. Since 2018, FDA has entered into six consent decrees of permanent injunction to address the risk of patient harm from exposure to unsafe compounded drugs. We look forward to continuing to advance a robust compounding policy framework as part of our commitment to fulfilling our vital consumer protection role.

Since 2010, the FDA consumers about the dangers of Miracle or Master Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, MMS, Chlorine Dioxide (CD) Protocol, Water Purification Solution (WPS) and other similar products. Miracle Mineral Solution has not been approved by the FDA for any use, but these products continue to be promoted on social media as a remedy for treating autism, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and flu, among other conditions. However, the solution, when mixed, develops into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. “The FDA’s drug approval process ensures that patients receive safe and effective drug products. Miracle Mineral Solution and similar products are not FDA-approved, and ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach. Consumers should not use these products, and parents should not give these products to their children for any reason,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “The FDA will continue to track those selling this dangerous product and take appropriate enforcement actions against those who attempt to evade FDA regulations and market unapproved and potentially dangerous products to the American public. Our top priority is to protect the public from products that place their health at risk, and we will send a strong and clear message that these products have the potential to cause serious harm.” Websites selling MMS describe the product as a liquid that is 28% sodium chlorite in distilled water. Product directions instruct consumers to mix the sodium chlorite solution with citric acid – such as lemon or lime juice – or another acid before drinking. In many instances, the sodium chlorite is sold with a citric acid “activator.” When the acid is added, the mixture becomes chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent. The FDA recently received new reports of people experiencing severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure after drinking these products. The FDA is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting the safety or effectiveness of MMS products, despite claims that the solution is an antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial. The FDA encourages consumers to talk to a health care professional about treating medical conditions or diseases. Consumers who have experienced an adverse health effect after ingesting this product should seek immediate medical attention. Anyone who has experienced an adverse health effect that may be related to MMS should report it through the FDA’s as soon as possible at 800-FDA-1088 or The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA sends warning to company for selling unapproved umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord products that may put patients at risk; continues to warn patients of the risk of unapproved stem cell therapy", "date": "September 03, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has Stemell, Inc. (Stemell), of San Juan Capistrano, California, and its president and Chief Executive Officer, Peyman Taeidi, Ph.D., for manufacturing and distributing unapproved products derived from umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord and for significant deviations from current good tissue practice (CGTP) and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, including deficient donor eligibility practices and environmental monitoring, creating potential significant safety concerns that put patients at risk. Stemell’s unapproved products derived from umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord are StemL UCB-Plus and StemL UCT-Plus. “We know that there are manufacturers and clinics across the country that manufacture or market violative stem cell products to patients, claiming that they don't fall under the regulatory provisions for drugs and biological products. The FDA has consistently stated that this is not true,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “This company failed to take appropriate measures to protect patient safety. The FDA will be increasing our oversight related to cell-based regenerative medicine as part of our comprehensive plan to promote beneficial innovation while protecting patients. Those who are manufacturing or marketing unapproved, potentially unsafe products must understand that there’s a clear line between appropriate development of these products and those practices that sidestep important statutory and regulatory controls that are in place to protect patients.” The FDA’s recent inspection of the Stemell facility in March revealed that the company was manufacturing products derived from human umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord for use in recipients unrelated to the donors of the products. Because these Stemell products are not intended for homologous use only (i.e., to perform the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor) and fail to meet other criteria set forth in applicable FDA regulations, they are regulated as both drugs and biological products. To lawfully market these products, an approved biologics license application is needed. While in the development stage, the products may be used in humans only if an investigational new drug application (IND) is in effect. However, no such licenses or INDs exist for these Stemell products. During the inspection, the FDA documented evidence of significant deviations from CGTP and CGMP requirements in the manufacture of Stemell’s products, including deficient donor eligibility practices, unvalidated manufacturing processes, deficient environmental monitoring and inadequate aseptic processes. These deviations pose a risk that the products may be contaminated with viruses or microorganisms or have other serious product quality defects. “The FDA remains highly committed to facilitating the development and availability of safe and effective cellular therapy products. However, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect people from being harmed by products with potential significant safety concerns,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “In addition to the warning letter issued today, we sent another 20 letters to manufacturers and health care providers across the country who may be offering unapproved stem cell products, reiterating the FDA’s compliance and enforcement policy. We remain very concerned that countless clinics across the country continue to market violative stem cell products to patients that have not been appropriately evaluated for safety or efficacy.” As highlighted in 2017 with the release of the FDA’s , including the FDA’s final guidance ( ), the FDA intends to apply a risk-based approach to compliance and enforcement of cell-based regenerative medicine products, taking into account how products are being administered as well as the diseases and conditions for which they are intended to be used. The agency noted that it intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain products until November 2020 with respect to FDA’s investigational new drug application and premarket approval requirements when the use of the product does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns. However, the FDA does not intend to exercise such enforcement discretion for those products that pose a potential significant safety concern to patients. As reflected by this warning letter, the other letters issued today, and other correspondence issued recently, the FDA will take appropriate steps to protect the public health. The FDA offers opportunities for engagement between potential manufacturers and the agency, such as through the program, to facilitate product development. It also encourages the use of its expedited programs whenever applicable, in addition to the collaborative development of products as the former FDA Commissioner and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research director discussed in a perspective. In addition, the a temporary program called the Tissue Reference Group (TRG) Rapid Inquiry Program (TRIP), which is intended to assist manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (including stem cells) to obtain a rapid, preliminary, informal, non-binding assessment from the agency regarding how their specific products are regulated. The FDA requested a response from Stemell, within 15 working days of the letter’s issuance, that details how the deviations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Deviations not corrected by companies and owners could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction or prosecution.

{"title": "Statement on federal and state collaboration to investigate respiratory illnesses reported after use of e-cigarette products", "date": "August 30, 2019", "contents": " Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working tirelessly to investigate the distressing incidents of severe respiratory disease associated with use of e-cigarette products. We were deeply saddened last week to learn of the death of an adult in Illinois who had been hospitalized with a severe respiratory illness following the use of an e-cigarette product. We are working closely with state and local health officials to investigate these incidents as quickly as possible, and we are committed to taking appropriate actions as a clearer picture of the facts emerges. We’ve also made it a top priority to communicate with the public about our efforts. Today, we are providing several updates about efforts between FDA, CDC and state health officials to investigate these incidents that have impacted both youth and adults across the country. First, we are updating the number of potential cases of respiratory illnesses reported after use of e-cigarette products. Additionally, we are sharing more details about the work CDC and FDA are undertaking as part of the investigation, including its current status. We are also providing the public and our health partners across the country with information to help mitigate the risk of additional incidents and what health officials and clinicians can do to help us gather as much data as possible to better understand these illness and potential causes. As of Aug. 27, 2019, 215 possible cases have been reported from 25 states, and additional reports of pulmonary illness are under investigation. States are completing their own investigations and verifications of cases based on CDC’s recently released standardized case definition. While some cases in each of the states are similar and appear to be linked to e-cigarette product use, more information is needed to determine what is causing the respiratory illnesses. In many cases, patients reported a gradual start of symptoms, including breathing difficulty, shortness of breath, and/or chest pain before hospitalization. Some cases reported mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness including vomiting and diarrhea, or other symptoms such as fevers or fatigue. In many cases, patients have also acknowledged recent use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette products while speaking to healthcare personnel, or in follow-up interviews by health department staff. Even though cases appear similar, it is not clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations, which is why our ongoing investigation is critical. CDC and the FDA are providing consultation to state health departments and working closely with them to gather information on any products or substances used. For example, our agencies are working to standardize information collection at the state level to help build a more comprehensive picture of these incidents. This includes investigating the brand and types of e-cigarette products, whether any of them are products that would fall within the FDA’s regulatory authority, as well as where they were obtained. CDC is helping involved states investigate whether the illnesses may be linked to specific devices, ingredients or contaminants in the devices, or substances associated with e-cigarette product use, with the FDA’s assistance. Current assistance to states includes deploying CDC staff to Illinois and Wisconsin to assist their state health departments with the respective state investigations; releasing a describing this investigation and asking providers to report possible cases to their state health departments; developing and distributing to involved states a standardized case definition, medical chart abstraction form, and case interview questionnaire with input from states who are running investigations; reviewing and providing feedback on data collection and health messaging tools for states; and facilitating information sharing between states with possible cases. In addition to daily meetings between our federal agencies, as well as frequent communication with state health officials, the FDA has been and will continue to provide laboratory assistance. The FDA has received about 80 samples and continues to receive requests from states to send more samples for the FDA to analyze. The samples represent a variety of different types of products and substances – a number of which contained incomplete information about the product. The FDA is analyzing those samples for their contents, whether they contain nicotine, substances, such as THC or other cannabinoids, or other chemicals and ingredients. The results of that testing will be shared with the respective states to aid in their investigations and will help inform the federal response. More information is needed to better understand whether there’s a relationship between any specific products or substances and the reported illnesses. At this time, there does not appear to be one product involved in all of the cases, although THC and cannabinoids use has been reported in many cases. At this time, the specific substances within the e-cigarette products that cause illness are not known and could involve a variety of substances. We continue to gather information about the names of the products used, where they were purchased, and how the products were used. That information is critical to help determine whether patterns emerge on which we can take additional action. While we continue to gather more information about these incidents and any specific products or substances involved, we also believe it’s important to provide the public with useful information to help protect themselves and their loved ones, as well as continue to notify health care professionals about the illnesses, what to watch for, and how to collect and report information on these cases. As part of that commitment, CDC today issued a . The advisory includes the recommendation that while this investigation is ongoing, if you are concerned about these specific health risks, consider refraining from the use of e-cigarette products. Anyone who does use e-cigarette products should not buy these products off the street (e.g., e-cigarette products with THC or other cannabinoids) and should not modify e-cigarette products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Regardless of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette products should not be used by youth, young adults, pregnant women, and adults who do not currently use tobacco products. If you use e-cigarette products, monitor yourself for symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breaths, chest pain) and promptly seek medical attention if you have concerns about your health. CDC and the FDA will continue to advise and alert the public as more information becomes available. Adult smokers who are attempting to quit should use evidence-based treatments, including counseling and FDA-approved medications. If you need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, contact your doctor. If you are concerned about harmful effects from e-cigarette products, call your local poison control center at: 1-800-222-1222. We also continue to encourage the public to submit detailed reports of any unexpected tobacco- or e-cigarette-related health or product issues to the FDA via the online As this investigation continues, our agencies remain committed to working as quickly as possible, in collaboration with our state and local public health partners and the clinical community, to find out as much as we can about these cases and potential causes and communicating with the public about these efforts to protect and promote the public health. Our ongoing oversight and educational efforts related to e-cigarettes is critical to our public health mission and, especially, to protecting youth from the dangers of nicotine addiction and tobacco-related disease and death.

According to the complaint filed with the consent decree, the defendants unlawfully distributed unapproved new drugs, adulterated and misbranded dietary supplements and an adulterated and misbranded device. “Americans expect and deserve products that meet appropriate standards for quality. To ensure safe use by consumers, it’s important that companies who sell products adhere to standards set forth by the FD&C Act, including product labeling and quality,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Despite previous warnings, Basic Reset and Biogenyx placed consumers at risk by distributing certain products in violation of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements and products which failed to adequately meet labeling standards. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration remains fully committed to taking enforcement action against companies and owners who place unsuspecting American consumers at risk.” The FDA has not approved Basic Reset’s or Biogenyx’s drugs or device for any use, despite the companies’ claims that these products could be used to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent conditions such as inflammation, chronic diarrhea, bacterial infections, head lice, allergies and pain. Basic Reset and Biogenyx also unlawfully distributed dietary supplements that are adulterated and misbranded. During inspections at the facility, FDA investigators found numerous violations of the CGMP requirements for dietary supplements, including failing to establish specifications to ensure that the products they receive for labeling are adequately identified and consistent with the purchase order and failing to establish and follow written procedures to review and investigate product complaints. Because the defendants failed to follow CGMP regulations, their dietary supplements are considered adulterated. Several of the defendants’ dietary supplements are also missing information on their labels required by law, rendering those products misbranded.  Additionally, defendants distributed a device that is adulterated and misbranded. According to the complaint, despite previous warnings from the FDA and repeated promises to correct deficiencies, defendants continued to violate the law. As a result of these violations, today, U.S. District Judge William L. Campbell, Jr. for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, entered a consent decree of permanent injunction against Basic Reset and Biogenyx, sole proprietorships, Fred R. Kaufman III, owner, and Kimberly Kaufman. The complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, sought a permanent injunction against the Hendersonville, Tenn., drug, dietary supplement and device distributors and the companies’ most responsible individuals. This action follows multiple FDA inspections conducted at Basic Reset and Biogenyx between 2012 and 2017. The FDA issued a to the companies in 2016 for similar violations. Despite assurances that the violations noted in the warning letter would be corrected, follow-up inspections revealed that the defendants had failed to make the necessary corrections. The consent decree prohibits Basic Reset and Biogenyx and the other defendants from directly or indirectly receiving, labeling, holding, or distributing dietary supplements, drugs or devices at or from their facility until they take certain steps to ensure that all of these products comply with the law including, among other things, recalling their drugs, dietary supplements and device products, hiring qualified experts to ensure conformity with CGMP and other requirements and receiving written permission from the FDA to resume operations.

{"title": "FDA approves first treatment for patients with rare type of lung disease", "date": "September 06, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ofev (nintedanib) capsules to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adults with interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma, called SSc-ILD. It is the first FDA-approved treatment for this rare lung condition. “Patients suffering from scleroderma need effective therapies, and the FDA supports the efforts of drug companies that are designing and conducting the clinical trials necessary to bring treatment options to scleroderma patients,” said Nikolay Nikolov, M.D., associate director for Rheumatology of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Nintedanib is now a treatment option to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients who have interstitial lung disease from scleroderma.” Scleroderma is a rare disease that causes tissue throughout the body, including the lungs and other organs, to thicken and scar. Interstitial lung disease or ILD is a condition affecting the interstitium, which is part of the lung’s structure, and is one of the most common disease manifestations of sclerderma. SSc-ILD is a progressive lung disease in which lung function declines over time, and it can be debilitating and life-threatening. ILD is the leading cause of death among people with scleroderma, typically resulting from a loss of pulmonary function that occurs when the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the heart. Approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States have scleroderma, and approximately half of scleroderma patients have SSc-ILD. The effectiveness of Ofev to treat SSc-ILD was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 576 patients ages 20-79 with the disease. Patients received treatment for 52 weeks, with some patients treated up to 100 weeks. The primary test for efficacy measured the forced vital capacity, or FVC, which is a measure of lung function, defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Those who took Ofev had less lung function decline compared to those on placebo. The overall safety profile observed in the Ofev treatment group was consistent with the known safety profile of the therapy. The most frequent serious adverse event reported in patients treated with Ofev was pneumonia (2.8% Ofev vs. 0.3% placebo). Adverse reactions leading to permanent dose reductions were reported in 34% of Ofev-treated patients compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent dose reduction in patients treated with Ofev. The prescribing information for Ofev includes warnings for patients with moderate or severe hepatic (liver) impairment, those with elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury and patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Ofev may also cause embryo-fetal toxicity that can result in fetal harm, arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots), bleeding and gastrointestinal perforation. P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase nintedanib exposure, and patients taking these inhibitors should be closely monitored for tolerability of Ofev. Common side effects noted with Ofev include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver enzyme elevation, decreased appetite, headache, weight loss and hypertension (high blood pressure). Ofev was originally approved in 2014 for adult patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is another interstitial lung condition. Ofev received designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. Ofev also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Ofev to treat SSc-ILD to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.

{"title": "FDA warns JUUL Labs for marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products, including in outreach to youth", "date": "September 09, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to JUUL Labs Inc. for marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products by engaging in labeling, advertising, and/or other activities directed to consumers, including a presentation given to youth at a school. The agency also sent a expressing concern, and requesting more information, about several issues raised in a recent Congressional hearing regarding JUUL’s outreach and marketing practices, including those targeted at students, tribes, health insurers and employers. These letters are the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken as part of its continued commitment to providing strong oversight of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and the latest development in the FDA’s ongoing investigation related to JUUL. “Regardless of where products like e-cigarettes fall on the continuum of tobacco product risk, the law is clear that, before marketing tobacco products for reduced risk, companies must demonstrate with scientific evidence that their specific product does in fact pose less risk or is less harmful. JUUL has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation’s youth,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “In addition, we’re troubled about several issues related to JUUL’s outreach and marketing practices that came to light in a recent Congressional hearing. We will continue to scrutinize tobacco product marketing and take action as appropriate to ensure that the public is not misled into believing a certain product has been proven less risky or less harmful. We remain committed to using all available tools to ensure that e-cigarettes and other tobacco products aren’t being marketed or sold to kids. We’ve also put the industry on notice: If the disturbing rise in youth e-cigarette use continues, especially through the use of flavors that appeal to kids, we’ll take even more aggressive action.” As stated in the warning letter, the FDA has determined that JUUL has marketed its products as without an appropriate FDA order in effect. JUUL’s labeling, advertising, and/or other activities directed to consumers represent, or would be reasonably expected to result in consumers believing, that the products 1) present a lower risk of tobacco-related disease or are less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products; 2) contain a reduced level of a substance or present a reduced exposure to a substance; and/or 3) do not contain or are free of a substance or substances. The warning letter identifies several statements, including statements discussed in testimony from a July 2019 Congressional hearing on JUUL. According to that testimony, a JUUL representative speaking with students at his presentation in a school stated that: Additionally, a “Letter from the CEO” that appeared on JUUL’s website, and also in an email that JUUL sent to a parent in response to her complaint that the company sold JUUL products to her child, states: “[JUUL’s] simple and convenient system incorporates temperature regulation to heat nicotine liquid and deliver smokers the satisfaction that they want without the combustion and the harm associated with it.” The FDA has requested that JUUL provide a written response within 15 working days describing its corrective actions and its plan for maintaining compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), including its plan to prevent the same or similar violations. Failure to ensure compliance with FD&C Act may result in the FDA initiating further action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. Further, the agency sent an additional letter to JUUL that notes that despite commitments JUUL has made to address this epidemic, JUUL products continue to represent a significant proportion of the overall use of ENDS products by children. Some of this youth use appears to have been a direct result of JUUL’s product design and promotional activities and outreach efforts. The letter outlines several additional issues of concern, including statements and representations made as part of JUUL’s “Make the Switch” campaign and JUUL’s “Switching Program” presentation to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, such as: The agency is concerned these statements and representations may convey that switching to JUUL is a safer alternative to cigarettes, in that using JUUL products poses less risk or is less harmful than cigarettes. The FDA is requesting documents and information about these practices, including any and all scientific evidence or data, such as consumer perception studies, related to whether these statements and representations explicitly or implicitly convey that JUUL products pose less risk, are less harmful, present reduced exposure, are safer than other tobacco products or that the products are smoking cessation products. The FDA is also asking JUUL to explain why it uses nicotine salts, which was described at the Congressional hearing as masking the harshness of nicotine. The agency further asks JUUL why it uses a nicotine concentration of 5% in its products, which the agency is concerned could potentially increase their addictiveness. The FDA is requesting documents and information on, among other things, JUUL’s use of nicotine salts in its e-liquids and the concentration of nicotine in its products. The FDA has requested that JUUL provide the requested documents and information to the agency within 30 days of the date of the letter. The agency previously requested documents from JUUL Labs in April 2018 to examine the reportedly high rates of youth use and the youth appeal of JUUL products. The FDA has also conducted an unannounced inspection of JUUL’s corporate headquarters. Additionally, the agency has conducted inspections of several of JUUL’s contract manufacturing facilities to determine compliance with all applicable FDA laws and regulatory requirements. As part of the agency’s , the FDA continues work on all fronts to tackle the troubling epidemic of youth e-cigarette use through all available regulatory tools. This includes taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market or sell these products to minors, investigating counterfeit e-cigarette products, educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes, and implementing the policies necessary to keep them out of the hands of America’s kids. Separately, the FDA with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local public health partners to investigate the recent respiratory illnesses associated with vaping as quickly as possible and the agency is committed to taking appropriate actions as the facts emerge. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. JUUL “was much safer than cigarettes” and that “FDA would approve it any day.” JUUL was “totally safe.” A student “…should mention JUUL to his [nicotine-addicted] friend…because that’s a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes, and it would be better for the kid to use.” “FDA was about to come out and say it [JUUL] was 99% safer than cigarettes…and that…would happen very soon….” “‘[JUUL is] a smart, really well thought-out alternative to smoking.’ Make the switch.” “I think [JUUL is] an amazing invention…I don’t know how we lived without that. The alternative for adult smokers.” “Elimination of combustible cigarettes is crucial to reduce risk of harm” “Improve the lives of the world’s one billion adult smokers”"},
{"title": "Statement on improving adverse event reporting of compounded drugs to protect patients", "date": "September 09, 2019", "contents": " Compounded drugs can serve an important medical need for certain patients, however, they also to patients since they are not evaluated by the FDA for safety, effectiveness and quality. The FDA’s compounding program aims to help protect patients from poor-quality compounded drugs, while preserving access to lawfully-marketed compounded drugs for patients who have a medical need for them.  Along with the development of policy and enforcement of the law, and collaboration with states and industry, our inspections of compounding facilities are vital aspects of this effort. Understanding the nature of the activity these compounders—especially outsourcing facilities— are engaged in helps minimize the risks to patients. While the FDA inspects outsourcing facilities regularly according to our risk-based schedule, we also rely on them to do their part in alerting us to issues that may endanger the health of patients. As part of this work, several colleagues and I recently a particular issue associated with compounded hormones (specifically, in the form of pellets). During an inspection in 2018 of BioTE Medical, our investigators uncovered information about 4,202 adverse events that had never been reported to the agency. The adverse event information our investigators found suggested compounded hormone pellets were possibly associated with endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, strokes, heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis and pellet extrusion. However, because the reports lacked certain critical information, the FDA was able to attribute only a small percentage of the adverse events (61 reports), such as pellet extrusion and cellulitis, to the use of compounded hormone pellets containing testosterone. The company that collected the adverse events did not send them to us during the five years they occurred between 2013 and 2018. However, in light of this discovery, the FDA is continuing to take multiple steps to help protect patients, which we wanted to highlight today in the interest of public health. Compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) products such as progesterone and testosterone, are used at times instead of FDA-approved drugs for hormone replacement therapy. Some compounders market BHRT products as superior to FDA-approved drugs by making assertions that they are more natural, safer or better for patients than FDA-approved drug products. FDA-approved hormone therapy treatments have been reviewed for safety and effectiveness for specific uses, and the FDA has measures in place to ensure quality during manufacturing. However, because, compounded BHRT products are not approved by the agency, there is no assurance of safety and efficacy. Outsourcing facilities, such as those that produced these products, are required to report certain adverse events to the FDA. The agency uses adverse event reports to monitor safety issues to help protect the public. Adverse event reports can assist the FDA in identifying potential safety problems with a particular product. However, this is more difficult when information is outdated or missing. We maintain a to ensure patients and health care professionals can access adverse event data about drugs. Outsourcing facilities are required to report adverse events to the agency and include adverse event reporting information on compounded drug labeling, and we encourage all companies, health care professionals and patients to report adverse events as soon as they know about them. Every year, the FDA receives adverse event reports of patient illnesses and deaths associated with compounded drugs. Information on the safety history of compounded drugs, through the reporting of adverse events is vital to protecting the public health. Because compounding can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug, we must work to protect patients from the risk of contaminated or otherwise harmful products. As we develop our policy and oversight program, the FDA continually strives to strike a balance between preserving access to compounded drugs for patients who have a medical need for them while protecting patients from the risks associated with compounded drugs that are not made in accordance with applicable quality standards or other requirements. In this case, outsourcing facilities, Carie Boyd’s Prescription Shop and AnazaoHealth Corporation, produced the pellets, but they were marketed by BioTe Medical, which was not registered with the agency as an outsourcing facility. While BioTe had an online portal to collect adverse event data from its customers, it never reported that information to the FDA nor did it provide this information to the outsourcing facilities. The FDA is still investigating this matter, with respect to Carie Boyd’s Prescription Shop, AnazaoHealth Corporation or BioTe and we cannot discuss the status. Outsourcing facilities are subject to regulatory and enforcement action if they do not appropriately label their drugs with adverse event reporting information and to report events to the FDA. The agency intends to take appropriate action if outsourcing facilities do not comply with the adverse event reporting requirements. We remind outsourcing facilities to develop thorough procedures to compile and investigate adverse event reports and share them with the FDA. We’re also using the information we learned from this episode to take steps to improve adverse event reporting and analyses to ensure we’re doing the most we can to protect patients. We will continue to work with outsourcing facilities to improve mechanisms for obtaining reports of adverse events associated with their products and for providing adverse event reports to the agency.  Furthermore, we continue to work with our state regulatory partners to finalize a standard memorandum of understanding under which states would agree to, among other things, investigate complaints of adverse events associated with certain compounded drugs from pharmacies operating under section 503A and report serious adverse events and serious product quality issues to the agency. States that sign the with the FDA will agree to investigate and share their findings. Collaboration with states has the potential to help prevent serious and widespread problems by helping to better identify adverse events and product quality issues across the country. For example, if a compounder distributes drugs to multiple states, it can be difficult to gather information about possible adverse events associated with those drugs, connect them to the compounder and undertake coordinated action to address a potentially serious public health problem. Collaboration with our state partners would be crucial in such an instance. While adverse event reports have some limitations, this information is one of the best safety tools we have at our disposal. The FDA is dedicated to increasing public awareness about drug safety issues and we’re continuing our efforts to improve reporting for all types of drugs, including compounded medicines. We anticipate finalizing our MOU with the states later this year. To further enhance our understanding of the safety of compounded hormones, the FDA has contracted with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a study on the risks associated with compounded hormone products. Our collaboration with NASEM will also continue to examine the clinical utility of treating patients with compounded products and the available evidence of the safety and effectiveness of multi-ingredient compounded topical pain creams. The FDA plans to share updates about this study with the public as information is available. We’ll continue to work to ensure patients have appropriate access to compounded medications. However, we must also ensure that all steps are taken to help reduce risks to patients. Patient health and safety is the FDA’s highest priority. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA expands indication for several transcatheter heart valves to patients at low risk for death or major complications associated with open-heart surgery", "date": "August 16, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved an expanded indication for several transcatheter heart valves to include patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (a narrowing of the heart’s aortic valve that restricts blood flow to aorta, the body’s main artery) who are at low risk for death or major complications associated with open-heart surgery to replace the damaged valves. These transcatheter valves – Sapien 3, Sapien 3 Ultra, CoreValve Evolut R and CoreValve Evolut PRO – were previously indicated only for patients at intermediate or higher risk for death or major complications during open-heart surgery. In low risk patients, open-heart surgery has been the standard-of-care for aortic valve replacement. However, the procedure to insert a transcatheter heart valve is less invasive, and involves a smaller incision and shorter recovery time than open-heart surgery. The FDA is the first medical products regulatory body in the world to expand the indication for these devices to patients at low risk for death or major complications associated with open-heart surgery. “This new approval significantly expands the number of patients that can be treated with this less invasive procedure for aortic valve replacement and follows a thorough review of data demonstrating these devices are safe and effective for this larger population,” said Bram Zuckerman, M.D., director of the Office of Cardiovascular Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “As the FDA assesses new medical technologies or expanded uses for previously approved products such as these, the agency remains committed to evaluating evidence from clinical trials and real-world clinical data in both the premarket and postmarket settings to ensure patients have access to high-quality, safe, and effective medical devices.” The incidence of aortic valve stenosis increases with age. As the aortic valve opening narrows, the heart must work harder to pump blood to the body. Occurring in about 3% of Americans over age 75, severe aortic valve stenosis can cause fainting, chest pain, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), cardiac arrest or death. Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis generally need to undergo heart valve replacement to improve blood flow through their aortic valve. In a clinical study to evaluate safety and effectiveness, 503 patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical complications were randomly selected to have aortic valve replacement with the Sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve, and 497 were randomly selected to have aortic valve replacement with traditional open-heart surgery using an approved surgical tissue valve. In a separate study, 734 low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were randomly selected to have aortic valve replacement with the CoreValve Evolut R or CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter valve, and 734 were randomly selected to have aortic valve replacement with traditional open-heart surgery using an approved surgical tissue valve. At an average of 15-17 months follow-up, when outcomes (such as all-cause mortality or stroke) for transcatheter and surgical patients were compared, the transcatheter heart valve achieved comparable results to surgery, demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the transcatheter heart valves in low surgical risk patients. Like open-heart valve replacement surgery, treatment with transcatheter heart valves is associated with a potential risk of serious complications. The serious complications associated with the uses of these devices include death, stroke, acute kidney injury, heart attack, bleeding, and the need for a permanent pacemaker. The transcatheter heart valves should not be used in patients who cannot tolerate blood thinning medications or have an active infection in the heart or elsewhere. Additionally, the CoreValve Evolut R and CoreValve Evolut PRO devices should not be used in patients who have sensitivity to titanium or nickel. Furthermore, the long-term durability of transcatheter heart valves compared to surgically implanted valves has not been established. Patients, especially younger ones, should discuss available treatment options with their heart care team to select the therapy that best meets their expectations and lifestyle. These devices were approved using the . Premarket approval is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA and is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). As part of the approval of these devices, the FDA is requiring each manufacturer to continue to follow patients enrolled in their randomized studies for 10 years to further monitor transcatheter aortic valve safety and effectiveness, including the long-term valve durability. The manufacturers will also participate in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry to provide FDA with additional surveillance of these devices over a 10-year period.

{"title": "FDA approves new device to improve symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure", "date": "August 16, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the Barostim Neo System for the improvement of symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure who are not suited for treatment with other heart failure devices, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy. The FDA gave the device a because it treats a life-threatening disease, heart failure, and addresses an unmet medical need in patients who fail to get adequate benefits from standard treatments and have no alternative treatment options. “Patients with advanced heart failure have limitations of physical activity, experiencing fatigue, palpitation or shortness of breath with activity and may not benefit from standard treatments, including currently marketed drugs and devices. This approval provides patients with a new treatment option for the symptoms associated with advanced heart failure,” said Bram Zuckerman, M.D., director of the Office of Cardiovascular Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA continues to work with manufacturers through our Breakthrough Devices Program to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to medical devices that have the potential to lead to a clinical improvement in patients, such as those with this irreversibly debilitating condition, while ensuring these devices meet our regulatory requirements for safety and effectiveness.” About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. The leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment for heart failure includes treating the underlying causes and reducing symptoms such as fatigue and swelling in the lower extremities that make physical activity difficult. Doctors may prescribe medications like angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or beta blockers to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart, as well as diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and swelling in the feet and ankles. The Barostim Neo System includes a pulse generator that is implanted below the collar bone and is connected to a lead that attaches to the carotid artery in the neck. After the device is implanted, a physician tests and programs the device, which delivers electrical impulses to cells in the neck called baroreceptors, which sense how blood is flowing through the carotid arteries and relays information to the brain. The brain, in turn, sends signals to the heart and blood vessels that relax the blood vessels and inhibit the production of stress-related hormones to reduce heart failure symptoms. The FDA evaluated data from a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized clinical trial with a total of 408 patients with advanced heart failure. All patients received guideline-directed medical therapy, including medication, and 125 patients also received a Barostim Neo System implant. Patients receiving the implant showed improvements in the distance they were able to walk in six-minute walking tests and improvements in how symptoms impacted their quality of life. Also in the trial, 120 randomized subjects with less severe chronic heart failure found benefit in lowering levels of a biomarker that measures heart failure. Potential complications associated with the implantation or use of the device include: infection; need for reoperation; low blood pressure that may cause dizziness, fainting, and/or falls; nerve damage; surgical or anesthetic complications; allergic reaction; arterial damage; exacerbation of heart failure; stroke; and death. The Barostim Neo System is indicated for patients who have a regular heart rhythm, are not candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and have a left ventricular ejection fraction (the total amount of blood pumped out in each heart beat) of less than or equal to 35%, which is considered below the normal ejection fraction of 55 to 75%. The device is contraindicated for patients with anatomy that would impair implantation of the device, certain nervous system disorders, uncontrolled and symptomatic slow heart rate, atherosclerosis or ulcerative plaques near the implant location and patients with a known allergy to silicone or titanium. The device was approved using the . Premarket approval is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA and is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). As part of the approval of this device, the FDA is requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-approval study investigating the potential of the therapy to prolong life and reduce the need for patient hospitalization. The FDA granted the Barostim Neo System a , meaning the agency provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development, to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the device. To qualify for such designation, a device must provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition. All designated devices must meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients.

{"title": "FDA approves new antibiotic to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia", "date": "August 19, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Xenleta (lefamulin) to treat adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. “This new drug provides another option for the treatment of patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, a serious disease,” said Ed Cox, M.D., M.P.H., director of FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products. “For managing this serious disease, it is important for physicians and patients to have treatment options. This approval reinforces our ongoing commitment to address treatment of infectious diseases by facilitating the development of new antibiotics.” Community-acquired pneumonia occurs when someone develops pneumonia in the community (not in a hospital). Pneumonia is a type of lung infection that can range in severity from mild to severe illness and can affect people of all ages. According to from the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention, each year in the United States, about one million people are hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and 50,000 people die from the disease. The safety and efficacy of Xenleta, taken either orally or intravenously, was evaluated in two clinical trials with a total of 1,289 patients with CABP. In these trials, treatment with Xenleta was compared to another antibiotic, moxifloxacin with or without linezolid. The trials showed that patients treated with Xenleta had similar rates of clinical success as those treated with moxifloxacin with or without linezolid. The most common adverse reactions reported in patients taking Xenleta included diarrhea, nausea, reactions at the injection site, elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Xenleta has the potential to cause a change on an ECG reading (prolonged QT interval). Patients with prolonged QT interval, patients with certain irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), patients receiving treatment for certain irregular heart rhythms (antiarrhythmic agents), and patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval should avoid Xenleta. In addition, Xenleta should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to lefamulin or any other members of the pleuromutilin antibiotic class, or any of the components of Xenleta. Based on findings of fetal harm in animal studies, pregnant women and women who could become pregnant should be advised of the potential risks of Xenleta to a fetus. Women who could become pregnant should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Xenleta and for two days after the final dose. Xenleta received FDA’s (QIDP) designation. The QIDP designation is given to antibacterial and antifungal drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. As part of QIDP designation, Xenleta was granted under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within an expedited time frame. The FDA granted the approval of Xenleta to Nabriva Therapeutics. A key global challenge the FDA faces as a public health agency is addressing the threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections. Among the FDA’s other efforts to address antimicrobial resistance, is the focus on facilitating the development of safe and effective new treatments to give patients more options to fight serious infections.

Today, we are proud to be highlighting the continued success and tangible impact “The Real Cost” campaign has had on youth smoking initiation in a published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. The study, which builds on , shows that our award-winning campaign has prevented up to 587,000 youth nationwide from initiating smoking between the campaign’s launch in February 2014 and November 2016, half of whom might have gone on to become established smokers. Preventing youth from smoking is not only critical to each teen who does not become an addicted smoker, but these results are also enormously beneficial to public health. Tobacco use – largely from cigarette smoking – still kills more than 480,000 Americans every single year and costs nearly $300 billion a year in direct health care expenses and lost productivity due to premature death. Additionally, almost 90 percent of adult smokers started smoking by the age of 18 and approximately 2,000 youth smoke their first cigarette every day in the U.S., making youth prevention efforts critical. The results from our work demonstrate that “The Real Cost” will have lasting benefits on public health by convincing these teens to not smoke and it’s imperative that public education campaigns like ours continue in order to reduce the individual and collective burden of tobacco-related disease and death among current and future generations. In fact, using the same methodology as our , it is estimated that by preventing hundreds of thousands of youth from becoming established adult smokers, “The Real Cost” will save more than $53 billion for youth, their families and society at large by reducing smoking-related costs like early loss of life, costly medical care, lost wages, lower productivity and increased disability. Ultimately this means the campaign to educate the more than 10 million at-risk teens in the U.S. about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking saved $180 for every dollar of the nearly $250 million invested in the campaign. Importantly, our youth tobacco prevention efforts are developed and evaluated using evidence-based best practices to ensure that we’re reaching our audience with powerful messages that raise awareness, shift beliefs and ultimately save lives by changing behaviors. Since “The Real Cost” launched in 2014, it has reached up to 95% of its target U.S. youth audience aged 12-17 with thousands of messages through TV, digital, social, outdoor and radio platforms. More than 21.9 million youth have spent time on TheRealCost.gov since its launch in 2014 and 31.6 million youth have engaged with the FDA on social media. Capitalizing on its success, the agency has expanded over the last several years to include advertising about the harms of smokeless tobacco use, and more recently to educate youth that using e-cigarettes – just like cigarettes – puts them at risk for addiction and other health consequences. As we continue to tackle the troubling epidemic of youth vaping that threatens to erase the progress we’ve made combatting tobacco use among kids, we’re extremely confident that these proven practices will help us succeed in our related efforts to educate them about the dangers of e-cigarette use. Earlier this year, our youth e-cigarette prevention campaign about the emerging science that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to start smoking cigarettes. We’ve also launched several other targeting youth and young adults. As part of our , we will maintain our energy and focus on using our authorities forcefully to keep tobacco products out of the hands of America’s kids, with a particular emphasis on the threat of youth vaping. This includes advancing policies to limit youth access to, and appeal of, e-cigarettes and other products; exploring clear and meaningful measures to make tobacco products less toxic, appealing and addictive; taking vigorous compliance and enforcement actions to hold manufacturers and retailers accountable when they illegally market or sell these products to minors; and continuing to spearhead highly successful public education efforts to warn youth about the dangers of all tobacco products. The success of our work in protecting kids from the dangers of tobacco use has been clearly demonstrated through these efforts and we will continue using every tool possible to ensure the next generation of young people do not become addicted to any tobacco products.

{"title": "FDA warns company for putting consumers at risk with drug manufacturing data integrity violations", "date": "August 20, 2019", "contents": " Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration posted a to Ningbo Huize Commodity Co., an over-the-counter (OTC) drug manufacturer, for significant current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) violations, including data integrity issues. “Americans deserve to have confidence in the quality of drugs the FDA regulates – from the prescription medicines they take to the over-the-counter products they use in their daily lives, like toothpaste and sunscreen. Helping assure the quality and safety of these products is one of our greatest responsibilities as a public health agency. In recent years, the FDA has focused additional resources on efforts to prevent, uncover and combat data integrity lapses. We’ve focused comprehensive new efforts on these risks, both through our global inspections program as well as providing updated guidance, and to train our staff on identifying concerns related to data integrity,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “Today’s action shows our continued commitment in our oversight of over-the-counter drug manufacturing and protecting consumers from products that may put them at risk.” The warning letter issued to Ningbo Huize details a failure to have adequate quality control mechanisms in place. The company provided FDA investigators multiple documents that were falsified, including the cleaning validation reports and batch production and control records for multiple drugs. The firm also provided records showing they performed the required periodic reviews of their operation to assure quality, which they later admitted were also falsified. These CGMP violations cause all drugs manufactured by Ningbo Huize to be adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The FDA also considers the adulterated products to be misbranded because the product labels did not include all the required information and directions for use. The labels of OTC medicines must comply with all requirements of the FD&C Act and applicable regulations. Following the inspection in March 2019, the FDA placed the company on import alert in June 2019 to prevent their drugs from entering the U.S. market. The company has also agreed to voluntarily recall drugs. The FDA requested a response from the company within 15 working days of receipt of the letter. The company is directed to inform the agency of the specific actions taken to address each of the agency’s concerns. The warning letter also states that failure to correct violations may result in the FDA continuing to refuse admission of products manufactured at the company’s facility. The FDA has uncovered circumstances of drug quality data and information being inaccurate, which can mask problems and failures. Patients cannot be assured of the safety and effectiveness of their medication when data has been altered. One critical way to help ensure product quality is to prevent data integrity lapses from the outset. Over the past two decades, the FDA has publicly outlined its expectations for the accuracy, reliability and truthfulness of all data and information collected by drug manufacturers. In 2018, the agency updated on ensuring data integrity and compliance with CGMP. The FDA’s aims to help manufacturers have the tools and systems in place to prevent adulterated products from entering the U.S. marketplace. Pharmaceutical quality can only be assured by robust quality control, which includes vigilant oversight of data integrity. This helps ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality of the drug products produced for the American public. When the agency finds manufacturers who are not complying with data integrity requirements, the FDA takes action against those manufacturers’ practices and works to bring them into compliance. Most manufacturers are complying with the CGMP regulations and following technical standards outlined in guidances and in meetings with stakeholders and Americans should continue to use the OTC products, like sunscreen and toothpaste, they produce. The FDA will continue to ensure that drug manufacturers around the globe meet the required standards for drug quality that American consumers expect.

{"title": "Statement calling on all sectors of the papaya industry to improve practices to better protect consumers", "date": "August 26, 2019", "contents": " Every day Americans enjoy an abundant food supply that is among the safest in the world. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration works tirelessly to ensure that foods available to consumers, whether they are produced domestically or abroad, meet the FDA’s food safety requirements and that we are using all available tools to ensure compliance. As demand and tastes continue to drive change in the market, consumers’ desire for a variety of products available year-round have increased the number of imported foods offered for sale in the U.S. To keep up with this trend, we have doubled down on our efforts to ensure the safety of imported food. This includes issuing a new and requesting from Congress to support our efforts. While we continue to focus on shifting our work upholding food safety from response to prevention, we know that there are times where we will still need to respond to problems when they arise, including outbreaks of foodborne illness. This is especially important when we see recurrent patterns of illness associated with particular commodities. For example, fresh papayas. This commodity is most often eaten raw, without cooking or processing to eliminate microbial hazards; and therefore, the way they are grown, harvested, packed, held, processed and distributed is crucial to minimizing the risk of contamination with human pathogens. Unfortunately, since 2011, American consumers have been exposed to eight outbreaks caused by serotypes linked to imported, fresh papaya. And, just this June we started an investigation into an Uganda illnesses tied to the consumption of whole, fresh papaya imported from Mexico. While the 2019 outbreak is ongoing, the first seven outbreaks accounted for almost 500 reported cases of illness, more than 100 hospitalizations, and two deaths. This trend has to stop. The pattern of recurrent outbreaks we have observed since 2011, including the 2019 illnesses, have involved infections traced back to, or are suspected of being associated with, papaya grown in Mexico. The recurring nature of these outbreaks is a clear indication that more must be done within all sectors of the papaya industry to protect its customers and to meet its legal obligations. This includes growers, importers and even retailers that can and must do more. This is why today we have issued a calling on all sectors of the papaya industry to take actions to prevent these outbreaks in the future. We are urging growers, packers, shippers and retailers in the papaya industry to review their operations and make all necessary changes to strengthen public health safeguards. Our letter calls on the papaya industry to assess the factors that make their crops vulnerable to contamination. If a foodborne pathogen is identified in the crop or growing environment, a root cause analysis should be performed to determine the likely source of contamination. Procedures and practices that minimize that contamination must be implemented. We are strongly encouraging the papaya industry to examine the use and monitoring of water used to grow, spray (pesticides, fungicides), move, rinse or wax crops to identify and minimize risks from potential hazards. All sectors of the industry should adopt tools and practices needed to enhance traceability since papayas are a perishable commodity, to more rapidly facilitate the tracking of involved product to expedite its removal from commerce, prevent additional consumer exposures, and properly focus any recall actions. And finally, they should fund and actively engage in food safety research to identify the potential sources and routes of contamination by microbial pathogens and develop data-driven and risk-based preventive controls. In response to this most recent Uganda outbreak, the FDA deployed an inspection team to the packing house and farm that was linked to the contaminated papayas via traceback and epidemiological evidence. The findings of those visits will be made public when their investigation is complete. We have also increased sampling and screening of papayas at the border. In addition, the FDA is actively collaborating with our counterparts in the Mexican government regarding this current outbreak through the agency’s Latin America Office to determine ways to further our collaborative prevention efforts. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits food producers from introducing, or delivering for introduction, into interstate commerce adulterated foods (meaning foods that are potentially harmful to consumers). Additionally, there are new requirements under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The under FSMA sets science- and risk-based minimum standards for domestic and foreign farms for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of covered produce, which includes papayas. Another FSMA rule, the (FSVP) makes importers responsible for verifying that the foods they bring into the U.S., including papayas, have been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. safety standards. We take our responsibility to protect public health very seriously and will continue to use all of our regulatory authorities and enforcement tools available to do so. So, today we issued a warning letter to a papaya importer, Agroson’s LLC, following an FDA investigation at the facility in conjunction with the current outbreak. This investigation uncovered significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Rest assured that the FDA will continue to strengthen safeguards and prevent contaminated papayas from being imported into the U.S. Our efforts also include education, outreach, training and research activities designed to support farmers’ efforts to keep their crops safe for consumers. Although today’s actions focus on the papaya industry, recurring outbreaks taking place with any commodity are unacceptable from a public health perspective. We know that more must be done by industry as repeated illness outbreaks are a threat to public health. In such situations, it is incumbent upon all sectors of the industry to work together to investigate the cause, review food safety procedures and practices, and take action to prevent further outbreaks. We must take collective steps to eliminate the threat that recurring outbreaks pose to consumers and look forward to working with the papaya industry as well as all food producers to ensure that America’s food supply remains among the safest in the world. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on the agency’s ongoing efforts to resolve safety issue with ARB medications", "date": "August 28, 2019", "contents": " Protecting patients is the FDA’s highest priority, and Americans can be confident in the quality of the products the agency approves. The recent Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) recalls have deeply concerned patients, the medical community, the agency and international regulatory bodies. The FDA is aware many patients rely on ARB medicines, and we are concerned about the presence of nitrosamine impurities in these drugs. Millions of people benefit from the high-quality products that the FDA regulates, and the U.S. has the most robust drug supply in the world, with strict standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. As part of our efforts to be transparent regarding impurities in ARBs, we want to make sure patients have a full understanding of how these impurities may affect them. Notably, we would like to stress that the actual risk to patients is likely much lower than our estimates, which reflect a scientific assessment of the highest possible exposure. We that if 8,000 people took the highest valsartan dose (320 mg) containing N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) from the recalled batches daily for four years, there may be one additional case of cancer over the lifetimes of those 8,000 people. In reality, the vast majority of patients exposed to NDMA through ARBs received much smaller amounts of the impurity than this worst-case scenario, and, since not all ARBs are affected, it’s very likely that a patient taking an ARB for four years would not have always received one of the affected products. One question we have received from many patients and other stakeholders is how big the impact has been – how many patients have been affected? While we know the number of patients taking ARB medicines, we do not know the exact number of patients impacted by these ARB recalls. The reasons for this are nuanced. For example, we understand that health care professionals, out of an abundance of caution, may have replaced their patients’ ARB prescriptions that were not part of the announced recalls. Because patients’ prescription bottles do not always identify lot numbers, it was difficult for patients and pharmacists to determine whether a medicine was part of the recalls. Patients may have returned medication unnecessarily if their supply was not part of a recall, but they were unsure. Therefore, we estimate there were likely more drugs replaced due to recalls than necessary, which means more patients were impacted but not necessarily exposed to an impurity. Manufacturers only estimate the number of products still in the distribution chain that are subject to recall, but not the number of impacted patients. However, through our ongoing track and trace efforts for prescription drugs in the supply chain, we’re working on ways to improve industry’s ability to track, detect and remove potentially dangerous drugs from the supply chain more rapidly and efficiently. ARB medications that contain impurities above the published interim acceptable limits continue to be recalled, with certain exceptions. However, it’s also important to underscore that there are ARB medicines that remain on the market and have been determined not to contain any nitrosamine impurities. We continue to encourage patients talk to a health care professional if they have questions about their medicine, as the risks of stopping taking an ARB product for treating high blood pressure and heart failure greatly outweighs the potential risk of exposure to trace amounts of nitrosamines. As we continue our analysis of this situation to better understand the root causes, we’re learning more about how nitrosamine impurities in ARBs. Through each step of our investigation, we’ve uncovered new information and taken a number of actions, including regulatory and advisory actions, where appropriate, to prevent the presence of unacceptable levels of these impurities. For example, earlier this month, we issued a to Lantech Pharmaceuticals Limited in Telangana, India, for current good manufacturing practice violations. Lantech acts as a contract solvent recovery facility for valsartan active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing operations. When we inspected Lantech in March 2019, we determined that solvent recovered by the company contained N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and that Lantech had insufficiently assessed the risks associated with their processes and did not adequately investigate the impurities. Specifically, the warning letter cites Lantech’s failure to control and monitor procedures to recover solvents to ensure that they meet appropriate standards before reuse. After we gathered and evaluated all the facts, we placed Lantech on in June 2019, preventing API made using its recovered solvent from legally entering the U.S. We continue to work closely with our global regulatory partners, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Health Canada, and many others, to understand the full scope of this issue. We share inspectional findings, laboratory testing methods and results, and our assessments of root cause and impact. We are working to incorporate what we have learned about the process risks that caused these impurities into our oversight of drug manufacturing, which includes how we assess applications and changes to applications, as well as enhancing our inspection coverage to evaluate the controls in place to prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamine. For example, we plan to adjust inspections of API sites to include enhanced evaluation of impurity controls, particularly when the manufacturing process may lead to the formation of a nitrosamine or when recycled raw materials can create unacceptable contamination. In the past year, the agency has conducted multiple unannounced, for-cause inspections to evaluate the practices at various API manufacturers and to verify appropriate corrective actions to address the risk of nitrosamine contamination. We are also working to improve how companies submit manufacturing changes to the agency with the goal of further improving our review of the more than 5,000 quality-related application change requests (supplements) each year. We continue to work with our global regulatory partners and industry as members of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) to publish guidance on controlling impurities in drugs and managing changes (e.g., ). These guidances and others developed through ICH are revised as new impurities and risks are identified and have helped prevent unacceptable impurities in drugs. We work with manufacturers during application review and after marketing begins over the lifecycle of their drugs to evaluate proposed process changes, conduct facility inspections, test samples of marketed drugs, evaluate complaints, and investigate issues that arise, all to protect the safety and quality of medicines. We have known that certain drug manufacturing processes pose a risk for forming genotoxic impurities, and this is an issue the FDA and other regulators have been working on for a number of years – well before the nitrosamine impurities were discovered in ARBs last summer. In fact, we issued information to manufacturers regarding their responsibilities to assess the risks and implement appropriate controls for their manufacturing process. Now that we know of the nitrosamine impurity problem, we’re using these findings to inform our evaluation of medicines other than ARBs. We are testing samples of other drugs with similar manufacturing processes. If we detect a problem, we will take appropriate action. In the meantime, we continue to work with ARB manufacturers to remove all affected drugs from the market, and we work with API manufactures to fix their processes so they do not distribute affected API to drug product manufacturers. Our list of affected products and products without impurities remains available to the public, and we will update it when we have new information to share. We will also continue to provide timely updates about any future issues associated with this ongoing incident that may impact public health. As we work to safeguard the quality of our medicines, the American public can expect that we will act quickly to address any issue as soon as we find out about it to prevent as much harm to patients as possible. We’re also committed to communicating as transparently as possible. When we found out about the impurities in ARB products, we worked with industry and our international regulatory colleagues to understand the situation and take preventative measures. We have also communicated frequently over the past year to share timely safety and manufacturing information. We have consistently and transparently communicated with pharmacists, patients and health care professionals about the ARB recalls as they have evolved. Ultimately, our goal is to be certain that no ARBs with unacceptable impurity levels reach patients. Based on our current assessments, including lab testing, the agency has identified 43 ARB medications that have been determined not to contain any nitrosamine impurities. As we continue our assessments and as companies continue to manufacture ARBs without nitrosamine impurities to replenish the U.S. supply, we expect this figure to rise. We know that ARBs can be produced without nitrosamine impurities, and we are working with manufacturers to reach that point. The FDA has ongoing review, surveillance, compliance and pharmaceutical quality efforts across every product area, and we will continue to work with drug manufacturers to ensure safe, effective, and quality drug products for the American public. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA recommends health care facilities and manufacturers begin transitioning to duodenoscopes with disposable components to reduce risk of patient infection", "date": "August 29, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is that duodenoscope manufacturers and health care facilities transition to different types of duodenoscopes that may pose less risk to patient safety. Specifically, because of challenges with cleaning these devices for reuse (reprocessing) and persistent high levels of contamination, the agency is recommending moving away from using duodenoscopes with fixed endcaps to those with disposable components that include disposable endcaps—or to fully disposable duodenoscopes when they become available. Disposable designs simplify or eliminate the need for reprocessing, which may reduce between-patient duodenoscope contamination as compared to reusable, or fixed endcaps. “We recognize that a full transition away from conventional duodenoscopes to innovative models will take time and immediate transition is not possible for all health care facilities due to cost and market availability,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This is why we’re communicating with health care facilities now—so they can begin developing a transition plan to replace conventional duodenoscopes—and those facilities that are purchasing duodenoscopes with fixed endcaps can invest in the newer, innovative models. We are also encouraging the manufacturers of these duodenoscope models to assist health care facilities with their transition plans. We continue to work with manufacturers to increase the supply of disposable cap duodenoscopes and the development of other new and innovative device designs that will further minimize or eliminate the risk of patient infection. Duodenoscopes remain critical to life-saving care for many patients in the U.S. While the risk of infection from inadequate reprocessing is relatively low, we are taking action because of continuing elevated levels of contamination in duodenoscopes. Today we’re also announcing additional actions we’ve taken to advance continued efforts to help assure the safety of patients undergoing procedures with duodenoscopes, including FDA ordering new postmarket surveillance studies on duodenoscopes with disposable endcaps, requesting the inclusion of real-world contamination rates in duodenoscope labeling and issuing letters to manufacturers of certain test strips used to assess duodenoscope cleanliness that have not been through proper FDA premarket review. These actions announced today are part of our robust, ongoing effort to gather information on the effectiveness of duodenoscope reprocessing to prevent between-patient contamination.” Duodenoscopes—flexible, lighted tubes that are threaded through the mouth, throat and stomach into the top of the small intestine (duodenum)—are used in more than 500,000 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures a year, a potentially life-saving procedure to diagnose and treat problems in the pancreas and bile ducts. These complex devices include reusable and hard-to-clean components and must be cleaned and sanitized to be re-used, known as reprocessing, after each patient through a lengthy procedure – one that currently consists of hundreds of steps. Reprocessing of duodenoscopes involves cleaning outside surfaces, interior channels and the elevator recess to remove tissue and fluids, followed by treatment to kill microorganisms. After thorough cleaning, high-level disinfection is intended to reduce harmful microbes so that the device is reasonably assured to be free of the risk of disease transmission. Failure to correctly reprocess a duodenoscope could result in tissue or fluid from one patient remaining in a duodenoscope and potential for disease transmission. Information from postmarket surveillance human factors studies indicate that many steps in the reprocessing instructions cannot be reliably followed by health care facilities. The safety communication issued today also outlines results of the FDA required of each U.S. duodenoscope manufacturer ( ) to evaluate whether health care facility staff could understand and follow the manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions in real-world health care settings. The results of these studies suggest that users frequently had difficulty understanding and following manufacturers’ reprocessing instructions and were not able to successfully complete reprocessing, which may leave the duodenoscopes contaminated. The FDA continues to work with manufacturers to conduct additional testing and revise reprocessing instruction manuals, as appropriate. However, the best path to reducing the risk of disease transmission by duodenoscopes is through innovative device designs, such as those with disposable components, that make reprocessing easier, more effective or unnecessary. Fixed endcap duodenoscopes have a plastic or rubber cap permanently glued to the metal edges around the distal end to prevent tissue injury from the metal edges on the scopes, but when permanently affixed, the endcaps also limit the accessibility to clean the crevices at the distal end. The FDA is recommending health care facilities transition away from fixed endcap models including Olympus Corporation’s TJF-160F/VF, TJF-Q180V, PJF-160 and JF-140F; Fujifilm Medical Systems USA’s ED-530XT; and Pentax Medical’s ED-3490TK. The FDA has cleared two duodenoscopes with disposable end caps: . Additionally, other firms have publicly announced plans to develop fully disposable duodenoscopes. The FDA previously required from each U.S. duodenoscope manufacturer (Olympus, Fujifilm and Pentax) to determine the real-world contamination rates for duodenoscopes and serve as measures for the effectiveness of reprocessing. Because these studies continue to show elevated rates of contamination in fixed endcap duodenoscopes, including the presence of organisms more often associated with disease transmission, such as E. coli, the FDA believes that incorporating disposable components can simplify cleaning, reduce contamination and reduce disease transmission following reprocessing. While not every exposure to a contaminated scope leads to infection, any rate of contamination is concerning, which is why the FDA is taking multiple steps to address the issue. The FDA is recommending a gradual transition to duodenoscopes with disposable components because full market withdrawal of conventional, fixed endcap duodenoscopes is not feasible at this time. Removing these devices from the market too quickly could create a shortage of duodenoscopes and prevent patients from accessing this beneficial and often life-saving procedure. The FDA believes, at this time, the continued availability of these devices is in the best interest of the public health. The FDA is reminding patients that the risk of infection from inadequate reprocessing is relatively low and patients should not cancel or delay any planned procedure without first discussing the benefits and risks with a health care professional. In addition to transitioning to safer devices, the FDA is communicating with device manufacturers to encourage them to develop innovative approaches for the entire duodenoscope reprocessing procedure to provide a high margin of safety and reduce the risk of infection associated with reprocessed duodenoscopes. Also, the FDA announced that it has ordered manufacturers of duodenoscopes with disposable endcaps to conduct to gather more information and verify that the new designs reduce the contamination rate. The FDA believes that designs, such as ones with disposable endcaps, that need fewer reprocessing steps and allow for instructions that are easier to follow, can lower contamination rates and thus, help protect patients from the risk of infection. Upon completion of the postmarket surveillance studies, the FDA expects the labeling on duodenoscopes with disposable endcaps to be updated with contamination rate data. Including the contamination rate would allow patients and health care professionals to make informed decisions about the potential risks associated with the duodenoscope. In addition, after the May 2019 Centers for Disease Control Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, the FDA requested the inclusion of real-world contamination rates on the label of fixed endcap duodenoscopes. In addition, the FDA also announced today that it is aware that some health care facilities are using adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, test strips, to assess duodenoscope cleaning. These test strips claim to indicate the presence of live microbes inside of duodenoscopes. However, to date, the FDA is not aware of any legally marketed ATP test strips cleared by the agency for this use, which means the FDA has not reviewed them for effectiveness in assessing reprocessing. Prior to being legally marketed in the U.S., an FDA premarket review is necessary to help assure that ATP test strips are adequately validated and properly labeled. The FDA has contacted manufacturers of ATP test strips advising them of the FDA’s requirements for manufacturing, testing and labeling for medical devices marketed for assessing duodenoscope reprocessing and has requested they submit data to support the clearance of the strips for this use. As for any unauthorized use of a medical device, if the companies do not come into compliance, the agency will consider whether to take enforcement action if necessary. In the meantime, the FDA is asking health care facilities not to rely on these test strips to assess duodenoscope cleaning. Lastly, the FDA plans to convene a in late 2019 to discuss these issues, including duodenoscope contamination rates, expanding validated reprocessing methods, options to improve reprocessing, potential for sterilization of duodenoscopes, approaches for new device designs or technology to reduce infection transmission by duodenoscopes and challenges that may delay the transition to these designs and technologies. The meeting date will be available in the FDA Advisory Committee when available. The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

{"title": "Statement from Sarah Yim, M.D., acting director of the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, on FDA’s continued progress facilitating competition in the biologic marketplace with approval of 25th biosimilar product", "date": "November 15, 2019", "contents": " Biological products play an increasingly central role in modern medicine, offering treatments for many serious illnesses. Commonly referred to as biologics, these medicines are generally made from natural or living sources, like animal and plant cells, and microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast, and developed using advanced science. They are usually more complex than other drugs and are particularly critical in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Historically, biologics lacked effective competition in the marketplace because there was no abbreviated FDA review pathway for bringing “follow-on” versions of biologics to market. That changed when Congress gave FDA the authority to implement an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products in 2010. This pathway provides for the agency’s review and approval of biosimilar products, which may offer more access to treatments and lower costs for patients. A biosimilar product is highly similar to, and has no clinically meaningful differences from, an existing FDA-approved biologic product, called the reference product. Our ability to support a market for safe, effective biosimilar products is key for patients and our nation’s health care system. Today the FDA took another step to further foster biologics competition with the approval of , a biosimilar to Humira. Today’s approval is one of nine new biosimilar products the FDA has taken action on in 2019, bringing the overall total of biosimilar approvals to 25. I’m pleased to see this progress and am confident that the market for these therapies will continue to grow. To date, 74 programs for 38 different reference products have been enrolled in our to discuss development of proposed biosimilar products or interchangeable products, laying the foundation for ongoing competition in the marketplace. Importantly, health care professionals and patients when using an FDA-approved biosimilar product. Biosimilar products approved by the FDA undergo a rigorous evaluation to determine that they meet the requirements for licensure and are manufactured under the same quality standards as brand name medicines. We are also continuing the agency’s work under the to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process. This includes efforts to develop and implement new biosimilar-specific review templates and progress towards the development and validation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers tailored to biosimilar development. As outlined in this plan, we’re continuing to provide scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar development community, and at the same time, we are undertaking communication and outreach efforts for educating patients, clinicians and payors about biosimilars’ safety and effectiveness. Another important part of our work, at Congress’ direction, is facilitating the March 23, 2020, transition of approved marketing applications for biological products regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to be approved biologics license applications regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This means that these biological products, including products like insulin that are in great demand and have seen price increases, will be regulated under the PHS Act like other biological products and open to biosimilar competition. This, in turn, could lead to the development of more affordable biosimilar insulin products, including products that are interchangeable with branded insulins, without any compromise in safety and effectiveness. The FDA on the development of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products in May, and we are analyzing the comments we received from many different stakeholders, including those who are directly affected by the price of insulin and who would benefit from the impact of additional competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products. Our work in this area continues and is a high priority. The promise of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products in providing increased access to important therapies is great, and the FDA will continue to do all that we can to facilitate competition in this area.

This new approved indication for Calquence provides a new treatment option for patients with CLL or SLL as an initial or subsequent therapy. “Today, as part of a U.S., Australian and Canadian collaboration known as Project Orbis, the U.S. approved a new treatment option for those living with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The FDA’s Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drug applications among the FDA’s international partners,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “We are pleased to continue working alongside our Australian and Canadian colleagues to facilitate new treatment options for patients and the FDA looks forward to working with other countries in future application reviews.” CLL and SLL are similar cancers, but they occur in different areas of the body. CLL occurs mainly in the blood and bone marrow, while SLL occurs mainly in the lymph nodes. Both are cancers of lymphocytes, which are a type of immune cell that helps the body fight infection. Symptoms of CLL or SLL include low red blood cell counts (anemia), low platelet counts, fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes, and a higher risk of infection. The supplemental approval of Calquence for patients with CLL or SLL was based on two randomized clinical trials that compared Calquence to other standard treatments. The first clinical trial involved 535 patients with previously untreated CLL. Patients receiving Calquence had a longer progression-free survival (the amount of time a patient stays alive without the cancer growing) compared to patients receiving other standard treatments. The second clinical trial included 310 patients with previously treated CLL. Patients receiving Calquence also had a longer progression-free survival than patients receiving other standard treatments. The most common side effects of Calquence were anemia, neutropenia (abnormally low levels of white blood cells), upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia (abnormally low levels of platelets), headache, diarrhea and musculoskeletal pain (pain that affects the muscles and bones). Patients may experience atrial fibrillation and flutter and should be monitored for symptoms of arrhythmias (irregular heart beat). Patients may experience serious infections and should be monitored and treated promptly. Patients should also be monitored for bleeding and managed appropriately. Patients may also experience low blood counts and should have blood work monitored regularly. Patients should be advised to use sun protection as other malignancies, such as skin cancers and other solid tumors, have occurred in patients taking Calquence. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Calquence. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Calquence because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby, or cause delivery complications. In addition to the international collaboration with Australia and Canada, this review used the , which can streamline the submission of data prior to the completion and submission of the entire clinical application.

{"title": "Statement on the agency’s efforts to protect patients through postmarket drug safety surveillance practices", "date": "November 06, 2019", "contents": " Public health and safety is the highest priority at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We maintain a robust practice of postmarket surveillance and risk evaluation programs to identify new adverse events that did not appear during the product development process, or to learn more about known adverse events. Evaluations occur on more than two million adverse event reports submitted every year to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) through the MedWatch Program and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) by patients, family members, and health care providers, as well as adverse event reports submitted by regulated industry. Staff in our Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and CBER’s Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology use this information to identify safety concerns and recommend actions to improve product safety and protect the public. Recently, we’ve been working to enhance the efficiency of our postmarket drug safety surveillance practices. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to eliminate the requirement for FDA to prepare a summary analysis of adverse drug reaction reports received for a drug by 18 months following approval of the drug or after 10,000 individuals have used the drug, whichever occurs later. A 2016 agency to assess the impact of these analyses on our regulatory actions found that these assessments were largely redundant to the FDA’s current surveillance practices and were not an efficient use of agency resources. For example, many drugs and biologics for rare diseases never met the 10,000-individual use threshold. The Cures Act included a new requirement that the FDA make our best practices for drug safety surveillance publicly available on the web. Following the passage of the Cures Act we posted a announcing the risk-based principles we use for postmarket safety surveillance. Today, we’re announcing the availability of our draft document, “ ,” which expands upon those principles. This draft best practice document outlines our approach for timely postmarket analyses of drugs and biologics, and includes a high-level overview of tools, methods, and signal detection and evaluation activities, using varied data sources, for drug safety surveillance to provide a broader context and a general overview of our overarching effort and commitment in this area. For prompt signal detection and evaluation of safety concerns using a risk-based approach, our best practices document addresses how we take into consideration the product’s characteristics and use. For example, products that generally are subject to more extensive monitoring include: NDAs that are new molecular entities, original biological license applications, biosimilar biological products, first-in-class approvals, newly approved formulation(s), newly approved indication(s), extension into new patient populations, products with complex pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic characteristics, and products with complex compositions or manufacturing processes. FDA staff also monitor the safety of compounded products, even though they are not subject to FDA premarket review and approval, as well as homeopathic products. Our best practices document incorporates the guiding principle that postmarket safety surveillance is a dynamic and constantly evolving field. By using a risk-based approach, the FDA takes into account the nature of the drug, its potential adverse events, the intended population, and the potential for serious outcomes, as well as the impact on individuals and the overall potential impact on the health of the public. When information is uncovered that may change the benefit-risk profile of a product, we will investigate the issue and consider appropriate action, including labeling changes, issuing drug safety communications, requiring postmarketing studies or requiring a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Even when we do not have enough evidence to establish a causal association between a drug and adverse event, we continue monitoring the safety of the product. In addition to FDA’s surveillance, studies are important to patient safety and public health . We have been reporting the progress of postmarketing studies and holding companies accountable for completing these important studies on time to ensure that our understanding of a drug’s safety and efficacy keeps pace with its uses. As the agency continues to commit to its safety assessments, product sponsors must continue to do their part, and we will take appropriate action when requirements are missed. The FDA will continue to provide guidance and oversight to ensure product sponsor studies are carried out in a complete and timely manner. We are constantly seeking new methods for improving our surveillance practices, and we invite the public to comment on the draft document released today. Through new data systems, tools, applications and partnerships, we will continue our efforts and commitment to exploring new and updated approaches to postmarket safety surveillance of all drugs and biologic products as part of our uncompromising efforts to protect the American public and ensure the products they take are safe and effective.

{"title": "FDA approves first therapy to treat patients with rare blood disorder ", "date": "November 08, 2019", "contents": " Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to Reblozyl (luspatercept–aamt) for the treatment of anemia (lack of red blood cells) in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. “When patients receive multiple blood transfusions, there is a risk for iron overload, which can affect many organs,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval provides patients with a therapy that, for the first time, will help decrease the number of blood transfusions. This approval is an example of our continued progress for rare diseases and providing important new drugs to patients earlier.” Beta thalassemia, also called “Cooley’s anemia,” is an inherited blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. In people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body and anemia, which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue and more serious complications. Supportive treatment for people with beta thalassemia often consists of lifelong regimens of chronic blood transfusions for survival and treatment for iron overload due to the transfusions. People with beta thalassemia are also at an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. The approval of Reblozyl was based on the results of a clinical trial of 336 patients with beta thalassemia who required RBC transfusions, of which 112 received a placebo. Twenty-one percent of the patients who received Reblozyl achieved at least a 33% reduction in transfusions compared to 4.5% of the patients who received a placebo. The transfusion reduction meant that the patient needed fewer transfusions over 12 consecutive weeks while taking Reblozyl. Common side effects for patients taking Reblozyl were headache, bone pain, arthralgia (joint pain), fatigue, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients may experience hypertension while using Reblozyl. Health care professionals are advised to monitor a patient’s blood pressure during treatment and to initiate anti-hypertensive treatment if necessary. Patients who receive Reblozyl should be monitored for thrombosis (blood clots). The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Reblozyl. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Reblozyl because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The FDA granted this application designation. Reblozyl also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Reblozyl to Celegene Corporation.

{"title": "FDA authorizes marketing of first next-generation sequencing test for detecting HIV-1 drug resistance mutations", "date": "November 05, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a test to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type-1 drug resistance mutations using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay is the first HIV drug resistance assay that uses NGS technology that the FDA has authorized for marketing in the U.S. “The ability to rationally select treatments for patients about to start or already taking antiviral therapy provides another tool in our ongoing fight against HIV” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Today’s authorization offers health care providers a new tool in helping to select treatment options for their patients. The right combination of antivirals can lower viral loads, or the amount of virus in the blood stream, and help keep patients with HIV healthy for many years. However, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the percentage of people living with HIV around the world that have resistance to some HIV drugs has increased from 11% to 29% since 2001. Today’s authorization can help health care providers better tailor drug treatment for patients who are beginning antiviral therapy and also for those who have developed resistance to HIV drugs by helping to identify mutations in the HIV-1 virus that can impact the effectiveness of certain drugs.” When untreated, HIV infection can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is transmitted through direct contact with HIV-infected bodily fluids such as blood, and the majority of HIV infections in the U.S. are from HIV-1. According to the CDC, there were more than 1 million Americans living with HIV in 2016. The current standard of care for patients with HIV-1 is antiretroviral therapy, also known as ART, the daily use of a combination of drugs to treat HIV by suppressing the virus. According to the National Institutes of Health, it is a lifesaving treatment that can let patients with HIV lead long and healthy lives but it is not a cure. Traditionally, monitoring a patient’s viral load has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. Increasing viral loads indicate that the virus may have mutated and that a patient’s current regimen is no longer effective at suppressing the virus. Once the virus has mutated and drug resistance develops, a person generally must change medications as different drugs will be needed to keep the virus from multiplying. “As a public health agency, the FDA is keenly aware of the threat of drug resistant infections and we’re focused on facilitating the development of safe and effective new treatments to give patients more options to fight life-threatening infections,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “This diagnostic provides a new way to select effective treatment options. The FDA remains committed to helping to make available to Americans more innovative medical products that help us face the challenges of managing HIV infection.” The Sentosa SQ HIV-1 Genotyping Assay detects HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in patients taking or about to start antiviral therapy. This assay detects mutations in genes of the HIV-1 virus from a sample of a patient’s blood using NGS. Understanding the mutations in the virus can help healthcare providers select an effective combination of drugs in an ART regimen and indicate which drugs may no longer be effective against the mutated HIV-1 virus. The FDA reviewed data from performance studies, which demonstrated a greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity in detecting 342 HIV drug resistant mutations and determined the Sentosa SQ HIV-1 Genotyping Assay provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for its intended use. The Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay is for use only in patients with HIV-1 who are about to start or already taking antiviral therapy and is not intended for diagnosing infection with HIV. Results of this test are intended to be used in conjunction with clinical observations, patient history and other laboratory evidence to make patient management decisions. The FDA reviewed data for the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, the requirements that test developers must meet for demonstrating accuracy, reliability and effectiveness of tests intended to identify virus mutations. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay to Vela Diagnostics USA Inc.

{"title": "Statement on the agency’s continued efforts to protect women’s health and enhance safety information available to patients considering breast implants", "date": "October 23, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is taking another significant step in protecting women’s health by helping to ensure patients have complete information about the benefits and risks of breast implants. In a issued today, we are providing proposed labeling recommendations to manufacturers of these devices to help ensure women receive and understand information regarding the benefits and risks of breast implants. The draft guidance offers numerous recommendations to help ensure women have access to this information, including that manufacturers incorporate a boxed warning and patient decision checklist in the device’s labeling, update recommendations for patient screening for device rupture and more. We’ve heard loud and clear from the we held earlier this year and from the information we’ve gathered from other ongoing efforts to engage with patients and stakeholders that there is a distinct opportunity to do more to protect women who are considering breast implants. We believe women should have thoughtful and balanced discussions with their health care providers about both the benefits and risks of breast implants based on clear and current information. This draft guidance is an important step in making that happen. We have heard from many women that they are not fully informed of the risks when considering breast implants. They’ve stated that they need more information to facilitate meaningful conversations with their doctors and to make appropriate decisions for themselves. Many stakeholders suggested that a boxed warning and patient decision checklist could provide this information. The agency appreciates this important feedback and, in today’s draft guidance, has proposed a number of recommendations designed to help inform conversations between patients and health care professionals when breast implants are being considered. First, we’re proposing that a boxed warning be included in labeling for breast implants. A boxed warning generally will be noticeable and easy to read and understand. The boxed warning should help communicate risks that patients may not know. We recommend that manufacturers identify certain risks in the boxed warning, including that breast implants are not lifetime devices; the chances of developing complications increase the longer a patient has the implant and additional surgery may be required to address the complications; and that breast implants have been associated with the risk of developing breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and may be associated with systemic symptoms (like fatigue or joint pain). Calling out this information in a boxed warning will help ensure patients see this important information. Additionally, the draft guidance recommends that manufacturers include a patient decision checklist at the end of a patient informational booklet or brochure. A patient decision checklist can be used to help guide discussion during a patient’s consultation with a surgeon. A checklist gives patients the opportunity to acknowledge individual risks of breast implants, such as potential risks from the surgery, the risk of BIA-ALCL and risk of implant rupture, among others. An example of a checklist that incorporates these recommendations is provided in the draft guidance and encourages patients to ask their surgeon about the surgeon’s experience, education, training and credentials. We believe the information contained in the example of the patient decision checklist can contribute to a patient’s understanding of both the benefits and risks of breast implants. Another recommendation described in the draft guidance focuses on revising the rupture screening recommendations for patients with silicone gel-filled breast implants. , the FDA recommended that labeling include the method(s) and frequency of screening for rupture, and current approved labeling recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screenings for patients beginning three years following implantation and every other year thereafter. The new recommendations issued in draft today propose that patients without symptoms be screened using either ultrasound or MRI at five to six years following implantation and then every two years thereafter. If a patient has symptoms at any time or uncertain ultrasound results for breast implant rupture, an MRI is recommended. These new proposed screening recommendations are based on data showing rupture rates are higher five to six years after implantation, recommendations from the American College of Radiology, recommendations from the FDA panel meeting earlier this year, data suggesting that ultrasound is an effective screening method for asymptomatic patients and our awareness of poor patient compliance with the existing MRI recommendations. By proposing updates to the recommendations based on current science and other information, the FDA hopes to make it easier for patients to comply with these new recommendations. The draft guidance also includes a recommendation that breast implant manufacturers include product ingredient information in the device’s labeling in a way that is easy for patients to understand, as we first suggested in a released in May. Although this information is currently publicly available online in the for each of the approved breast implants, we’re recommending that product ingredient information be included in the patient labeling in a format that is easy to understand to increase patient access to this information. The FDA believes that improved access to this descriptive information will help better inform patients of the types and quantities of chemicals and heavy metals that are in breast implants. Improved transparency can also improve patient safety. Finally, the draft guidance includes updates to previous recommendations concerning patient device cards. In , the FDA recommended that manufacturers provide patients, following surgery, with a device card that includes information about style, size and serial number of the product. In today’s draft guidance, we’re proposing that manufacturers include more information on the device card, including the of the product, the boxed warning, and also provide web links to the patient decision checklist, boxed warning and labeling for the specific implant so that patients may easily access any updated information on the manufacturer’s website. We believe including this information in an easy to access format will serve as an additional way to ensure women have as much information as possible to make informed decisions. Taken as a whole we believe this draft guidance, when final, will result in better labeling for breast implants that will ultimately help patients better understand breast implant benefits and risks, which is a critical piece in making health care decisions that fit patients’ needs and lifestyle. After a period of public comment, once the guidance is finalized, manufacturers may choose to follow the recommendations in the final guidance or they may choose other methods of labeling their devices, so long as the labeling complies with applicable FDA laws and regulations. This draft guidance is just one of several steps we are taking to help  women considering breast implants, including issuing to breast implant manufacturers regarding concerns with their required post-approval studies, convening the panel meeting earlier this year to discuss breast implant safety, and, most recently, requesting that one manufacturer recall its textured breast implant devices from the market due to the risk of BIA-ALCL. Our actions reflect the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of device safety, including device therapies unique to women. We look forward to continuing to engage with patients, manufacturers, the medical community and other stakeholders on these draft recommendations. The draft guidance is available for public comment. Information on how to submit comments is available in the The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The warning letter outlines multiple violations of current good manufacturing practices at contract manufacturers used to produce Dollar Tree’s OTC drugs as well as other drug products sold at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. “Protecting patient health and safety is our highest priority, and the FDA continues to investigate and take action against companies that place U.S. patients at risk. Americans expect and deserve drugs that are safe, effective and that meet our standards for quality. The importation and distribution of drugs and other products from manufacturers that violate federal law is unacceptable,” said Donald D.

{"title": "FDA approves therapy to treat patients with relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma supported by clinical trial results showing high response rate of tumor shrinkage", "date": "November 14, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy. “Mantle cell lymphoma usually responds well to initial treatment, but eventually returns or stops responding, and the cancer cells continue to grow. This is a life-threatening condition,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Clinical trials showed that 84% of patients saw tumor shrinkage with this therapy. For patients whose disease relapses or becomes refractory, secondary therapies may be successful in providing another remission, and today’s approval will provide patients with another treatment option.” Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma representing 3-10% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas in the United States. By the time it is diagnosed, mantle cell lymphoma has usually spread to the lymph nodes, bone marrow and other organs. In relapsed lymphoma, the disease reappears or grows again after a period of remission, while in refractory lymphoma, the disease does not respond to treatment or responds only briefly. A single-arm clinical trial of Brukinsa included 86 patients with mantle cell lymphoma who had received at least one prior treatment. The trial measured how many patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors after treatment (overall response rate). In the trial, 84% of patients had tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response (time between the initial response to therapy and subsequent disease progression or relapse) of 19.5 months. This trial was supported by an additional single-arm trial that included 32 patients, in which 84% of patients had tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response of 18.5 months. Common side effects for patients taking Brukinsa were decreased neutrophil count (white blood cells that fight against infection), decreased platelet count (a component of blood whose function is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, initiating a blood clot), upper respiratory tract infection, decreased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), rash, bruising, diarrhea and cough. During treatment, patients should be monitored for hemorrhage (bleeding), signs and symptoms of infection, cytopenias (decreased complete blood counts) and cardiac arrhythmias (irregular, rapid heart rate and abnormality in beating of the heart). Patients are advised to use sun protection if taking this therapy because there is a risk of other malignancies occurring including skin cancers. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Brukinsa. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Brukinsa because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Brukinsa was granted , which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on a result that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials may be required to verify and describe Brukinsa’s clinical benefit. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Brukinsa also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Brukinsa to BeiGene USA Inc.

{"title": "Statement on the agency’s efforts to protect patients from potentially harmful drugs sold as homeopathic products", "date": "October 24, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes that consumers may use various types of unapproved drugs, such as homeopathic drug , to treat or relieve different diseases and conditions. These products are often marketed as natural alternatives to approved prescription and nonprescription products and are widely available in the marketplace. Homeopathic products, however, are marketed without FDA review and may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness, quality and labeling. FDA uses a risk-based approach to monitor these products and to evaluate reports of adverse effects. Homeopathy is an alternative medical practice developed in the late 1700s that is based on the principle that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in diluted form to treat symptoms and illnesses, also known as “like cures like.” Homeopathic drug products are made from a wide range of substances, including ingredients derived from plants, healthy or diseased animal or human sources, minerals and chemicals, including known poisons. These products have the potential to cause significant and even permanent harm if they are poorly manufactured, since that could lead to contaminated products or products that have potentially toxic ingredients at higher levels than are labeled and/or safe, or if they are marketed as substitute treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions, or to vulnerable populations. In addition, some products may be labeled as homeopathic that do not conform to traditional homeopathic principles. As the homeopathy industry continues to grow at a rapid pace, we want to clarify for both consumers and industry how we assess the potential safety risks of these products. That’s why in 2017, the FDA issued a draft guidance discussing our, risk-based enforcement approach to drug products labeled as homeopathic. Today, we are taking two new steps toward clarifying this approach. First, we have to provide further information around our approach and are asking for public input on the revised draft. The draft guidance details a risk-based enforcement policy prioritizing certain categories of homeopathic products that could pose a higher risk to public health, including products with particular ingredients and routes of administration, products for vulnerable populations, and products with significant quality issues. We encourage the public to review this revised draft guidance and comment before it is finalized. We will consider feedback gathered through this new public comment period, the more than 4,500 comments interested stakeholders submitted on the original 2017 draft guidance, and information gleaned from a 2015 public hearing on the current use of homeopathic drug products. When finalized, this guidance will help provide transparency regarding the categories of homeopathic drug products that we intend to prioritize under our risk-based enforcement approach. Second, the agency is the Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400, entitled “Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed.” Risk is an important driver of the FDA’s regulatory and enforcement actions for all drug products, including homeopathic drug products. Since the issuance of CPG 400.400 in 1988, the FDA has encountered multiple situations in which homeopathic drug products posed a significant risk to patients, even though the products, as labeled, appeared to meet the conditions described in CPG 400.400. However, CPG 400.400 is inconsistent with our risk-based approach to regulatory and enforcement action generally and therefore does not reflect our current thinking. Therefore, it is appropriate to withdraw CPG 400.400 at this time. Today’s efforts are a continuation of the FDA’s long-standing work to protect Americans from potentially harmful products that are labeled as homeopathic. For example, the FDA has issued warning letters to companies who produce homeopathic drug products for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and various other violations. So far in 2019, we’ve issued more than 10 warning letters to companies for violations concerning homeopathic products. Recently, we issued warning letters to , which had jointly manufactured and packaged eye drops produced in non-sterile conditions which could result in serious eye infections. These warning letters should alert all companies that homeopathic drug products must be manufactured and labeled in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and agency regulations. The FDA is committed to a risk-based approach to homeopathic drug products, and we’ll continue taking appropriate regulatory and enforcement actions when we believe patients are being put at risk. In the meantime, we continue to encourage healthcare professionals and consumers to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of any homeopathic drug products to the The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Statement on agency’s first year accomplishments implementing SUPPORT Act authorities to address the opioids crisis", "date": "October 24, 2019", "contents": " Addressing the opioid crisis continues to be one of the FDA’s top public health priorities. While it is encouraging to see that, according to provisional data, total drug overdose deaths in the United States dropped 5.1% from 2017 to 2018 – the first decrease in more than two decades – we still have much work to do as deaths from drug overdoses remain at historically high levels. One focus of the FDA’s work over the past year has been implementing the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ( ), bipartisan legislation passed on October 24, 2018, which provided the agency new authorities to advance our efforts to confront the opioid crisis. On this one-year anniversary, I am pleased to share that we have taken the following actions to fulfill the requirements of various sections of the SUPPORT Act: Additionally, with the authorities provided by the SUPPORT Act, the FDA is taking new steps to promote the development of drugs to treat pain that are not addictive. To advance these goals, we are developing draft guidances addressing important issues related to the development of non-opioid drugs for use in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We are also considering whether to use the new SUPPORT Act authority over packaging and disposal to require that opioids be dispensed with disposal technologies (such as mail-back pouches) to help get unused medications out of medicine cabinets. The FDA is actively revising our regulatory procedures to implement new authority provided by the SUPPORT Act to issue a mandatory recall for any controlled substance if there is a reasonable likelihood that the drug would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. While we are proud of these accomplishments, we know that there is still more to do. We will continue to implement the SUPPORT Act to build upon our efforts and adapt our responses to confront the changing nature of the opioid crisis. The FDA remains committed to addressing this national crisis on all fronts, with a continued focus on decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; supporting the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies; and taking action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioid products. The agency will continue to use its regulatory authority to address this crisis, and the additional tools that the SUPPORT Act provides are helping us accomplish this vital work. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. Opioid analgesic sparing includes using non-opioid drugs to provide analgesia (pain relief) that would otherwise be provided with opioids. This can reduce patient exposure to opioids as well as the number of leftover opioids available for abuse or misuse in the community. To gain input on this issue, the agency held an to discuss the assessment of opioid analgesic sparing outcomes in clinical trials of acute pain. In addition, the FDA issued the , which describes the application of the benefit-risk assessment framework that the agency uses in evaluating applications for opioid analgesic drugs and summarizes the information that can be supplied by opioid analgesic drug applicants to assist the agency with its benefit-risk assessment. The guidance makes clear that the FDA considers the broader public health effects of these products as part of its benefit-risk assessment. The FDA also held a to gain feedback on, and further discuss, the agency’s benefit-risk assessment of opioid analgesics, including the manner in which risks of misuse and abuse of these products factor into that assessment. The agency also requested input on potential new preapproval incentives aimed at fostering the development of new therapies to treat pain or addiction. The FDA is working to submit a report to Congress on how the agency will utilize evidence-based opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines to protect the public health and a description of the public health need with respect to each such indication-specific treatment guideline. To inform the development of evidence-based guidelines that support more appropriate prescribing practices, the FDA a contract to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to help advance the development of such guidelines. We expect to receive NASEM’s report in early 2020. The FDA, in coordination with CBP and the U.S. Postal Service, submitted a report to Congress on enhancements to improve the screening of parcels at international mail facilities (IMFs), including facility upgrades, improved capacity and innovative technology. The FDA and CBP signed a Letter of Intent to establish an outline of strategies for advanced collaboration between the agencies that will be carried out through a series of separate written agreements. These agreements are expected to include procedures to enhance information sharing and operations, including the establishment of a list of controlled substances that are imported via international mail and which agency will retain primary interdiction responsibility. Three FDA/CBP work groups to implement the Letter of Intent have been established in the following areas: Collaboration at Ports of Entry, On-Site Laboratory and Scientific Services, and Shared Facilities and Space at the IMFs. Since implementation of the law, the FDA has identified more than 9,800 products processed through all IMFs as drugs because they contain an ingredient which presents a significant public health concern. Of these, more than 9,000 drugs have either been refused and destroyed or are being processed for administrative destruction, reflecting a 92% destruction rate for these products. The FDA also submitted a report to Congress about the list of controlled substances that the agency will refer to CBP for disposition under the Controlled Substances Act. Additionally, the FDA has issued several notices of debarment for a felony conviction involving the illegal importation of a drug. The first debarment order is currently being processed under this new authority. The FDA opened a to solicit feedback on potentially requiring that certain immediate-release opioid analgesics be made available in fixed-quantity, unit-of-use blister packaging. This could reduce the amount of unused opioid analgesics, reducing opportunities for misuse and abuse by patients and others. The agency is currently evaluating the public comments submitted to the docket and gathering additional stakeholder input to determine next steps. The agency issued the revised draft guidance, . The SUPPORT Act required the issuance of guidance regarding the circumstances under which the FDA may require postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess the potential reduction in effectiveness of a drug and how such reduction in effectiveness could result in a change to the benefits of the drug and the risks to the patient. This revised draft guidance addresses these topics, among other things, and further provides examples of when a postmarketing study or clinical trial may be required to further assess whether a potential failure of expected pharmacological action, including reduced effectiveness, may result in a serious adverse drug experience. The FDA, in coordination with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is working to submit a report to Congress on the adequacy of access to abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) of opioid analgesics under Medicare and the effectiveness of ADFs in reducing abuse and misuse."},
{"title": "Statement on efforts to help make development of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products more efficient", "date": "November 25, 2019", "contents": " Access to affordable insulin can be a matter of life and death for Americans with diabetes. If not appropriately treated, diabetes can lead to serious and life-threatening complications, including heart disease, organ failure and blindness. And consistent, lifelong access to insulin is imperative to patient survival and quality of life. However, we are aware that the high cost of insulin raises serious concerns about the ability of many patients to access insulin products. This is an issue the FDA takes very seriously; therefore, today we are announcing new draft guidance that is intended to help facilitate the development of, and improve patient access to, life-saving insulin products. The FDA is committed to continuing our efforts to help increase market competition among insulin products, which may potentially lower costs for patients and payors and increase access and product choice. This includes facilitating the development of safe and effective insulin products for the treatment of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, including products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an approved insulin product. To inform product developers who intend to seek the FDA’s approval of proposed insulin products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an approved insulin product, the FDA today issued a draft guidance for industry, “ .” This draft guidance is intended to help guide efficient product development by clarifying what data and information may – or may not – be needed to support a demonstration of biosimilarity or interchangeability for a proposed insulin product, as defined in the draft guidance. The draft guidance reflects, among other things, the FDA’s decades of experience with insulin products which, along with wide clinical use, has contributed to a robust scientific understanding of these products. The draft guidance also reflects consideration of stakeholder feedback provided at the FDA’s on this topic at which stakeholders were invited to provide input on developing biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. Significantly, the FDA recommends in the draft guidance that, under certain circumstances, a comparative clinical immunogenicity study would not be necessary for approval of certain proposed biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. In general, immunogenicity studies investigate the presence of an immune response to the therapeutic protein and its clinical impact, which can influence whether the therapy will work well and be safe. In the circumstances described in the draft guidance, the FDA generally expects the risk of clinical impact from immunogenicity to be minimal for certain proposed biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. As such, while applications for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products would be expected to include an immunogenicity assessment, that assessment could include a scientific justification of why a comparative clinical study to assess immunogenicity is not necessary for that particular proposed insulin product. The recommendations described in the draft guidance, which reflects extensive multidisciplinary evaluation of scientific considerations, may result in a more efficient development program that could ultimately bring biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products to the market more quickly. Applications for proposed biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products need to meet strict statutory standards, and applicants will need to submit data and information sufficient to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability, including, among other things, a comparative clinical pharmacology study, adequate chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and a comprehensive and robust comparative analytical assessment. For some proposed biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products, a comparative clinical immunogenicity study may still be needed to address residual uncertainty regarding immunogenicity. For example, a comparative clinical immunogenicity study may be needed if there are differences in certain impurities or novel excipients, but that would be a case-by-case scientific determination in the context of individual applications. On March 23, 2020, approved New Drug Applications (NDAs) for biological products will be deemed to be licenses for the biological products (i.e., approved Biologics License Applications (BLAs)) under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. After an approved NDA for a biological product (such as an insulin product) is deemed to be an approved BLA, the product can be used as a “reference product” by an applicant seeking approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product. A reference product is the biological product, already approved by the FDA, against which a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product is compared. This will enable, for the first time, submission of applications for products that are proposed as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, the transition products. As such, the transition of insulin products from approved NDAs to deemed BLAs will open up those products to potential biosimilar and interchangeable competition. The availability of approved biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products is expected to increase access and reduce costs of insulin products, which millions of Americans take each day to maintain stable blood glucose. The FDA is working now, in advance of the March 23, 2020 transition, to build a solid regulatory foundation for the review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. The issuance of this draft guidance supports key goals in the , which aims to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process and to maximize scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar product development community. We’ve accomplished many of the projects outlined in the Biosimilars Action Plan, and we’re continuing our work on others to enhance patient access to needed medicines. The FDA will begin from the public on the draft guidance on Nov. 29. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for adults with partial-onset seizures", "date": "November 21, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved XCOPRI (cenobamate tablets) to treat partial-onset seizures in adults. “XCOPRI is a new option to treat adults with partial-onset seizures, which is an often difficult-to-control condition that can have a significant impact on patient quality of life,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Patients can have different responses to the various seizure medicines that are available. This approval provides an additional needed treatment option for people with this condition.” A seizure is a usually short episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can cause uncontrolled movements,  abnormal thinking or behavior, and abnormal sensations. Movements can be violent, and changes in consciousness can occur. Seizures occur when clusters of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain undergo uncontrolled activation. A partial-onset seizure begins in a limited area of the brain. The safety and efficacy of XCOPRI to treat partial-onset seizures was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that enrolled 655 adults. In these studies, patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization for an average of approximately 24 years and median seizure frequency of 8.5 seizures per 28 days during an 8-week baseline period. During the trials, doses of 100, 200, and 400 milligrams (mg) daily of XCOPRI reduced the percent of seizures per 28 days compared with the placebo group. The recommended maintenance dose of XCOPRI, following a titration (medication adjustment) period, is 200 mg daily; however, some patients may need an additional titration to 400 mg daily, the maximum recommended dose, based on their clinical response and tolerability. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported among patients taking XCOPRI. In the clinical trials, some patients experienced DRESS, and one patient died, when XCOPRI was titrated rapidly (weekly or faster titration). No cases of DRESS were reported in an open-label safety study of 1,339 epilepsy patients when XCOPRI was started at 12.5 mg per day and adjusted every two weeks; however, this finding does not show that the risk of DRESS is prevented by a slower titration. A higher percentage of patients who took XCOPRI also had a shortening of the QT interval (an assessment of certain electrical properties of the heart) of greater than twenty milliseconds compared to placebo. XCOPRI should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to cenobamate or any of the inactive ingredients in XCOPRI or Familial Short QT syndrome. QT shortening can be associated with ventricular fibrillation, a serious heart rhythm problem. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including XCOPRI, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients taking an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. XCOPRI may cause neurological adverse reactions, including somnolence (sleepiness) and fatigue, dizziness, trouble with walking and coordination, trouble with thinking, and visual changes. Patients should also be advised not to drive or operate machinery until the effect of XCOPRI is known. The most common side effects that patients in the clinical trials reported were somnolence (sleepiness), dizziness, fatigue, diplopia (double vision), and headaches. The FDA granted the approval of XCOPRI to SK Life Science Inc.

{"title": "Statement on new steps to advance innovation in medical device sterilization with ethylene oxide", "date": "November 25, 2019", "contents": " At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration we continue to closely monitor the supply chain effects of closures and potential closures of specific large-scale sterilization facilities that use a gas called to sterilize certain medical devices prior to their use. Ethylene oxide is used in the manufacturing processes for a variety of both medical and non-medical products. While potential impacts to the availability of sterile medical devices is a concern given their criticality to our health care system, we also recognize the value in reducing over-reliance on ethylene oxide in commercial operations, including for medical device sterilization. This is why, in addition to our ongoing , we’ve been advancing innovation in medical device sterilization techniques to reduce reliance on ethylene oxide. Today we’re announcing the next steps we’re taking in our ongoing efforts in medical device sterilization with ethylene oxide. This includes the selection results of our two new Innovation Challenges to  accelerate the development and review of sterilization technology innovations, as well as a recap and action items that came out of our recent public advisory committee meeting on how best to encourage innovation in medical device sterilization. Further, we’re also announcing a new pilot program for industry to expedite approvals of certain changes to ethylene oxide sterilization processes and facilities. As we’ve previously mentioned, the were intended to encourage ideas from academics, industry and others about novel solutions for improving sterilization processes. was to identify new sterilization methods and technologies that are alternatives to those that use ethylene oxide. was to identify strategies or technologies that can significantly reduce the amount of ethylene oxide used to sterilize devices. Today we are announcing the results of both of these challenges. We received 46 applications, from companies large and small, and after careful review have selected 11 applications. These applications run the gamut of innovative ideas and novel methods, including nitrogen dioxide sterilization, vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization, reduced sterilant concentration and use of ethylene oxide-flexible chamber technology to name a few examples. As a next step, we’ll work directly with these selected applicants to accelerate the development and review of innovative technologies for sterilization processes. We are also simultaneously moving forward on recommendations we received from our held earlier this month. It was a robust meeting where we discussed how best to encourage innovation in medical device sterilization with speakers from the FDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom and several other stakeholders and members of the public. The EPA spoke about its role to regulate the emission of ethylene oxide from industrial facilities, which could include manufacturing facilities as well as sterilization facilities. The FDA gave presentations on the agency’s role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all medical devices, including oversight of the sterility of medical devices, and our role in monitoring and addressing medical device shortages due to reduced supply of certain ethylene oxide sterilized medical devices. The FDA and EPA continue to engage on ethylene oxide concerns and facility closures. Invited speakers presented information to the advisory committee panel on the impact of contract sterilization on medical device supply chains, reducing ethylene oxide emissions for medical device sterilization, and alternative modalities for industrial sterilization with existing industrial infrastructure. Members of the public spoke about the adverse impact of the environmental release of ethylene oxide on communities surrounding ethylene oxide industrial facilities and the adverse impact of the loss of ethylene oxide sterilization on the supply of medical devices for patient care. The advisory panel agreed that all available avenues should be pursued to reduce ethylene oxide use. One recommendation we received at the advisory committee meeting is for device manufacturers to begin, as soon as possible, to reduce the amount of paper (such as the labeling and instructions for use manuals) that is included in a sterile device package. An ethylene oxide sterilized medical device must be sealed in a carefully designed gas-permeable package that enables the ethylene oxide gas to enter. When the sterilization load (i.e., all of the materials inserted into the sterilizer chamber with the device) includes a large amount of paper with the device, it hinders the ethylene oxide getting to the device and generally means that more ethylene oxide is required for effective sterilization. Therefore, the FDA is encouraging device manufacturers to move to electronic materials where feasible and safe for device users. We are currently engaging with medical device industry members to make this change. A second recommendation we received at the advisory committee meeting is that the FDA could help mitigate medical device shortages and advance medical device sterilization by expediting approvals of certain changes that medical device manufacturers make to ethylene oxide sterilization methods, processes and facilities. Before most sterile medical devices are on the market, the FDA reviews premarket submissions to determine if the sterility information is adequate (i.e., in accordance with internationally agreed upon voluntary consensus standards that the FDA recognizes). If a medical device manufacturer changes the method, process, or the facility identified in its original premarket approval (PMA) submission for sterilizing its devices, the manufacturer generally needs to submit a PMA supplement to the FDA for review and approval before they can make those changes. However, considering the recent sterilization facility closures and concerns about their impact on medical device availability, we recognize the need to facilitate timely process and site changes that may reduce the amount of ethylene oxide used and minimize the impact of supply interruptions. In an effort to expedite approvals of certain changes to ethylene oxide sterilization processes and facilities, today we are announcing, and asking for participation in, our . This voluntary program has two components – one pertaining to sterilization facilities and one for device manufacturers. First, under the pilot program sterilization facilities that sterilize single-use medical devices using fixed chamber ethylene oxide sterilization processes (in which the device is placed in a chamber and the ethylene oxide is injected) would submit a Master File to the FDA when making certain changes to the location of the sterilization facility (i.e. changes between sterilization sites), or when making certain changes to sterilization processes that utilize reduced ethylene oxide concentrations. The is a submission to the FDA that may be used in support of premarket submissions to provide confidential detailed information about establishments, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of medical devices. A Master File is a reference document that helps facilitate the sound scientific evaluation of devices and may be used when several applications are submitted for different products that may use a common material or process, such as the same sterilization method. Second, under this voluntary program, manufacturers and sponsors of Class III devices (generally devices that are high risk and/or life-supporting or life-sustaining) affected by changes made by a sterilization facility participating in the EtO Pilot Program (and within the scope of the program) can, upon FDA’s permission, reference the Master File submitted by their sterilization provider in a post approval report, rather than a PMA supplement. The pilot program is intended to provide expeditious review and feedback to sterilization facilities and PMA holders on Master File submissions used to support changes made to sterilization site and/or processes in a postapproval report. By facilitating more efficient review and feedback, this pilot program should also result in sterilization facilities using a reduced amount of ethylene oxide several months sooner than they otherwise would while still providing robust patient safeguards. Consequently, we believe this pilot program will allow more nimble response to sterilization site closures by more quickly approving sterilization site relocations and speeding up the implemention of sterilization methods that reduce the amount of ethylene oxide needed to sterilize PMA-approved medical devices. This could reduce the impact of ethylene oxide on the environment and on the public health while at the same time continuing to ensure patient access to safe medical devices. We look forward to seeing what the selected applicants of the innovation challenge do next as well as the outcome of our EtO Pilot Program. The FDA will continue in our steadfast commitment to develop solutions to avoid potential device shortages and encourage new, innovative ways to sterilize medical devices while reducing adverse impacts on the environment and on the public health.

{"title": "FDA authorizes first test to aid in newborn screening for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy", "date": "December 12, 2019", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of the first test to aid in newborn screening for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. “Diagnostics that can safely and effectively screen newborns can help health care professionals identify and discuss potential treatment options with parents and caregivers before symptoms or effects on a baby’s health may be noticeable,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This authorization reflects our commitment to fostering innovation in devices to help inform and provide options to patients and their caregivers. Early screening can help identify individuals who need additional follow up or treatment.” The GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit authorized today is intended to aid in screening newborns for DMD. Newborn screening is a series of tests to help health care professionals identify serious diseases and conditions shortly after birth. As part of this screening, a newborn screening card is used to collect a small amount of blood from a prick of an infant’s heel, sometimes called a heel stick. The collected, dried blood samples are used to test for a variety of diseases and conditions. While the number and type of diseases and conditions tested on each state’s newborn screening panel can vary, there has been a national effort to harmonize screening practices across state newborn screening programs in the U.S. As a result of the collaboration between the federal Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children and the American College of Medical Genetics, as well as governmental, non-governmental, advocacy and private partners, the was developed and adopted.  The RUSP is a for screening newborns that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends for states to screen as part of their state universal newborn screening programs. Today’s authorization of the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit enables laboratories to add this test to their newborn screening panel if they choose to do so, but this authorization does not signal a recommendation for DMD to be added to the RUSP as a condition for which newborn screening is recommended. The GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit is not intended for DMD diagnosis or for screening of other forms of muscular dystrophies. The GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit works by measuring the concentration of a type of protein called CK-MM, which is part of a group of proteins called creatine kinase. Creatine kinase is found in muscle tissue and CK-MM enters the blood stream in increased amounts when there is muscle damage. This test measures the levels of CK-MM from the dried blood samples collected from the prick of a newborn’s heel 24 to 48 hours after birth. Elevated levels of CK-MM detected by the kit may indicate presence of DMD. Results showing elevated CK-MM must be confirmed using other testing methods, such as muscle biopsies, genetic and other laboratory tests. DMD, while rare, is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. It is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The first symptoms are usually seen between 3 and 5 years of age and worsen over time. The disease often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition and primarily affects boys, but in rare cases it can affect girls. DMD occurs in about 1 in 3,600 male live-born infants worldwide. People with DMD progressively lose the ability to perform activities independently and often require use of a wheelchair by their early teens. As the disease progresses, life-threatening heart and respiratory conditions can occur. Patients typically succumb to the disease in their 20s or 30s; however, disease severity and life expectancy vary. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that early diagnosis could lead to more personalized care for each person living with muscular dystrophy and may give each of them a better chance to reach his or her full potential. The CDC has also found that there was an average of two and a half years between when a parent or caregiver noticed the first signs and symptoms of DMD, and when a diagnosis of DMD was made. The FDA reviewed the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit through the pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate risk devices of a new type. During this process, the FDA evaluated data from a clinical study of 3,041 newborns whose dried blood samples were tested for protein levels that are associated with DMD. In the study, the kit was able to accurately identify the four screened newborns that had DMD-causing genetic mutations.  The device manufacturer also tested 30 samples from newborns with clinically confirmed cases of DMD, all of which were correctly identified by the test. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that must be met for tests of this type, including certain design verification, design validation and labeling requirements. When met, these special controls, along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type, with the same intended use, may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Risks associated with use of the kit include false negative test results. As part of the clinical study, the device manufacturer performed genetic testing, an accepted method of diagnosing DMD, on 173 patient samples including a subset of patients identified as negative by the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit. Genetic testing on the negative samples did not identify any DMD-causing genetic variants, confirming the negative screening results by the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit to PerkinElmer.

The FDA takes our responsibility of protecting the public from unsafe food very seriously and is committed to providing the public with more information as it becomes available. Early on, based on test results provided by the Maryland Department of Health, our investigation pointed to farms in Salinas, California, as potential sources of contaminated romaine lettuce based on the initial, limited number of reported illnesses. The FDA, in partnership with the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, rapidly mobilized in November to concurrently deploy inspection teams to the farms identified through the initial traceback investigation. The on-site investigations at these farms included collecting a wide-variety of samples for lab testing, including water, soil, soil amendments, scat and swab samples. While the majority of these samples tested negative for the outbreak strain, final results are pending and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services recently reported that it had isolated E. coli O157:H7 from a of pre-washed, chopped romaine lettuce. The FDA has also been tracking two additional and separate outbreaks of Earlier this week, the FDA, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced an outbreak linked to . To date, the CDC reported eight confirmed cases in the U.S. across three states associated with this cluster of illnesses.The also reports 24 cases in six Canadian provinces. Concurrently, the FDA has been working with health officials in Washington State regarding an O157:H7 associated with romaine consumption at a local restaurant chain. Washington State officials reported 10 confirmed and three probable cases in this outbreak with all reports of exposure in early to mid-November. It should be noted; these are currently being considered as three separate outbreaks caused by three different strains of Because of the expansive nature of these outbreaks, our investigation remains a complicated work in progress, and it is too soon to draw definitive conclusions. The FDA, CDC and our state partners have identified a common grower between each of the outbreaks, which is a notable development. This finding reinforces our earlier traceback results. It’s still too early to conclusively determine whether other sources may have also been involved in the outbreaks. However, progress is being made, and the FDA is actively investigating other traceback leads identified to determine if we can triangulate a more precise location of the contamination. We will provide updates to the public as further information becomes available. While our outbreak investigation remains a high priority for the agency, the progress made to this point is only possible due to three major factors. The first is the ability for federal agencies and the states to detect and link cases of foodborne illness through new DNA-fingerprinting capabilities referred to as Whole Genome Sequencing. This technology allows us to make connections earlier and to help prevent additional illnesses, ultimately saving lives. Second, strong federal and state coordination on matters of public health are critical in this work. In both isolating the outbreak strain in food samples and assisting in providing traceback records, our state partners’ work is exemplary and has proven critical to this investigation, and we continue to work to strengthen these vital public health partnerships. Finally, the voluntary adoption of labeling best practices by many and technology-enabled traceability used by some in the industry help to target consumer advice to a defined growing region – compared to last year’s advisory which was to avoid romaine lettuce nationwide regardless of where it was grown. While progress has been made, conducting traceback investigations into many segments of the produce industry remains challenging, as it involves digging into past records to work backward from case-patients to the point of purchase of the product, and then through the supply chain to the source from where it was grown. Traceback investigations are resource and time-intensive, and largely done the same way we have been conducting them for years. Since it is common for people who become ill from a leafy green like romaine lettuce to eat the food frequently, a solid traceback investigation requires specific details about all the food exposures a person had prior to becoming sick. This means the critical elements of a successful traceback – identifying which exposures most likely led to illnesses, and which to trace back to – is complex. None of this work can begin until an illness is reported. Once the initial evidence is laid out, a traceback investigation includes investigating retail establishments, suppliers and distributors working our way back to the farm or farms that may have grown the lettuce that ended up in consumers’ meals and homes. It’s a labor-intensive task requiring collecting and evaluating thousands of records while also trying to accurately document how the contaminated lettuce moved through the food supply chain to grocery stores, restaurants and other locations where it was sold or served. With the current outbreak investigations, the FDA worked quickly with romaine producers, distributors, retailers and foodservice companies to request that they promptly and voluntarily withdraw the product from the market in an attempt to contain these outbreaks. We have also conducted a to monitor romaine lettuce and will continue to do this through 2020. With technology and assignments like that just mentioned, the FDA is more forward-leaning than ever and will continue to get better at identifying potential outbreaks – and solving them. While we understand that millions of servings of fresh leafy greens are served safely every day to consumers, given the repeat nature of these outbreaks linked to leafy greens – and more specifically to romaine lettuce – it’s critical that everyone across the romaine supply chain do everything possible to fully understand why and how these outbreaks keep happening and continue to aggressively implement preventive measures to further protect consumers. The FDA’s continuing investigation of these outbreaks for products past their best-by dates, and even in fallow fields, is one of our efforts to find out how this contamination occurred so that the romaine growers can make interventions that will prevent future contamination and illnesses. As an agency, we remain laser-focused on prevention. Food safety is not a competitive issue, so everyone involved in the farm to table supply chain of fresh leafy greens (growers, distributors, retailers and foodservice companies) must work collaboratively, with a sense of urgency, and do everything possible to fully understand how and why these outbreaks continue to occur. Moreover, they must aggressively implement additional preventive measures to address any shortcomings identified to further protect consumers. While we as public health agencies have gotten better at detecting foodborne illnesses, our ability to trace back to the source of contaminated foods that may have caused the illnesses has lagged, due in part to the lack of modernized food traceability capabilities. Under the FDA’s , we plan to use advances in technology to improve our ability to track and trace products through the supply chain. We’ll be launching a New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint in early 2020 that will outline how we will advance our work in this area. This will help consumers get information more quickly, enabling people to better protect themselves and their families. We look forward to continuing our work with growers, processors, distributors and retailers in our shared efforts to protect consumers, and we will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA grants accelerated approval to first targeted treatment for rare Duchenne muscular dystrophy mutation", "date": "December 12, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted accelerated approval to Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) injection to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. It is estimated that about 8 percent of patients with DMD have this mutation. “The FDA recognizes the urgent need for new medical treatments for serious neurological disorders and we have a long-standing commitment to working with researchers, drug companies and patients to facilitate the development and approval of treatments for rare diseases. With today’s accelerated approval, patients with Duchenne — a rare and devastating disease — who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping will now have available the first treatment targeted specifically for this disease subtype,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., acting director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Use of the accelerated approval pathway will make Vyondys 53 available to patients based on initial data and we look forward to learning more about the drug’s clinical benefit from the ongoing confirmatory clinical trial.” DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of . DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The first symptoms are usually seen between three and five years of age and worsen over time. The disease often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition and primarily affects boys, but in rare cases it can affect girls. DMD occurs in about one out of every 3,600 male infants worldwide. People with DMD progressively lose the ability to perform activities independently and often require a wheelchair by their early teens. As the disease progresses, life-threatening heart and respiratory conditions can occur. Patients typically succumb to the disease in their 20s or 30s; however, disease severity and life expectancy vary. Vyondys 53 was approved under the accelerated approval pathway, which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and generally offer a meaningful advantage over existing treatments. Approval under this pathway can be based on adequate and well-controlled studies showing the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients (i.e., how patients feel or function or whether they survive). This pathway provides earlier patient access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. The accelerated approval of Vyondys 53 is based on the of an increase in dystrophin production in the skeletal muscle observed in some patients treated with the drug. The FDA has concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. A clinical benefit of the drug, including improved motor function, has not been established. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease and the lack of available therapy. Vyondys 53 was evaluated in a two-part clinical study. The first part included 12 DMD patients, with eight patients receiving Vyondys 53 and four receiving placebo. The second part of the study was open-label, and included the 12 patients enrolled in part one of the study, and 13 additional patients who had not previously received the treatment. In the study, dystrophin levels increased, on average, from 0.10% of normal at baseline to 1.02% of normal after 48 weeks of treatment with the drug or longer. As part of the accelerated approval process, the FDA is requiring the company to conduct a clinical trial to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The ongoing study is designed to assess whether Vyondys 53 improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA may initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. The most common side effects reported by participants receiving Vyondys 53 in clinical studies were headache, fever (pyrexia), cough, vomiting, abdominal pain, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis) and nausea. Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, fever, itching, hives, skin irritation (dermatitis) and skin peeling (exfoliation), have occurred in patients who were treated with Vyondys 53. Additionally, renal toxicity was observed in animals who received golodirsen. Although renal toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with Vyondys 53, renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal function should be monitored in patients taking Vyondys 53. The FDA granted this application designations. Vyondys 53 also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. In addition, the manufacturer received a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The FDA’s is intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics to prevent and treat rare diseases in children. Approval of Vyondys 53 was granted to Sarepta Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

{"title": "FDA authorizes first interoperable, automated insulin dosing controller designed to allow more choices for patients looking to customize their individual diabetes management device system", "date": "December 13, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today authorized marketing of the Tandem Diabetes Care Control-IQ Technology, an interoperable automated glycemic controller device that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to a person with diabetes by connecting to an alternate controller-enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) and integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM). This is the first such controller that can be used with other diabetes devices that are also designed to be integrated into a customizable diabetes management system for automated insulin delivery. This FDA authorization paves the way for iCGMs and ACE pumps to be used with an interoperable automated glycemic controller as a complete automated insulin dosing (AID) system. AID systems typically consist of a pump, CGM and software to control the system of compatible devices. “Today’s action continues the agency’s ongoing efforts to work with the diabetes community to help ensure the safety and efficacy of innovative and customizable diabetes management systems that may help patients better tailor their treatments to their individual needs,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The marketing authorization of this first stand-alone interoperable automated glycemic controller also allows substantially equivalent controller technologies that are developed for diabetes in the future to go through the 510(k) review process, helping to promote timely patient access to innovative technologies that can improve their care and quality of life.” Diabetes impairs the body’s ability to make or properly use the blood glucose-regulating hormone insulin and impacts nearly 10% of Americans. In type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes, the patient’s pancreas produces little or no insulin. Five percent of patients with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. The Control-IQ Technology controller is a new type of glycemic controller that when used as a system with compatible iCGMs and ACE pumps can be used by patients with type 1 diabetes to automatically increase, decrease and suspend delivery of basal insulin to the patient based on insulin delivery history, iCGM readings and predicted glucose values. The controller can also automatically deliver a specific amount of insulin when the glucose value is predicted to exceed a predefined amount. Other software to automatically control insulin delivery has previously been approved by the FDA as part of a single, predefined diabetes management system (as a class III, high-risk device). The Control-IQ Technology controller, which is designed to communicate with other compatible diabetes device components that are also designed to be integrated into a modular system, was reviewed through the , a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. The FDA reviewed data from a clinical trial of the Control-IQ Technology controller that included 168 participants with type 1 diabetes. Patients were randomized to use either the Control-IQ Technology controller installed on a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump, or a CGM and insulin pump without the Control-IQ Technology controller. The study demonstrated that the controller determines and commands safe and effective insulin delivery from a compatible ACE pump based on iCGM readings, with limited user intervention outside of mealtimes. The FDA also assessed the ability of the controller to communicate with all parts of the system with appropriate reliability, cybersecurity and fail-safe modes. Even though the system has been assessed for reliability, incorrect and inappropriate calculation, and command, delay of insulin delivery can still occur. Other risks associated with use of the interoperable controller can include incorrect insulin delivery as a result of loss of communication between connected devices, or from exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. These associated risks can lead to low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or high blood glucose (hyperglycemia, including diabetic ketoacidosis). Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, which outline specific regulatory requirements that, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. For this device, those controls include requirements related to reliability, device interoperability, cybersecurity, and clinical relevance. With the authorization of the interoperable Control-IQ Technology controller and the establishment of these special controls, the FDA has created a new regulatory classification for this type of device, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Control-IQ Technology controller to Tandem Diabetes Care Inc.

{"title": "FDA clears first fully disposable duodenoscope, eliminating the potential for infections caused by ineffective reprocessing  ", "date": "December 13, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing in the U.S. the first fully disposable duodenoscope. The EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope is intended to provide visualization and access to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract to treat bile duct disorders and other upper GI problems. “The availability of a fully disposable duodenoscope represents another major step forward for improving the safety of these devices, which are used in more than 500,000 procedures in the U.S. each year. Unlike duodenoscopes that are used on multiple patients, a fully disposable duodenoscope doesn’t need to be reprocessed, eliminating the risk of potential infection due to ineffective reprocessing,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Improving the safety of duodenoscopes is a top priority for the FDA since such devices remain critical to life-saving care for many patients, and the FDA continues to encourage innovative ways to improve the safety and effectiveness of these devices.” Duodenoscopes are used as a less invasive method than traditional surgery to drain fluids from pancreatic and biliary ducts blocked by cancerous tumors, gallstones or other gastrointestinal conditions. The flexible, lighted duodenoscope is threaded through the patient’s mouth and stomach to access the top of the small intestine. Traditionally, these devices have been intended for use on multiple patients, which has required these devices to be cleaned and disinfected (i.e. reprocessed) in between uses to reduce the potential for infection between patients. However, duodenoscopes are complex medical devices with many small working parts that can be difficult to clean. The device can trap contaminated tissue or fluid in its crevices and, if not thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, it can transmit infection-causing bacteria between patients. The EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope is intended for use on a single patient, therefore removing the potential risks associated with ineffective reprocessing. The FDA previously to health care facilities regarding risks associated with ineffective reprocessing of duodenoscopes that are used on multiple patients. In August, the FDA released a recommending that duodenoscope manufacturers and health care facilities transition to duodenoscopes with partially- or fully- disposable designs, which can simplify or eliminate the need for reprocessing of certain components, therefore reducing or eliminating between-patient duodenoscope contamination. The FDA previously cleared duodenoscopes with disposable endcap and elevator components. Today’s clearance is the first fully disposable duodenoscope device. Risks of using the EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope include the potential for injuries, such as, but not limited to, burns, electric shock, perforation, infection and bleeding. The EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope was granted designation, meaning the FDA provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development to expedite evidence generation and the agency’s review of the product. To qualify for such designation, a device must be intended to treat or diagnose a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition and meet one of the following criteria: the device must represent a breakthrough technology; there must be no approved or cleared alternatives; the device must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients. The EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope was reviewed through the premarket clearance (510(k)) pathway. A 510(k) notification is a premarket submission made by device manufacturers to the FDA to demonstrate how a new device is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to a legally marketed predicate device. As part of the premarket clearance process, the FDA reviews the information in the 510(k) submission to determine whether the device proposed to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The FDA granted clearance of the EXALT Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope to Boston Scientific Corporation.

{"title": "FDA approves new treatment for adults with migraine", "date": "December 23, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ubrelvy (ubrogepant) tablets for the acute (immediate) treatment of migraine with or without aura (a sensory phenomenon or visual disturbance) in adults. Ubrelvy is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. It is the first drug in the class of oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists approved for the acute treatment of migraine. “Migraine is an often disabling condition that affects an estimated 37 million people in the U.S.,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., acting director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Ubrelvy represents an important new option for the acute treatment of migraine in adults, as it is the first drug in its class approved for this indication. The FDA is pleased to approve a novel treatment for patients suffering from migraine and will continue to work with stakeholders to promote the development of new safe and effective migraine therapies.” Migraine headache pain is often described as an intense throbbing or pulsating pain in one area of the head. Additional symptoms include nausea and/or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Approximately one third of individuals who suffer from migraine also experience aura shortly before the migraine. An aura can appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines, or a temporary loss of vision. Migraines can often be triggered by various factors including stress, hormone changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep and diet. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men and affects more than 10% of people worldwide. The effectiveness of Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 1,439 adult patients with a history of migraine, with and without aura, received the approved doses of Ubrelvy to treat an ongoing migraine. In both studies, the percentages of patients achieving pain freedom two hours after treatment (defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain) and whose most bothersome migraine symptom (nausea, light sensitivity or sound sensitivity) stopped two hours after treatment were significantly greater among patients receiving Ubrelvy at all doses compared to those receiving placebo. Patients were allowed to take their usual acute treatment of migraine at least two hours after taking Ubrelvy. 23% of patients were taking a preventive medication for migraine. The most common side effects that patients in the clinical trials reported were nausea, tiredness and dry mouth. Ubrelvy is contraindicated for co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. The FDA granted the approval of Ubrelvy to Allergan USA, Inc.

{"title": "FDA approves first generics of Eliquis", "date": "December 23, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two applications for the first generics of Eliquis (apixaban) tablets to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is also indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. Additionally, apixaban is indicated for the treatment of DVT and PE and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy. “Today’s approvals of the first generics of apixaban are an example of how the FDA’s generic drug program improves access to lower-cost, safe and high-quality medicines,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “These approvals mark the first generic approvals of a direct oral anticoagulant. Direct oral anticoagulants (blood thinners) do not require repeated blood testing.” Addressing the challenges related to developing generics and promoting more generic competition is a key part of the FDA’s and the agency’s efforts to help increase patient access to more affordable medicines. For at-risk patients, such as those with, or at risk for, DVT, or nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke related to blood clots forming in the body and traveling to the brain is a serious concern. Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm problem that can potentially cause such blood clots. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that between 2.7 and 6.1 million people in the U.S. have atrial fibrillation. Many of these individuals use anticoagulants or anti-clotting drugs to reduce that risk. Apixaban will be dispensed with a Medication Guide for patients that provides instructions on its use and drug safety information. Health care professionals should counsel patients on signs and symptoms of possible bleeding. There is an increased risk of thrombotic events, which occur when blood clots form inside a blood vessel, or strokes if a patient stops using apixaban too early. Additionally, epidural or spinal hematomas (bleeding outside of blood vessels) may occur in patients treated with apixaban who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Health care professionals should consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Patients with prosthetic heart valves should not take apixaban. Apixaban was not studied in patients with atrial fibrillation caused by a heart valve problem. As with other FDA-approved anti-clotting drugs, bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most serious risk with apixaban.

{"title": "FDA finalizes enforcement policy on unauthorized flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes that appeal to children, including fruit and mint", "date": "January 02, 2020", "contents": " Amid the epidemic levels of youth use of e-cigarettes and the popularity of certain products among children, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today against certain unauthorized flavored e-cigarette products that appeal to kids, including fruit and mint flavors. Under this policy, companies that do not cease manufacture, distribution and sale of unauthorized flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes (other than tobacco or menthol) within 30 days risk FDA enforcement actions. “The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes. HHS is taking a comprehensive, aggressive approach to enforcing the law passed by Congress, under which no e-cigarettes are currently on the market legally,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “By prioritizing enforcement against the products that are most widely used by children, our action today seeks to strike the right public health balance by maintaining e-cigarettes as a potential off-ramp for adults using combustible tobacco while ensuring these products don’t provide an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for our youth. We will not stand idly by as this crisis among America’s youth grows and evolves, and we will continue monitoring the situation and take further actions as necessary.” “As we work to combat the troubling epidemic of youth e-cigarette use, the enforcement policy we’re issuing today confirms our commitment to dramatically limit children’s access to certain flavored e-cigarette products we know are so appealing to them – so-called cartridge-based products that are both easy to use and easily concealable. We will continue to use our full regulatory authority thoughtfully and thoroughly to tackle this alarming crisis that’s affecting children, families, schools and communities,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Coupled with the recently signed legislation increasing the minimum age of sale of tobacco to 21, we believe this policy balances the urgency with which we must address the public health threat of youth use of e-cigarette products with the potential role that e-cigarettes may play in helping adult smokers transition completely away from combustible tobacco to a potentially less risky form of nicotine delivery. While we expect that responsible members of industry will comply with premarket requirements, we’re ready to take action against any unauthorized e-cigarette products as outlined in our priorities. We’ll also closely monitor the use rates of all e-cigarette products and take additional steps to address youth use as necessary.” The final guidance outlining the agency’s enforcement priorities for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes and e-liquids, comes as the on e-cigarette use show that more than 5 million U.S. middle and high school students are current e-cigarette users (having used within the last 30 days) – with a majority reporting cartridge-based products as their usual brand. The NYTS survey, which is conducted annually by the FDA in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also shows that of current youth e-cigarette users in 2019, approximately 1.6 million were using the product frequently (use on 20 days or more in a 30-day period), with nearly one million using e-cigarettes daily. Additional data from further underscore that youth are particularly attracted to e-cigarette flavors such as fruit and mint, much more so than tobacco or menthol flavored e-cigarettes. These overall levels of youth e-cigarette use are particularly concerning because using e-cigarettes puts them at risk for nicotine addiction and other health consequences. In particular, evidence shows that youth exposure to nicotine can adversely affect the developing adolescent brain and that, compared with non-users, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try conventional cigarettes in the future. On Aug. 8, 2016, all e-cigarettes and other ENDS products became subject to the FDA’s tobacco authorities, including the premarket authorization requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). All e-cigarettes and other ENDS products on the market at that time needed to have authorization from the FDA to be legally marketed. However, as an exercise of its enforcement discretion, the agency had deferred enforcement of the premarket authorization requirements. To date, no ENDS products have been authorized by the FDA — meaning that all ENDS products currently on the market are considered illegally marketed and are subject to enforcement, at any time, in the FDA’s discretion. Beginning 30 days from the publication of the notice of availability of this guidance in the Federal Register, the FDA intends to prioritize enforcement against these illegally marketed ENDS products by focusing on the following groups of products that do not have premarket authorization: Cartridge-based ENDS products are a type of ENDS product that consists of, includes, or involves a cartridge or pod that holds liquid that is to be aerosolized when the product is used. For purposes of this policy, a cartridge or pod is any small, enclosed unit (sealed or unsealed) designed to fit within or operate as part of an ENDS product. By not prioritizing enforcement against other flavored ENDS products in the same way as flavored cartridge-based ENDS products, the FDA has attempted to balance the public health concerns related to youth use of ENDS products with considerations regarding addicted adult cigarette smokers who may try to use ENDS products to transition away from combustible tobacco products. In addition to data showing that cartridge-based ENDS products are most commonly used among youth, important findings from the focusing on youth use of JUUL indicate that youth preference for menthol- and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes is much lower than that for mint- and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. Because of the relatively low numbers of youth using both menthol- and tobacco-flavored, cartridge-based ENDS products, these products are not among the current enforcement priorities. However, should the FDA become aware of an increase of youth using any other flavored products (both cartridge-based or otherwise), the agency will take additional steps to address youth use of those products if necessary. For all other products (cartridge-based or otherwise), including menthol-, tobacco-, and non-flavored ENDS products, the FDA will also prioritize enforcement where the manufacturer fails to take adequate measures to prevent youth access. For example, the FDA will consider whether the manufacturer has implemented adequate programs to monitor retailer compliance with age-verification and sales restrictions or if it has established and enforced penalties against retailers that fail to comply with those programs. The agency also will consider whether the manufacturer uses adequate age-verification technology (or requires that retailers who sell its products use such technology) to prevent underage access to its website and to prevent underage sales through the internet. In addition, consideration will be given to whether the manufacturer limits (or requires retailers who sell its products to limit) the quantity of ENDS products that a customer may purchase within a given period of time. The FDA also intends to prioritize enforcement with respect to any ENDS products that are targeted to youth or likely to promote use of ENDS by youth. Examples include: products marketed with labeling and/or advertising that resemble kid-friendly foods and drinks such as juice boxes or kid-friendly cereal; products marketed directly to minors by promoting ease of concealing the product or disguising it as another product; and products marketed with characters designed to appeal to youth. Importantly, the FDA’s enforcement priorities are not a “ban” on flavored or cartridge-based ENDS. The FDA has already accepted and begun review of several premarket applications for flavored ENDS products through the pathway that Congress established in the Tobacco Control Act. Manufacturers that wish to market any ENDS product – including flavored e-cigarettes or e-liquids – are required by law to submit an application to the FDA that demonstrates that the product meets the applicable standard in the law, such as whether the product is appropriate for the protection of the public health. If a company can demonstrate to the FDA that a specific product meets the applicable standard set forth by Congress, including considering how the marketing of the product may affect youth initiation and use, then the FDA could authorize that product for sale. The guidance also states that, after May 12, 2020, the FDA intends to also prioritize enforcement against any ENDS products that continue to be sold and for which the manufacturers have not submitted a premarket application. For ENDS products other than those in the three groups described above, if premarket applications are submitted by that date, the FDA intends to continue to exercise enforcement discretion for up to one year pending FDA review of the applications, unless there is a negative action by the FDA on such application or the product is authorized to be marketed by the FDA. The FDA has demonstrated a deep commitment to taking steps to prevent youth from using and becoming addicted to any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes. This enforcement policy is an important step in the agency’s ongoing work to ensure these products are not marketed to, sold to, or used by kids, as outlined in the agency’s , including investing in public education to educate youth about the dangers of e-cigarette use, provide resources to educators, parents and community leaders to prevent youth use, as well as further explore how to help those kids who are already addicted to e-cigarettes quit.

{"title": "FDA approves use of drug to reduce risk of cardiovascular events in certain adult patient groups", "date": "December 13, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the use of Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) as an adjunctive (secondary) therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among adults with elevated triglyceride levels (a type of fat in the blood) of 150 milligrams per deciliter or higher. Patients must also have either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients are advised to continue physical activity and maintain a healthy diet. Vascepa is the first FDA approved drug to reduce cardiovascular risk among patients with elevated triglyceride levels as an add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy. Statins are drugs used to treat elevated cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. “The FDA recognizes there is a need for additional medical treatments for cardiovascular disease,” said John Sharretts, M.D., acting deputy director of the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval will give patients with elevated triglycerides and other important risk factors, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, an adjunctive treatment option that can help decrease their risk of cardiovascular events.” High levels of triglycerides can play a role in the hardening of arteries or thickening of the artery wall, which can increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke; however, the mechanisms of action that contribute to reduced cardiovascular events among patients taking Vascepa are not completely understood. Vascepa’s efficacy and safety were established in a study with 8,179 patients who were either 45 years and older with a documented history of coronary artery, cerebrovascular, carotid artery and peripheral artery disease, or 50 years and older with diabetes and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients who received Vascepa were significantly less likely to experience a cardiovascular event, such as a stroke or heart attack. Vascepa’s active ingredient is the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, derived from fish oil. Vascepa is taken orally. In clinical trials, Vascepa was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (irregular heart rhythms) requiring hospitalization. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Vascepa was also associated with an increased risk of bleeding events. The incidence of bleeding was higher among patients who were also taking other medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin at the same time. Patients with allergies to fish or shellfish should be advised about the potential for allergic reactions. They should discontinue treatment and seek medical attention if any allergic reactions occur. The most common side effects reported in the clinical trials for Vascepa were musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema (swelling of legs and hands), atrial fibrillation and arthralgia (joint pain). Vascepa was initially approved in 2012 for adults with severe triglyceride levels. This supplement application received . The FDA grants priority review to applications for drugs that, if approved, would improve the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions.

{"title": "Statement on low-cost biosimilar and interchangeable protein products", "date": "December 17, 2019", "contents": " Ensuring an efficient pathway to bring potentially lower-cost biosimilar and interchangeable protein products to market is key for expanding access to these products and increasing competition, ultimately helping American patients. In March 2020 most protein products that were approved as drug products (including every insulin currently on the market) will open up to biosimilar and interchangeable competition. However, “chemically synthesized polypeptides” are excluded from this transition, which means that a product that falls within this category won’t be able to come to market as a biosimilar or interchangeable product, but will have to come to the market under a different pathway. Such a product would also not be able to come to market through the generic drug pathway because the originator product will have been classified as a biologic, and will not be available for copying. This exclusion could hurt potential competition because it means that if a developer were to chemically synthesize a copy of a protein product (e.g., an insulin copy), the product would not be able to come to market through the abbreviated biosimilar or interchangeable pathway, but instead would have to submit a new drug application, which could be much more resource-intensive. Removing this exclusion will help patients because it provides the potential for chemically synthesized follow-on insulins and other protein products to come to market through more efficient abbreviated pathways, regardless of how they are manufactured. In addition to expanding access to lower-cost biosimilar and interchangeable protein products, removing this exclusion will help to promote potential innovation in manufacturing methods, which could lead to future efficiencies in manufacturing processes.

{"title": "FDA permits sale of two new reduced nicotine cigarettes through premarket tobacco product application pathway", "date": "December 17, 2019", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced it has authorized the marketing of two new tobacco products manufactured by 22nd Century Group Inc. –  Moonlight and Moonlight Menthol, which are combusted, filtered cigarettes that contain a reduced amount of nicotine compared to typical commercial cigarettes. Following a rigorous science-based review of the premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted by the company, the agency determined that authorizing these reduced nicotine products for sale in the U.S. is appropriate for the protection of the public health because of, among several key considerations, the potential to reduce nicotine dependence in addicted adult smokers, who may also benefit from decreasing nicotine exposure and cigarette consumption. The agency determined that non-smokers, including youth, are also unlikely to start using the products, and those who experiment are less likely to become addicted than people who experiment with conventional cigarettes. While today’s action permits the new tobacco products to be legally sold or distributed in the U.S., it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA-approved.” In its decision, the agency notes that the Moonlight and Moonlight Menthol cigarette products differ from conventional cigarettes in nicotine content only – the products share similar adverse health risks as conventional cigarettes. There are no safe tobacco products and those who do not use tobacco products should not start. “Conventional cigarettes are designed to create and sustain addiction to nicotine. In announcing the FDA’s comprehensive plan to regulate tobacco and nicotine in July 2017, we noted our commitment to taking actions that will allow more addicted smokers to reduce their dependence and decrease the likelihood that future generations will become addicted to cigarettes,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “Today’s authorization represents the first product to successfully demonstrate the potential for these types of tobacco products to help reduce nicotine dependence among addicted smokers. Still, we must remain vigilant to ensure that the products authorized today actually deliver on that promise for consumers. We’ll be closely monitoring how Moonlight and Moonlight Menthol are marketed and will take action as necessary if the company fails to comply with any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements or if there is a notable increase in the number of non-smokers, including youth, using these products.” , manufacturers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. Importantly, this includes youth. The agency’s evaluation includes reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives and health risks, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and labeled. On average, conventional cigarettes made in the U.S. contain tobacco with a nicotine content of 10 to 14 milligrams (mg) per cigarette. Cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, which at the low end may range from 0.4 to 7.4 mg per cigarette, have existed for decades, primarily for research use. Moonlight and Moonlight Menthol have nicotine content between 0.2 to 0.7 mg per cigarette. As part of the FDA’s scientific review, the agency considered whether smokers who switch to reduced nicotine cigarettes would either smoke more cigarettes or change the way they smoked, such as taking a bigger puff, in order to get the same level of nicotine they would have from smoking conventional cigarettes. Generally, the FDA determined that smokers of reduced nicotine cigarettes tend to actually decrease the number of cigarettes smoked per day and that they do not change the intensity of their puff or inhalation. In addition, though data is limited, the agency expects that non-smokers, including youth, are unlikely to start using the authorized products, and those that do experiment with the authorized products are unlikely to develop nicotine dependence. Since Moonlight and Moonlight Menthol meet the definition of a cigarette under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the company must adhere to existing restrictions for cigarettes under FDA regulations, as well as other federal laws that, among other things, prohibit television and radio advertising. In addition, to further limit youth access to the products and exposure to their advertising and promotion, the FDA is placing stringent restrictions on how the products are marketed – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including restrictions that prevent advertising from being targeted to youth. The agency has previously issued a providing its rationale for these types of postmarket requirements, which highlight important considerations for reviewing the company’s applications. With the authorization of these products, the FDA will evaluate new available data regarding real-world use of these products through postmarketing records and reports as required in the marketing order. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. The FDA may withdraw this marketing order if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of a product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health, such as if there is an uptake of the product by youth. Additionally, today’s action is not a decision on the separate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications that the company . The FDA is continuing its substantive review of the company’s MRTP applications, which includes, among other things, evaluating whether the modified risk advertising or labeling enables the public to comprehend the modified risk information and to understand its relative significance in the context of total health. The company would need to receive an MRTP order from the FDA before they could market a tobacco product with any implicit or explicit claims that, among other things, a product reduces exposure to a substance or that use of the product is less harmful or would reduce harm or the risk of disease associated with other commercially marketed tobacco products. If a company markets a tobacco product as an MRTP without authorization, the company would be in violation of the law and may face FDA advisory or enforcement actions.

{"title": "FDA Announces Collaborative Review of Scientific Evidence to Support Associations Between Genetic Information and Specific Medications", "date": "February 20, 2020", "contents": " Pharmacogenetic testing is a type of genetic test that in some instances can predict how a person will respond to specific medications. Thus, this type of testing offers promise for informing the selection or dosing of some medications for certain individuals. When there is sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between how a person’s genes may impact their metabolism of a drug or how they may respond to the drug, this information can be useful for health care providers. However, for many medications, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to support using pharmacogenetic test results to inform prescribing decisions. In a 2018 safety communication, we the public about the FDA’s concerns with firms offering genetic tests making claims about how to use the genetic test results to manage medication treatment that are not supported by recommendations in the FDA-approved drug labeling or other scientific evidence. Clinicians order tests to help them and their patients make better informed decisions. Such decisions, however, should be based on solid and reliable science. Decisions based on inaccurate information can result in patient harm because patients may not receive the most appropriate medication, may receive a medication that could be harmful or may receive a prescription for an inappropriate dose. All of these scenarios can create unnecessary delays and prevent patients from receiving the most timely and appropriate treatment. Patients and clinicians deserve better. Unfortunately, in the time since our safety communication was issued, some manufacturers of pharmacogenetic tests with claims not adequately supported by sound science have continued marketing their tests, including some for medications to treat seizures, mental illness and pain, including opioids. The FDA remains concerned with the safe use of these medications based on pharmacogenetic test reports that are not supported by sound science. Many pharmacogenetic tests are being offered as laboratory developed tests (LDTs). For many years, FDA has, in an exercise of enforcement discretion, generally not enforced applicable regulatory requirements for LDTs, such as premarket review. The FDA developed its existing approach to LDT enforcement decades ago, when the field of LDTs was much different, and often relied on simpler technologies in local settings. While the landscape of LDTs has changed, the agency’s oversight framework has remained the same. The FDA is committed to continuing to work with Congress on a broader legislative solution to the oversight of in vitro clinical tests generally (including LDTs), which would modernize our regulation of these tests. In the meantime, the FDA should not and cannot stand idly by when safety issues arise. Consistent with our mission to protect and promote public health, we believe it is important to take steps now to help ensure that claims being made for pharmacogenetic tests offered today are grounded in sound science to avoid inappropriate management of patients’ medications—and to do so through approaches that both protect patients and advance the development of analytically and clinically validated pharmacogenetic tests. Indeed, genetic testing can enhance patient management by improving the selection of medications or the dosage of a medication, tailoring the therapy to the patient—but only when it is based on sound science. That’s why today we are introducing a collaboration between the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research intended to provide the agency’s view of the state of the current science in pharmacogenetics. Our new includes a table that describes some of the gene-drug interactions for which we believe there is sufficient scientific evidence to support the described associations between certain genetic variants, or genetic variant-inferred phenotypes, and altered drug metabolism, and in certain cases, differential therapeutic effects, including differences in risks of adverse events. The table posted today includes certain established gene-drug interactions that appear in FDA-approved drug labeling. Recognizing, however, that not all supported gene-drug interactions may be found in current FDA labeling, the table also includes some additional gene-drug interactions that are consistent with the current FDA labeling and for which there is sufficient scientific evidence based on published literature. This literature-based scientific evidence is often used in support of the recommendations found in professional guidelines used by clinicians. The table is not complete, but we felt it is important to provide clinicians, patients and test developers with information now while we continue to review the scientific evidence, including the scientific evidence underlying various professional guidelines, such as those of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium. We anticipate updating this web-based resource periodically as the evidence evolves. Further, we’ve opened a and encourage all stakeholders to provide their feedback on specific pharmacogenetic associations that should or should not be included as the agency continues to update this table. Feedback should include supporting rationale and underlying evidence that supports the pharmacogenetic association. These data will be evaluated as we consider updates to the table. We are also exploring additional approaches for evaluating the evidence underlying gene-drug associations, such as participation in a to the ongoing evaluation of the evolving science, as part of our commitment to continue engaging with health care professional, guideline setting, patient and test developer groups. We will continue to communicate about the promise and potential of pharmacogenetic testing, and about when we have concerns regarding claims that are not supported by sufficient scientific evidence. We are committed to engaging with stakeholders as we work to protect patients while fostering the development of new and innovative diagnostics.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of the First Genetic Test to Aid in the Diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome", "date": "February 21, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today authorized marketing of the first test to detect a genetic condition known as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common known cause of inherited developmental delay and intellectual disability. The test is intended as an aid in diagnosing FXS and is to be used along with the evaluation of a patient’s family history and clinical signs and symptoms of FXS. Additionally, this test is intended for use in adults who may be carriers of genetic alterations in the gene associated with FXS, called the According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females in the U.S. have FXS, which is a genetic disorder caused by changes in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. A segment of the DNA in the gene, known as a CGG trinucleotide repeat, is repeated in excess on the X chromosome in individuals with this disorder. While some repetition of the CGG repeat is normal, a high number of repeats may indicate potential health risks. The AmplideX Fragile X Dx and Carrier Screen Kit uses blood specimens from patients to measure the number of repeats of the CGG segment in the gene. The test can determine whether a patient has a number of CGG repeats that is considered either normal, intermediate, premutation or full mutation. Individuals with a full mutation typically have FXS, which is associated with developmental delays, learning disabilities, social and behavioral issues, intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. Women with a premutation have an increased risk of having a child with FXS as compared to women without a premutation. The number of women who have the Fragile X premutation is believed to be approximately 1 in 150 women. Men with a premutation will pass the premutation to their daughters only. Individuals with normal or intermediate levels of repeated CGG segments are currently thought to be asymptomatic for FXS or other fragile X-associated disorders. In addition to aiding in the diagnosis of FXS and for carrier testing, this test can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of fragile X-associated disorders, including fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, which is a movement and cognitive disorder that typically occurs in adults over age 50, and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency, a condition that is characterized by reduced function of the ovaries. The AmplideX Fragile X Dx and Carrier Screen Kit is not intended for use in fetal diagnostic testing, the screening of eggs obtained for in-vitro fertilization prior to implantation, or stand‐alone diagnoses of FXS. The FDA reviewed data for this test through the , a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. During this process, the FDA evaluated data from specimens collected at three clinical sites to assess the accuracy of the test. The data demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of the test is greater than 95%. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that test developers must meet for tests of this type, including requirements relating to labeling and performance testing. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.

{"title": " FDA Takes New Steps to Increase the Safety of Laparoscopic Power Morcellators when used in Gynecologic Surgeries", "date": "February 25, 2020", "contents": " Today, we are taking several important steps to make the use of laparoscopic power morcellators (LPMs) safer in gynecologic surgeries, including granting marketing authorization for updated labeling of the PneumoLiner containment system (a device that contains tissue to be morcellated during certain gynecologic surgeries), releasing a recommending the addition of specific safety information to the product labeling for LPMs, and issuing a recommending that an LPM only be used in certain gynecologic surgeries with a containment system that is compatible with the LPM. LPMs are used during laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgeries to cut tissue into smaller pieces so the tissue can be removed through a small incision site. These devices can be used in a variety of surgeries, including various gynecologic surgeries such as a myomectomy, a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids from a woman’s uterus. While laparoscopic surgeries are associated with shorter post-operative recovery time and a reduced risk of infection compared to traditional surgery, there are known risks associated with the use of LPMs, specifically in gynecologic surgeries. For example, current scientific evidence indicates that cancerous tissue may be present in uterine fibroids presumed to be benign (non-cancerous). When LPMs are used in surgeries where unsuspected cancerous tissue is present, there is a risk that morcellation could spread cancerous tissue throughout the body, decreasing a woman’s long-term survival. The FDA has taken many actions over the years to ensure the safe and effective use of LPMs. Some of these actions include the issuance of a , holding a to seek outside expert opinions, issuance of an recommending the addition of safety statements to the labeling for LPMs, and ensuring that up-to-date information regarding LPMs for gynecologic use is publicly available on the agency’s In 2016, the FDA authorized the use of a first-of-kind , called the PneumoLiner, for use with certain LPMs to isolate uterine tissue that is not suspected to contain cancer. The device includes a containment bag where the tissue to be removed is placed in the bag and sealed such that morcellated tissue is not spread throughout the abdominal cavity during the morcellation process. Although the device effectively contains morcellated tissue, to ensure that the benefits of this device continued to outweigh the risks, this device was only authorized for use in specific patient populations, including women without uterine fibroids undergoing hysterectomy and pre-menopausal women with fibroids who wish to maintain their fertility. We also required specific warnings to be included in the labeling so that both patients and health care providers were aware of the risks of morcellation during certain gynecologic procedures. Today, we are providing marketing authorization for the PneumoLiner containment system with updated labeling. While the device itself remains unchanged since its prior marketing authorization, today’s clearance updates the labeling for this device to better define the appropriate patient population for the safe and effective use of this device, including stating that the device should only be used in women who have fibroids if they are pre-menopausal and under 50 years old. The likelihood of unsuspected cancer in women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy increases with age such that the benefit-risk profile of using LPMs is worse in older women when compared to younger women. In addition to our efforts to ensure these devices are used in the appropriate patient population, as uncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of cancerous tissue, we are issuing draft guidance proposing to update our recommendations in the concerning the content and format of certain labeling information for LPMs. Specifically, the FDA is recommending that the labeling of LPMs include contraindications and warnings highlighting the following information regarding the risks of use of LPMs in gynecologic surgeries: We believe that the inclusion of accurate and detailed information in the labeling for LPMs, such as what is recommended in the draft guidance, will help both health care providers and patients understand the risks of using these devices, and aid in their decision to determine whether morcellation could be appropriate for them. Finally, today we are issuing an updated Safety Communication that provides important information to patients and health care providers on the risks associated with LPMs when used in certain gynecologic surgeries. This Safety Communication now recommends that an LPM only be used in certain surgeries with a containment system that is compatible with the LPM. This communication also contains recommendations for patients and health care providers if they are considering using LPMs for gynecologic surgery—such as discussing the risks and benefits of all available treatments options to determine whether morcellation is appropriate—and provides specific questions that patients can use to start a dialogue with their physician. Ensuring the safety of women’s health devices, including LPMs, remains a top priority for the agency. In taking these actions and making these recommendations, we considered available scientific information pertaining to the risk of spreading uterine tissue with uncontained power morcellation during gynecologic surgeries. We will continue to review information on laparoscopic power morcellation, including the latest data and evolving scientific literature, and are committed to continued communication to the public regarding our current thinking. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. The risk of occult cancer, including uterine sarcoma, increases with age, particularly in women over 50 years of age. This information should be shared with patients when considering surgery with the use of these devices. Uncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of benign uterine tissue, i.e., parasitic myomas and disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis. Laparoscopic power morcellators should only be used with a containment system. The containment system should be compatible with the laparoscopic power morcellator. Laparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated in gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be morcellated is known or suspected to contain malignancy. Laparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated for removal of uterine tissue containing suspected fibroids in patients who are post-menopausal or over 50 years of age, or candidates for en bloc tissue removal through the vagina or via a mini-laparotomy incision."},
{"title": "Coronavirus Update: FDA steps to ensure quality of foreign products", "date": "February 24, 2020", "contents": " Recently, we provided an update on FDA-wide activities we are engaged in related to the novel coronavirus outbreak:  COVID-19. We continue to take a multi-pronged approach to this public health emergency, including focusing on actively facilitating efforts to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease; surveilling the medical product supply chain for potential shortages or disruptions and helping to mitigate such impacts, as necessary; and leveraging the full breadth of our public health tools, including enforcement tools to stop fraudulent activity as we oversee the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products for American patients and consumers. Today, we are providing updated and more detailed information about the status of FDA inspections in China and the agency’s oversight of imported products from China, which have been impacted by this outbreak. While we are not able to conduct inspections in China right now, this is not hindering our efforts to monitor medical products and food safety. We have additional tools we are utilizing to monitor the safety of products from China, and in the meantime, we continue monitoring the global drug supply chain by  prioritizing risk-based inspections in other parts of the world. The FDA is not currently conducting inspections in China in response to the U.S. Department of State’s Travel Advisory to not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. We will continue to closely monitor the situation in China so that, when the travel advisory is changed, we will be prepared to resume routine inspections as soon as feasible. We already use other tools to help complement our inspections, including import screening, examinations, sampling, and import alerts, relying on a firm’s previous compliance history, and we use information from foreign governments as part of mutual recognition agreements. Thus, at this time, we can rely on these other tools to give us comprehensive oversight of FDA-regulated products entering this country. This is all part of our agency’s risk-based approach to ensuring quality, as well as compliance with applicable FDA requirements. It is important to reiterate that inspections are one of many tools that the agency uses to inform our risk strategy for imported FDA-regulated products and to help prevent products that do not meet the FDA’s standards from entering the U.S. market.  A wide variety of FDA-regulated products are imported from China, which makes it important to assure the public of the quality of these products. At this time, over 60% of FDA-regulated products imported from China are medical devices and 20% are housewares (like food packaging). In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the FDA will utilize, where appropriate, our authority to request records from firms “in advance or in lieu of” drug surveillance inspections in China. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012, gives the FDA authority to request records “in advance of or in lieu of” on-site drug inspections. Congress enacted this provision to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of inspections, given the increasing globalization of drug production.  Along with other FDASIA provisions, this inspection record request authority was viewed as a way to “level the playing field” between foreign and domestic drug inspections by allowing the FDA to review records ahead of time and take a more risk-based approach to conducting both domestic and foreign inspections. These records will help the agency when we resume drug inspections in China. By applying the use of paper records in our risk-based inspection framework, we can prioritize our early inspections on those deemed most needed, based on the records . By doing so, we hope to rapidly assess what could become a backlog number of on-the-ground surveillance inspections this fiscal year if travel restrictions persist. In addition to records requests, the FDA will continue working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the U.S. that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products, which may come from a variety of sources, such as first time importers unfamiliar with regulatory requirements or repeat offenders trying to skirt the law. FDA has the ability through our risk-based import screening tool (PREDICT) to focus our examinations and sample collections based on heightened concerns of specific products being entered into U.S. commerce. The PREDICT screening continues to adjust risk scores as necessary throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.  We are keeping a close eye out for indications of port shopping or cargo diversion and will continue our oversight of shipments through potentially higher-risk venues such as International Mail Facilities. We can refuse admission of products that fail sample testing or may violate other applicable legal requirements. Fortunately, currently, we are not seeing the impacts of this outbreak resulting in an increased public health risk for American consumers from imported products. There is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. As noted, this remains a dynamic situation and we will continue to assess, and update guidance as needed. We also continue to aggressively monitor the market for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 prevention and treatment claims. The FDA can and will use every authority at our disposal to protect consumers from bad actors who would take advantage of a crisis to deceive the public, including pursuing warning letters, seizures, or injunctions against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law. We know the public may have questions or concerns for the FDA as a result of this outbreak, including you and your family’s risk of exposure, or whether your critical medical products are safe and will continue to be available in the future. We assure you that the FDA is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate emerging coronavirus issues through collaborative efforts with U.S. regulators, international partners, and medical product developers and manufacturers to help advance response efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak."},

According to the , bronchospasms occur when the muscles surrounding the airways swell and tighten, squeezing the airways and making them smaller. Exercise and other physical activity can bring on symptoms in most people who have asthma and may occur either during or right after being active. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing), chest tightness, shortness of breath and coughing. The coughing often worsens at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 26 million people are known to have asthma, about 7 million of these people are children. The most common side effects associated with Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol are headache, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), pain, dizziness, sore throat (pharyngitis), rhinitis, chest pain, palpitations, tremor and nervousness. The FDA regularly takes steps to help guide industry through the development process for generic drug products, including combination products, such as metered dose inhalers, that consist of a drug and a device. The development of generic combination products can be more challenging than solid oral dosage forms, like tablets. Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA), individual companies can meet with the FDA as part of its program to support the development of such complex generic drug products. The FDA also publishes guidance documents describing the steps the FDA recommends companies take to submit complete applications for generic drug products. In 2016, the FDA issued a revised albuterol sulfate metered dose inhalers, including drug products referencing ProAir HFA. Among other things, the draft guidance provides bioequivalence recommendations. The FDA requires sponsors to submit appropriate data and information to demonstrate that complex generic drug-device combination products meet the agency’s rigorous approval standards. These standards ensure that quality generic drug products are as safe and effective as their brand name counterparts. In 2020, the FDA will continue to advance additional policies to promote generic competition for . Among other steps, the agency intends to publish additional guidance documents to aid in the development of specific complex generic drug products. The FDA also plans to publish a series of guidances to address regulatory and scientific challenges that make it generally more difficult to develop complex generic drug products because of their complex formulation or mode of delivery. As part of this, the FDA intends to issue draft guidance with recommendations on establishing active ingredient sameness. In addition, the FDA is going to help advance the development of new analytical tools and in vitro tests that may provide additional accurate, sensitive and reproducible ways to support development of complex generic drugs. Better tools can reduce complex generic drug development time and cost and can inform regulatory decisions. Addressing the challenges related to complex generics, and promoting more generic competition to these medicines, is a key part of the , and the agency’s efforts to promote patient access and more affordable medicines. The FDA granted approval of this generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Perrigo Pharmaceutical Co. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA launches mobile-friendly database with information on life-saving HIV drugs as part of ongoing mission to empower the public through increased access to information and data", "date": "January 29, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the launch of an that will offer a wealth of critical information about antiretrovirals (ARVs) eligible for purchase under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program. This launch is an important step in our ongoing commitment to address the global HIV epidemic and is consistent with our efforts to modernize and improve access to information and unleash the power of data. In my years as a practicing physician, I spent time on-the-ground involved in a program for those impacted by HIV in Botswana, Africa. I saw first-hand how essential it is to have access to low-cost, life-saving treatments for those impacted by HIV, regardless of where a patient may reside. The PEPFAR program is designed to meet this critical need. It was created in 2003 to address the global HIV crisis in the hardest hit countries. PEPFAR was designed to bring together various federal government agencies that are involved in fighting the epidemic by creating a unified response, providing the most comprehensive, coordinated and targeted interventions. Since PEPFAR was launched 17 years ago, low-cost, quality-assured, life-saving ARVs have been provided to more than 15 million people worldwide, and PEPFAR remains the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. The FDA plays a critical role in the global fight against HIV by ensuring safe and effective ARVs are available worldwide, including those eligible for purchase through the PEPFAR program. The FDA’s role is to ensure that the safety, effectiveness and quality of HIV drugs distributed under PEPFAR is the same as for drugs used to treat HIV patients in the U.S. While the FDA ensures ARVs intended for the global market are held to the same high standard as PEPFAR drugs intended for the U.S. market, drugs intended for PEPFAR are sometimes issued tentative approval by the FDA. The only difference between FDA approval and tentative approval is that drugs that are tentatively approved cannot be sold inside the U.S. due to the existence of intellectual property protections in the U.S. such as patents. Tentative approval of ARVs has allowed for both new and generic versions of life-saving HIV treatments to be made available to the international community. Once a drug obtains approval or tentative approval the PEPFAR program can purchase ARVs at low cost and distribute them outside the U.S. to countries with high HIV burdens. To implement the goals of PEPFAR, the FDA uses its existing processes, including expedited review to approve life-saving ARVs. To that end, the FDA has approved or tentatively approved 222 ARV applications for use in PEPFAR partner countries since 2004, of which 194 are still available for treatment today. Additionally, the FDA’s role of ensuring the availability of safe and effective HIV treatments reaches far beyond U.S.-based aid efforts, as global health entities, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the World Health Organization (WHO), recognize FDA-approved ARVs as quality-assured drugs. The list of the ARVs eligible for purchase in the PEPFAR program has long been publicly available on the agency’s website. By moving to an , we are empowering the public and health care providers by enhancing the amount and availability of information and data provided on each drug. For the first time, health care providers, consumers, and procurers will be able to easily access the FDA-reviewed product labeling, which will provide additional important information to patients and health care providers such as the full prescribing information (i.e., package insert) that contains a summary of essential scientific information needed for safe and effective use of the drug. In addition, there will be information on which drugs are suitable for pediatric populations, where each drug is manufactured, what its shelf-life is, and if the drug is subject to any storage requirements. Since the database platform is interactive, users will be able to export reports and collect metrics and can readily access this information on mobile platforms, which is important because in many PEPFAR partner countries this may be the only mode of receiving such information. Given these numerous improvements, we anticipate that this database will be valuable to various public health stakeholders in the international HIV communities. The launch of this interactive database marks another step in the agency’s commitments to ensuring information regarding these life-saving ARVs are available to the public and is part of the agency’s continued dedication to fighting the HIV epidemic. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Takes Significant Step in Coronavirus Response Efforts, Issues Emergency Use Authorization for the First 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diagnostic", "date": "February 04, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S Food and Drug Administration issued an to enable emergency use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories; today’s authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab across the country. The 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is a new type of coronavirus that can cause severe respiratory illness in humans. Most patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). However, limited information is currently available to characterize the full spectrum of clinical illness associated with 2019-nCoV infection. To date most reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection outside of China have been linked to residence in or travel to Wuhan, China. At this time, federal health officials continue to believe that the threat to the general American population from this virus is relatively low. Under this EUA, the use of 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is authorized for patients who meet the CDC criteria for 2019-nCoV testing. Testing is limited to qualified laboratories designated by the CDC and, in the U.S., those certified to perform high complexity tests. The diagnostic is a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that provides presumptive detection of 2019-nCoV from respiratory secretions, such as nasal or oral swabs. A positive test result indicates likely infection with 2019-nCoV and infected patients should work with their health care provider to manage their symptoms and determine how to best protect the people around them. Negative results do not preclude 2019-nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history and epidemiological information. The FDA can issue an EUA to permit the use, based on scientific data, of certain medical products that may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing such disease or condition when there is a determination, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), that there is a public health emergency or a significant potential for a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens, and a declaration that circumstances exist justifying the medical products’ emergency use. On Jan. 31, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency recognizing the potential threat that 2019-nCoV poses and reiterating the government’s dedication to leveraging all available resources to help prevent, mitigate and respond to this threat. As there are no commercially available diagnostic tests cleared or approved by the FDA for the detection of 2019-nCoV it was determined that an EUA is crucial to ensure timely access to diagnostics. The HHS Secretary accordingly today made the necessary EUA determination and declaration and the FDA issued this EUA in response to a request from the CDC. This action is the result of the close collaboration between the FDA, the CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which provides oversight for U.S. laboratories, to prioritize the efficient development and implementation of critical medical products in response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as novel coronavirus. to expediting the development and availability of critical medical products to prevent, diagnose and treat 2019-nCoV using all applicable regulatory authorities to respond to this outbreak on Jan. 27. The agency remains committed to working with developers, international partners and the U.S. government to help support this public health response. The FDA is dedicated to actively working with other 2019-nCoV diagnostic developers to help accelerate development programs and requests for EUAs, in fact several have already requested and received the EUA template for this outbreak. The FDA, among other steps, is providing its highest level of attention to helping expedite the development and review of a variety of medical products being developed to diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of this outbreak. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA approves first drug for treatment of peanut allergy for children", "date": "January 31, 2020", "contents": " Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Palforzia [Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) Allergen Powder-dnfp] to mitigate allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanuts. Treatment with Palforzia may be initiated in individuals ages 4 through 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy and may be continued in individuals 4 years of age and older. Those who take Palforzia must continue to avoid peanuts in their diets. Peanut allergy is a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies even small amounts of peanut as harmful. Allergic reactions to peanut are unpredictable in occurrence and in how they present, with some individuals experiencing severe reactions from even trace amounts. Physical symptoms can develop within seconds of exposure and may include skin reactions (e.g., hives, redness or swelling), digestive discomfort, or more dangerous reactions, such as constriction of the throat and airways, and loss of adequate blood flow to vital organs of the body. Antihistamines and epinephrine can be used to treat allergic reactions, but severe reactions can  be fatal even with appropriate, prompt treatment. Palforzia cannot be used for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Treatment with Palforzia consists of three phases: Initial Dose Escalation, Up-Dosing, and Maintenance. The Initial Dose Escalation phase is given on a single day. The Up-Dosing phase consists of 11 increasing dose levels and occurs over several months. Initial Dose Escalation, and the first dose of each Up-Dosing level, are administered under supervision of a healthcare professional in a healthcare setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. While anaphylaxis can occur at any time during Palforzia therapy, patients are at highest risk during and after the Initial Dose Escalation and the first dose of each Up-Dosing level. During Up-Dosing, if the patient tolerates the first dose of an increased dose level, the patient may continue that dose level daily at home. After a patient completes all Up-Dosing levels, they may begin the daily maintenance dose. Patients who experience certain allergic reactions due to Palforzia may need to discontinue treatment or have their dosing schedule modified. Palforzia is a powder that is manufactured from peanuts and packaged in pull-apart color-coded capsules for Dose Escalation and Up-Dosing, and in a sachet for maintenance treatment. The powder is emptied from the capsules or sachet and mixed with a small amount of semisolid food - such as applesauce, yogurt, or pudding - that the patient then consumes. The effectiveness of Palforzia is supported by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in the U.S., Canada and Europe in approximately 500 peanut-allergic individuals. Effectiveness was assessed by evaluating the percentage of study participants tolerating an oral challenge with a single 600 mg dose of peanut protein (twice the daily maintenance dose of Palforzia) with no more than mild allergic symptoms after 6 months of maintenance treatment. The results showed that 67.2% of Palforzia recipients tolerated a 600 mg dose of peanut protein in the challenge, compared to 4.0% of placebo recipients. The safety of Palforzia was assessed in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in approximately 700 peanut-allergic individuals. The most commonly reported side effects of Palforzia were abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, tingling in the mouth, itching (including in the mouth and ears), cough, runny nose, throat irritation and tightness, hives, wheezing and shortness of breath and anaphylaxis. Palforzia should not be administered to those with uncontrolled asthma. To mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis associated with Palforzia, the FDA is requiring a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with this approval, which includes elements to assure safe use. Palforzia will only be available through specially certified healthcare providers, health care settings, and pharmacies to patients who are enrolled in the REMS program. The FDA is requiring that healthcare providers who prescribe Palforzia - and healthcare settings that dispense and administer Palforzia - are educated on the risk of anaphylaxis associated with its use. In addition, the Initial Dose Escalation phase and first dose of each Up-Dosing level must only be administered to patients in a certified healthcare setting equipped to monitor patients and to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Patients or their parents or caregivers must also be counseled on the need for the patients to have injectable epinephrine available for immediate use at all times, the need for continued dietary peanut avoidance, and how to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. The FDA granted approval of Palforzia to Aimmune Therapeutics."},
{"title": "FDA and FTC Announce New Efforts to Further Deter Anti-Competitive Business Practices, Support Competitive Market for Biological Products to Help Americans", "date": "February 03, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission today signed a regarding enhanced collaboration in support of a robust marketplace for biological products, including the critical adoption of biosimilars and interchangeable products. This joint statement describes key steps the agencies will take to address false or misleading promotion about biosimilars within their respective authorities and deter anti-competitive behavior in this space. Biological products are a diverse category of products which may be produced through biotechnology in a living system, such as a microorganism, plant cell, or animal cell, and are used to diagnose, prevent, treat, and cure diseases and medical conditions. are biological products that are highly similar to and have no clinically meaningful differences from existing FDA-approved “reference” products. Reference products are FDA-approved biological products against which proposed biosimilar products are compared. Biosimilar and interchangeable products have the potential to greatly reduce health care costs, similar to what has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. The 1984 Hatch Waxman Act, which created an abbreviated path to market for generic versions of small molecule drugs, has over the past decade. While the U.S. market for biosimilar versions of biological products is still maturing, the FDA’s research suggests that after market entry, biosimilars have the potential to offer significant savings. Biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products. However, anti-competitive practices, such as making false or misleading statements comparing biological reference products and biosimilars, may be slowing progress and hampering uptake of these important therapies. The FDA and the FTC have serious concerns about such statements and their negative impact on public health, including their potential to create negative misperceptions about the safety or effectiveness of approved biosimilars. The agencies intend to take appropriate steps to address companies making false or misleading communications about biologics, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, which will help deter anti-competitive behavior in the biologics market and can help lead to the use of all available biological products. As detailed in the joint statement, the agencies will also collaborate on future public outreach efforts, including bringing together participants from industry, academia and government agencies to discuss issues relating to competition in the biologics market. To this end, today we’re also announcing that the FDA and FTC will hold a public workshop, “ ” on March 9 at the FDA’s White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, Md. The agencies will exchange information, when appropriate, about best practices to prevent activities that impede access to samples of the reference product that the prospective biosimilar applicant needs for testing. Additionally, the FTC intends to review patent settlement agreements involving biosimilars, to prevent antitrust violations. Another key to ensuring that public information surrounding biosimilars and their reference products is communicated in a truthful and non-misleading manner is the FDA’s regulation of industry’s promotional materials for all prescription drugs, including biosimilar and reference products. Therefore, the FDA is publishing a outlining its current thinking on presenting data and information in a truthful and non-misleading way about biosimilars and reference products in FDA-regulated promotional materials. It addresses questions companies may have when developing these kinds of materials and provides examples that can help with specific situations biosimilar and reference product companies may encounter. Availability of this new draft guidance and ongoing collaboration with the FTC is part of the FDA’s continuing work to help ensure truthful and non-misleading prescription drug promotion and serves as another example of the FDA’s commitment to public health by addressing anti-competitive tactics that aim to undermine confidence in the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biosimilar products. Today’s announcements are key deliverables in the FDA’s that outlines four key strategies to accelerate biosimilar competition, including supporting market competition and providing clearer direction to industry on the development of promotional materials for medical products. The FDA is from the public on the draft guidance from Feb. 4 to April 6. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

It is paramount, however, that as we move forward, we maintain standards of safety and effectiveness. “This is a tremendously exciting field. Because we’re committed to fostering advances in this space, we take a risk-based approach to oversight. We want to ensure that the intentional genomic alterations in animals are safe for the animal, safe for people eating food products from the animal and that the alteration does what it’s intended to do. That’s why we encourage sponsors to participate in our , which facilitates advancements in the development of innovative animal products by providing greater clarity in the regulatory process, encouraging development and research and supporting an efficient and predictable pathway to approval. “We are taking steps to help ensure confidence in products of biotechnology and will soon be undertaking a public education campaign to help consumers learn about the safety and benefits of agricultural biotechnology products. We are committed to partnering with America’s farmers, innovators, biotechnology companies and research universities who are at the forefront of this remarkable moment of scientific advance. “The FDA is leveraging our scientific and technical expertise and regulatory experience to oversee intentional genomic alterations in animals developed using novel techniques, such as genome editing, through a timely and efficient process. The agency is a trusted global regulator and we are committed to overseeing this space in a manner that fosters innovation, promotes consumer confidence and protects the public health.” “Today, the journal Nature Biotechnology published the FDA-authored analysis ‘ ,’ which describes how a bioinformatics method developed by FDA scientists was able to detect previously unreported, unintended alterations in genome-edited bulls. The analysis emphasizes the FDA’s expertise and critical role in risk-based evaluation of intentional genomic alterations. “Our analysis demonstrated that genome editing in animals can have unintended consequences, and in this case, it caused foreign DNA to be integrated into the animals’ genomes. While the existence of an unintended alteration does not necessarily mean that the genome edit is unsafe to animals or consumers, it does show that both scientists and regulators need to be alert to the potential for such unintended alterations to take place. “A companion piece, ‘ ,’ also published today explains the value of the agency’s oversight of intentional genomic alterations in animals to protect animal and human health, even when the intended modification seeks to replicate a naturally occurring mutation.

{"title": "FDA Authorizes Marketing of First Cardiac Ultrasound Software That Uses Artificial Intelligence to Guide User", "date": "February 07, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of software to assist medical professionals in the acquisition of cardiac ultrasound, or echocardiography, images. The software, called Caption Guidance, is an accessory to compatible diagnostic ultrasound systems and uses artificial intelligence to help the user capture images of a patient’s heart that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. The Caption Guidance software is indicated for use in ultrasound examination of the heart, known as two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE), for adult patients, specifically in the acquisition of standard views of the heart from different angles. These views are typically used in the diagnosis of various cardiac conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing one out of every four people, or approximately 647,000 Americans each year. The term heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which can cause heart attack. Other kinds of heart disease may involve the valves in the heart, or the heart may not pump well and cause heart failure. Cardiac diagnostic tests are necessary to identify heart conditions. Among them are electrocardiograms (more widely known as an EKG or ECG), Holter monitors and cardiac ultrasound examinations. The software authorized today is the first software authorized to guide users through cardiac ultrasound image acquisition. The Caption Guidance software was developed using machine learning to train the software to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable image quality. This knowledge formed the basis of an interactive AI user interface that provides prescriptive guidance to users on how to maneuver the ultrasound probe to acquire standard echocardiographic images and video clips of diagnostic quality. The AI interface provides real-time feedback on potential image quality, can auto-capture video clips, and automatically saves the best video clip acquired from a particular view. Importantly, the cardiologist still reviews the images for a final assessment of the images and videos for patient evaluation. The Caption Guidance software currently can be used with a specific FDA-cleared diagnostic ultrasound system produced by Teratech Corporation, with the potential to be used with other ultrasound imaging systems that have technical specifications consistent with the range of ultrasound systems used as part of the development and testing. In its review of this device application, the FDA evaluated data from two independent studies. In one study, 50 trained sonographers scanned patients, with and without the assistance of the Caption Guidance software. The sonographers were able to capture comparable diagnostic quality images in both settings. The other study involved training eight registered nurses who are not experts in sonography to use the Caption Guidance software and asking them to capture standard echocardiography images, followed by five cardiologists assessing the quality of the images acquired. The results showed that the Caption Guidance software enabled the registered nurses to acquire echocardiography images and videos of diagnostic quality. The FDA is dedicated to ensuring medical device regulation keeps pace with technological advancements, such as today’s marketing authorization. This February, the FDA is hosting a public workshop titled “ ” and seeks to discuss emerging applications of AI in radiological imaging, including AI devices intended to automate the diagnostic radiology workflow, as well as guided image acquisition. Discussions will also focus on best practices for the validation of AI-automated radiological imaging software and image acquisition devices, which is critical to assess safety and effectiveness. The FDA reviewed the device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Caption Guidance software to Caption Health Inc.

The initiative, “ ,” aims to answer the most common questions that consumers have about GMOs, including what GMOs are, how and why they are made, how they are regulated and to address health and safety questions that consumers may have about these products. The “Feed Your Mind” initiative is launching in phases. The materials released today include a new website, as well as a selection of fact sheets, infographics and videos. Additional materials—including a supplementary science curriculum for high schools, resources for health professionals and additional consumer materials—will be released later in 2020 and 2021. To guide development of the “Feed Your Mind” initiative, the three government agencies formed a steering committee and several working groups consisting of agency leaders and subject matter experts; sought input from stakeholders through two public meetings; opened a docket to receive public comments; examined the latest science and research related to consumer understanding of genetically engineered foods; and conducted extensive formative research.

{"title": "FDA Advances Work Related to Cannabidiol Products with Focus on Protecting Public Health, Providing Market Clarity", "date": "March 05, 2020", "contents": " Over the past year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has embarked on a comprehensive evaluation of cannabidiol (CBD) products, with a focus on educating the public about the risks and unknowns of these products, gathering the science needed to better understand both these safety concerns and potential benefits to inform our regulatory approach, as well as taking steps when necessary to address products that violate the law in ways that raise a variety of public health concerns. Today, we are providing updates on our efforts in this area, including several new steps in areas of education, research and enforcement with the ultimate goal of continuing to protect the public health and working to provide market clarity. We’re seeing CBD being marketed in a number of different products, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, food products, such as chocolate bars and teas, cosmetics and other topical lotions and creams, as well as products marketed for pets and other animals – and we understand consumers are seeking out these novel products for a variety of perceived health-related or other reasons. But as the agency has stated before, we are concerned that some people wrongly think that the myriad of CBD products on the market have been evaluated by the FDA and determined to be safe, or that using CBD ‘can’t hurt.’ Aside from one prescription drug approved to treat two rare, severe pediatric epilepsy disorders, no other CBD products have been evaluated or approved by the FDA. We remain focused on educating the public about the number of questions that remain regarding CBD’s safety. There may be risks that need to be considered before using CBD products outside of the monitored setting of a prescription from your health care provider. In particular, the agency recently on concerns about potential harm from CBD products, including potential liver injury, interactions with other drugs and male reproductive toxicity, as well as side effects such as drowsiness. In addition, there is still much we do not know about other potential risks. For example, other than the approved prescription drug, we know little about the potential effects of sustained and/or cumulative use of CBD, co-administration with other medicines, or the risks to vulnerable populations like children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, unborn children and certain animal populations. This does not mean that we know CBD is unsafe to these populations or under these circumstances, but given the gaps in our current knowledge, and the known risks that have been identified, we also are not at a point where we can conclude that unapproved CBD products are safe for use. We encourage Americans to consult with their health care providers before using CBD products. We will continue to expand our educational efforts on this front. This includes consumers broadly, specific populations where there are additional, important health considerations, as well as health care professionals who must understand these risks when talking to their patients. We will also continue to for consumers, researchers and industry, as well as sustain multiple lines of communication with Congress, industry, researchers and our regulatory partners at the federal, state, local, territorial, tribal and international levels to share and collect needed information and hear a variety of perspectives. The marketplace for CBD-containing products is quickly evolving and it is critical that we work together with stakeholders and industry to develop high-quality data to close the knowledge gaps about the science, safety and quality of many of these products, as well as further evaluate any potential benefits outside of the one FDA-approved drug product to treat two rare, severe pediatric epilepsy disorders. To address the questions and concerns we’ve already raised, we’re seeking reliable and high-quality data. This includes data on, among other things: the sedative effects of CBD; the impacts of long-term sustained or cumulative exposure to CBD; transdermal penetration and pharmacokinetics of CBD; the effect of different routes of CBD administration (e.g., oral, topical, inhaled) on its safety profile; the safety of CBD for use in pets and food-producing animals; and the processes by which “full spectrum” and “broad spectrum” hemp extracts are derived, what the content of such extracts is, and how these products may compare to CBD isolate products. Given the importance of answering these questions, we’re exploring a number of ways to address the data gaps as quickly as possible. This includes encouraging, facilitating and initiating more research on CBD, providing venues for industry and researchers to share new data with the agency and identifying opportunities to further collaborate with our federal partners at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and National Institute on Drug Abuse on this important issue. Importantly, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 – which, among other things, changed federal law so that cannabis and cannabis derivatives with very low levels of the psychoactive intoxicating component of cannabis, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are no longer controlled substances – has opened significant new opportunities for research, and as that body of research develops and grows, there will be considerably more information available. In particular, there’s been an increased interest in and other compounds found in cannabis and we are working to support drug development as much as possible. First, given all the research and activity in this space, we are taking new steps to provide a public and transparent way for stakeholders to provide new and emerging information to us in real time as it becomes available. To this end, in the coming days we are re-opening the public docket we established for our May 2019 public hearing. The docket provides a valuable conduit for submission of scientific data on CBD to the agency, so we have decided to extend the comment period indefinitely to allow the public to comment and to share relevant data with the agency. As the agency continues to move forward to explore viable pathways for CBD products outside the drug context, this extension will allow stakeholders to continue to provide relevant data as research in this area evolves. This docket also includes a mechanism for a stakeholder to submit data or information that the stakeholder believes to be confidential. We hope that this will enable responsible industry participants, academic researchers, and other stakeholders to share relevant information with the FDA – including information about specific products, which could help inform appropriate regulatory steps. We also are working to generate data to help inform our work in this area. For example, the FDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist recently awarded a grant to the FDA’s National Center for Toxicological Research to conduct a study to better understand the effects of CBD exposure during pregnancy. Additionally, we’ve initiated a research study in partnership with the University of Mississippi to evaluate the levels of CBD and THC in a sample of cosmetic products to assess sensitization of THC and CBD topically, and dermal penetration. As data become available that are high-quality, reliable and relevant to our evaluation of CBD products that fall under the FDA’s purview, we will be able to refine – and, perhaps in some cases, revise – our thinking and approaches. As we work to educate the public and close the knowledge gaps to further guide our approach to CBD products, we will continue to monitor the marketplace and take appropriate action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public. We have seen many CBD products being marketed with claims of therapeutic benefit, such as treating or curing serious diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, or other drug claims, without having gone through the drug approval process. The proliferation of such products may deter consumers from seeking proven, safe medical therapies for serious illnesses – potentially endangering their health or life. We also have serious concerns about products that put the public at risk in other ways. For example, we are aware of the risks posed by product contaminants such as heavy metals, THC or other potentially harmful substances. We also have significant concerns about products marketed with false claims or statements such as omitted ingredients, incorrect statements about the amount of CBD, products marketed for use by vulnerable populations like children or infants, and products that otherwise put the public health at risk. As we move forward, we are currently evaluating issuance of a risk-based enforcement policy that would provide greater transparency and clarity regarding factors the agency intends to take into account in prioritizing enforcement decisions. Any enforcement policy would need to further the goals of protecting the public and providing more clarity to industry and the public regarding the FDA’s enforcement priorities while we take potential steps to establish a clear regulatory pathway. Our ongoing efforts related to CBD, including the steps we’re announcing today, are in line with our mission to protect the public, foster innovation and promote consumer confidence. We recognize the significant public interest in CBD and we must work together with stakeholders and industry to develop high-quality data to close the substantial knowledge gaps about the science, safety and quality of many of these products. We are committed to working efficiently to further clarify our regulatory approach to these products – as always, using science as our guide and upholding our rigorous public health standards.

{"title": "FDA Reminds Patients that Devices Claiming to Clean, Disinfect or Sanitize CPAP Machines Using Ozone Gas or UV Light Have Not Been FDA Authorized ", "date": "February 27, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is issuing a to inform patients and health care providers that devices claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices or accessories (such as masks, tubing, headgear) using ozone gas or ultraviolet (UV) light are not legally marketed for this use by the FDA in the U.S., and as such, their safety and effectiveness for use with CPAP devices and accessories is unknown. CPAP devices are often prescribed for home use to patients with obstructive sleep apnea, a condition where an individual’s airway becomes blocked during sleep causing breathing to intermittently stop and start. CPAP devices use air pressure to keep airways open during sleep. To ensure the safe and effective cleaning of CPAP devices and accessories, the FDA is recommending that consumers and health care providers follow the cleaning instructions provided by the CPAP’s manufacturer, which normally include regular cleaning with soap and water. The FDA has received 11 reports from 2017-2019 from patients experiencing cough, difficult breathing, nasal irritation, headaches, asthma attacks and other breathing complaints when ozone gas-based products were used to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories. The FDA has not received any adverse event reports for UV light products claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize CPAP devices and accessories. Ozone is a gas that can be used to kill harmful bacteria. However, for ozone to be effective in killing harmful bacteria, it must be present at a concentration far greater than what is considered safe for humans. Although products claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize CPAP devices that use ozone gas claim that they are designed to keep ozone gas inside the machine and its accessories, leaks can occur at tubing connections, filters or through containers used to house CPAP accessories. When leaks occur, ozone gas in the room where the devices are used may temporarily rise to unsafe levels especially if the room is small or not well ventilated. Additionally, if the CPAP machine or accessories are used without first allowing fresh air to circulate through the entire CPAP system to remove any remaining ozone gas, this could lead to someone inhaling ozone gas, which could cause breathing problems. Direct exposure to UV light may cause injury depending on its wavelength, intensity and exposure time. Additionally, the UV light may not be able to penetrate all components of CPAP devices and accessories, like the plastic tubing, masks and connectors, which could lead to inadequately disinfected components that may be unsafe for people to reuse. While these devices claiming to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP machines and accessories have not been FDA cleared or approved for marketing in the U.S., the FDA conducted its own preliminary lab testing on several of those illegally marketed products. The testing demonstrated ozone-using disinfection devices generated ambient levels of ozone above limits considered safe for human exposure. Ozone levels were also high in CPAP machines and tubing even after waiting the amount of time recommended by the ozone-based device manufacturer after a cleaning cycle. The FDA’s studies also showed the power of the UV light and time during which CPAP masks and accessories were exposed to this light varied considerably among UV cleaners. If CPAP components are exposed to insufficiently strong UV light or processed for an insufficient amount of time, the CPAP components could be inadequately disinfected leading to safety and performance issues. The FDA has contacted manufacturers of the ozone gas and UV light products that claim to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories. Each manufacturer was informed that based on their product’s intended use and technological characteristics, FDA review and clearance or approval is needed and that data would need to be provided to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDA will continue to monitor reports of adverse events associated with the use of ozone gas or UV-based CPAP devices that claim to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories and update the public should new information become available. The FDA encourages individuals related to the use these devices to the FDA.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Provides More Regulatory Relief During Outbreak, Continues to Help Expedite Availability of Diagnostics", "date": "March 16, 2020", "contents": " Today, as part of our ongoing and aggressive commitment to address the coronavirus outbreak, the FDA updated a originally issued on Feb. 29 on diagnostic testing for coronavirus (COVID-19) in order to achieve more rapid testing capacity in the U.S. We believe the unprecedented policy set forth in today’s updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories. This action demonstrates the FDA’s ability to pivot and adapt as the situation warrants in light of a public health emergency. We are taking steps to support diagnostic development considering the urgent need. We urge state authorities and commercial developers to take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of accurate tests. Inaccurate diagnoses during a pandemic can impair prevention efforts and delay appropriate treatment for sick patients. Our guidance provides more specific details for the laboratory and commercial manufacturer communities, but I want to highlight three key elements of the update we are issuing today. First, we are putting in place a policy for states to take responsibility for tests developed and used by laboratories in their states, similar to the action the FDA granted to the New York State Department of Health last week. States can set up a system in which they take responsibility for authorizing such tests and the laboratories will not engage with the FDA. As stated in the guidance, the system does not need to mirror that of New York. Laboratories developing tests in these states can engage directly with the appropriate state authorities, instead of with the FDA. Nor will these laboratories pursue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the FDA. Second, we are expanding who the policy outlined in the Feb. 29 guidance applies to. The policy was originally applicable only to laboratories that are certified to perform high-complexity testing consistent with requirements under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Under the update published today, the agency does not intend to object to commercial manufacturers distributing and labs using new commercially developed tests prior to the FDA granting an EUA, under certain circumstances. The FDA is aware that numerous commercial manufacturers are developing tests for coronavirus with the intention of submitting an EUA to the FDA. During this public health emergency, the FDA does not intend to object to the distribution and use of these tests for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after the manufacturer’s validation of the test and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request where the manufacturer provides instructions for use of the test and posts data about the test’s performance characteristics on the manufacturer’s website. As noted in the guidance, the FDA believes that 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a test whose performance characteristics have already been validated by the manufacturer. Finally, our updated policy provides recommendations for test developers who may wish to develop serological tests for use during this coronavirus outbreak. Serological tests measure the amount of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection. We recognize that serology tests are less complex than molecular tests and are solely used to identify antibodies, which limits their effectiveness for diagnosis; however, as stated in the updated guidance, the FDA does not intend to object to the distribution and use of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 where the test has been validated, notification is provided to the FDA, and warning statements are included with the tests, for example, noting the test has not been reviewed by the FDA and results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status. The FDA has engaged with more than 100 test developers since the end of January, providing templates and advice about the EUA process. More than 80 developers have sought our assistance with development and validation of tests they plan to bring through the EUA process. We’ve granted multiple diagnostic EUAs during this outbreak. We are updating frequently asked questions for labs and test developers, providing information on alternative sources of reagents, extraction kits, swabs and more. We’ve also set up a toll-free line, 1-888-INFO-FDA, to help labs with any questions they may have about the EUA process, our policies or getting supplies. We know that people want to know the current numbers of tests in the field and how many patients are being tested. This number fluctuates daily as more and more test developers get their tests in the field and start testing patients. At this time, the FDA is focused on making sure tests are distributed and that test developers and labs have the materials they need to run the tests. The FDA continues to maintain operations 24/7 and we are here to support laboratories and test developers as they distribute tests through the country during this time of urgent need."},

{"title": "FDA requires new health warnings for cigarette packages and advertisements ", "date": "March 17, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. The warnings feature textual statements with photo-realistic color images depicting some of the lesser-known, but serious health risks of cigarette smoking, including impact to fetal growth, cardiac disease, diabetes and more. Beginning June 18, 2021, these new cigarette health warnings will be required to appear prominently on cigarette packages and in advertisements, occupying the top 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. Once implemented, the new warnings must be randomly and equally displayed and distributed on cigarette packages and rotated quarterly in cigarette advertisements. As the FDA outlined in the , the agency undertook a science-based approach to develop and evaluate the new cigarette health warnings. These warnings focus on serious health risks that are less known by the public as being negative health consequences of smoking. For example, current smokers have been found to have almost four times the risk of bladder cancer as never smokers, and it has been estimated that smoking is responsible for 5,000 bladder cancer deaths in the U.S. each year — yet research shows the public has limited awareness of bladder cancer as a consequence of smoking. While the proposed rule put forward 13 warnings for consideration, the FDA finalized a set of 11 required warnings for the final rule based on the full results of the FDA's consumer research studies, the relevant scientific literature, public comments submitted to the proposed rule docket and other legal and policy considerations. The final cigarette health warnings each consist of one of the following textual warning statements paired with an accompanying photo-realistic image depicting the negative health consequences of smoking: In addition, the FDA has issued a guidance to accompany the final rule.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues Temporary Policy for FSMA Onsite Audit Requirements", "date": "March 17, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took steps to help prevent disruptions in the food supply-chain by issuing a temporary policy for FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) supplier verification onsite audit requirements during the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health emergency. “While our grocery stores are facing unprecedented demand, we are working with industry to minimize disruptions in the supply-chain due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The policy released today will help to minimize disruptions so that the food industry can meet the demand while also continuing to conduct supplier verification activities that are designed to ensure food safety and following government travel restrictions and advisories. While we are confident that stores will remain open and supply will continue to meet demand nationwide, we ask all Americans to only purchase enough food and essentials for the week ahead.” Three of the regulations created to implement FSMA - the Preventive Controls for Human Food (PC Human Food) rule, Preventive Controls for Animal Food (PC Animal Food) rule, and Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) rule – require receiving facilities and importers to conduct supplier verification activities based on the hazard analysis conducted as part of their written Food Safety Plan or FSVP. When receiving facilities and importers develop their Food Safety Plans or FSVP, they sometimes determine onsite audits to be the most appropriate supplier verification activity. However, the travel restrictions and advisories associated with the novel coronavirus may make some audits temporarily impractical to conduct. Therefore, the policy announced today states that the agency will temporarily not enforce FSMA supplier verification onsite audit requirements if other appropriate supplier verification methods are used instead. Other supplier verification methods, such as sampling and testing or a review of food safety records, would be designed to provide sufficient assurance that hazards have been significantly minimized or prevented during the period of onsite audit delay. The FDA anticipates that receiving facilities and FSVP importers will resume onsite audits within a reasonable period of time after it becomes practicable to do so, and update their food safety plans and FSVPs accordingly. The FDA intends to provide timely notice before withdrawing this policy. Separately, the FDA, in collaboration with industry and our federal and state partners, is closely monitoring the food supply chain for any shortages. We are in regular contact with food manufacturers and grocery stores. There are no nationwide shortages of food, although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the U.S. and there are currently no wide-spread disruptions reported in the supply chain."},
{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues Guidance for Conducting Clinical Trials", "date": "March 18, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a for industry, investigators and institutional review boards conducting clinical trials during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The FDA recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical trials of medical products, including drugs, devices and biological products. Challenges may arise, for example, from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for the investigational product, or other considerations if site personnel or trial subjects become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in conducting the clinical trials. The FDA is aware that protocol modifications may be required, and that there may be unavoidable protocol deviations due to COVID-19. Although the impact of COVID-19 on trials will vary depending on many factors, including the nature of disease under study, the trial design and in what region(s) the study is being conducted, the FDA outlines considerations to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of trial participants, maintaining compliance with good clinical practice and minimizing risks to trial integrity. Considerations recommended include, among others, sponsors evaluating alternative methods for assessments, like phone contacts or virtual visits and offering additional safety monitoring for those trial participants who may no longer have access to investigational product or the investigational site. “With this guidance issued today, the FDA is helping industry and investigators navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and help assess how to move forward with critical clinical trials,” said Anand Shah, M.D., FDA Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs “The FDA released this guidance to emphasize that at all times, patients’ safety should continue to be at the forefront of considerations.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Treatment for Adults with Cushing’s Disease", "date": "March 06, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Isturisa (osilodrostat) oral tablets for adults with Cushing’s disease who either cannot undergo pituitary gland surgery or have undergone the surgery but still have the disease. Cushing’s disease is a rare disease in which the adrenal glands make too much of the cortisol hormone. Isturisa is the first FDA-approved drug to directly address this cortisol overproduction by blocking the enzyme known as 11-beta-hydroxylase and preventing cortisol synthesis. Cushing’s disease is caused by a pituitary tumor that releases too much of a hormone called adrenocorticotropin, which stimulates the adrenal gland to produce an excessive amount of cortisol. The disease is most common among adults between the ages of 30 to 50, and it affects women three times more often than men. Cushing’s disease can cause significant health issues, such as high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood clots in the legs and lungs, bone loss and fractures, a weakened immune system and depression. Patients may have thin arms and legs, a round red full face, increased fat around the neck, easy bruising, striae (purple stretch marks) and weak muscles. Isturisa’s safety and effectiveness for treating Cushing’s disease among adults was evaluated in a study of 137 adult patients (about three-quarters women) with a mean age of 41 years. The majority of patients either had undergone pituitary surgery that did not cure Cushing’s disease or were not surgical candidates. In the 24-week, single-arm, open-label period, all patients received a starting dose of 2 milligrams (mg) of Isturisa twice a day that could be increased every two weeks up to 30 mg twice a day. At the end of this 24-week period, about half of patients had cortisol levels within normal limits. After this point, 71 patients who did not need further dose increases and tolerated the drug for the last 12 weeks entered an eight-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study where they either received Isturisa or a placebo (inactive treatment). At the end of this withdrawal period, 86% of patients receiving Isturisa maintained cortisol levels within normal limits compared to 30% of patients taking the placebo. The most common side effects reported in the clinical trial for Isturisa were adrenal insufficiency, headache, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention). Hypocortisolism (low cortisol levels), QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm condition) and elevations in adrenal hormone precursors (inactive substance converted into a hormone) and androgens (hormone that regulates male characteristics) may also occur in people taking Isturisa. Isturisa is taken by mouth twice a day, in the morning and evening as directed by a health care provider. After treatment has started, a provider may re-evaluate dosage, depending upon the patient’s response. Isturisa received , which is a special status granted to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition. The FDA granted the approval of Isturisa to Novartis.

The warning letters are the first to be issued by the FDA for unapproved products intended to prevent or treat “Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). The FDA is particularly concerned that products that claim to cure, treat or prevent serious diseases like COVID-19 may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. The FDA and FTC jointly issued warning letters to .  The products cited in these warning letters are teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver. The FDA has that colloidal silver is not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition. The FDA and FTC requested companies respond in 48 hours describing the specific steps they have taken to correct the violations. Companies that sell products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 may be subject to legal action, including but not limited to seizure or injunction. There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. Although there are investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development, these investigational products are in the early stages of product development and have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness. In addition to following up with companies that fail to make adequate corrections, the FDA and FTC will continue to monitor social media, online marketplaces and incoming complaints to help ensure that the companies do not continue to sell fraudulent products under a different company name or on another website. An FDA cross-agency task force has been established and dedicated to closely monitor for fraudulent products related to COVID-19. The task force has already reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring their online marketplaces for fraudulent products claiming to combat coronavirus and other pathogens. The task force has already worked with major retailers and online marketplaces to remove more than three dozen listings of fraudulent COVID-19 products. Several have already agreed to monitor their marketplaces for COVID-19 claims. The FDA reminds consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, mitigate, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. Fraudulent COVID-19 products may come in many varieties, including dietary supplements and other foods, as well as products purporting to be drugs, medical devices or vaccines. Products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat, diagnose or prevent disease, but are not proven safe and effective for those purposes, defraud consumers of money and can place consumers at risk for serious harm. Using these products may lead to delays in getting proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other potentially serious diseases and conditions.

{"title": "FDA Proposes Broad Approach for Conducting Safety Trials for Type 2 Diabetes Medications ", "date": "March 09, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a new draft guidance, “ ,” to solicit public comment on its proposals for broad safety evaluations before drug approval that look beyond ischemic (reduced blood flow)  cardiovascular disease, as well as for the inclusion of a broader scope of human subjects, such as older subjects and those with chronic kidney disease who may be more vulnerable to drug-related side effects. The new draft guidance does not contain the recommendation that sponsors of all new therapies for type 2 diabetes uniformly rule out a specific degree of risk for ischemic cardiovascular adverse outcomes, which was recommended in previous guidance and has typically been done through cardiovascular outcome trials. “The FDA continues to review new clinical trial evidence and update its recommendations for drug development to reflect emerging scientific information,” said Lisa Yanoff, M.D., acting director of the Division for Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “By following previous FDA recommendations, sponsors have shown that new type 2 diabetes drugs do not have excess ischemic cardiovascular risk, which has provided reassuring cardiovascular safety information for millions of diabetes patients. Now, with this proposed approach, we will have broader, valuable safety information for these medications.” The 2020 draft guidance stems from the ongoing evaluation of cardiovascular outcomes trials and recommendations from the FDA’s , which noted safety data beyond ischemic cardiovascular safety data was desired to evaluate the safety profile of antidiabetic drugs before they were approved. More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, and 90% to 95% of them have type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes can suffer from serious medical complications, such as nerve damage, kidney and eye damage, sleep apnea, and heart and blood vessel disease, as a result of high glucose (blood sugar) levels in the blood. These patients may also be more likely to die prematurely compared with people without type 2 diabetes. While a healthy lifestyle may slow or even stop the disease, many patients also take medications to improve glycemic (blood sugar) control. It is important that companies robustly evaluate the medications’ safety in clinical trials to identify risks. This knowledge can help patients and their health care providers make the most informed treatment decisions. The 2020 draft guidance will replace the FDA guidances for industry, “Diabetes Mellitus – Evaluating Cardiovascular Risk in New Antidiabetic Therapies to Treat Type 2 Diabetes,” published in December 2008, and “Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention,” published in February 2008.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Therapy for Patients with Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma", "date": "March 02, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc), in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Sarclisa, administered through intravenous (IV) infusion, is a CD38-directed cytolytic antibody that works by helping certain cells in the immune system attack multiple myeloma cancer cells. Multiple myeloma is a form of blood cancer that occurs in infection-fighting plasma cells (a type of white blood cell) found in the bone marrow. These cancerous cells multiply, produce an abnormal protein and push out other healthy blood cells from the bone marrow. The disease may result in a weakened immune system and cause other bone or kidney problems. The National Cancer Institute estimates there would be 32,270 new cases of multiple myeloma and 12,830 related deaths in the United States in 2020. The FDA approved Sarclisa based on the results of a clinical trial involving 307 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Half of the patients received Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone and the other half received only pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. The efficacy of Sarclisa was based on progression-free survival (PFS) – the amount of time a patient stays alive without the cancer growing. Patients who received Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone showed improvement in PFS with a 40% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to patients who received pomalidomide and dexamethasone. These patients also had an overall response rate of 60.4%. In comparison, the patients who only received pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone had an overall response rate of 35.3%. Common side effects for patients taking Sarclisa were neutropenia (abnormally low levels of white blood cells), infusion-related reactions, pneumonia (infection of the air sacs in one or both of the lungs), upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, anemia, lymphopenia (decrease in the level of white blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (abnormally low levels of platelets). Sarclisa can cause serious side effects, which include the following. Sarclisa can cause IV infusion-related reactions. In a grade three or higher (severe) reaction, the Sarclisa infusion should be permanently discontinued and health care professionals should institute appropriate medical management. Sarclisa can also cause neutropenia and health care professionals should monitor a patient’s complete blood cell count periodically during treatment, as well as monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Higher incidences of second primary malignancies (a second primary cancer that may occur in the same tissue or organ as the first cancer or in another region of the body) were observed in a controlled clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma receiving Sarclisa. Therefore, health care professionals should monitor patients for the development of a second primary malignancy when taking Sarclisa. Laboratory test interference may be experienced with Sarclisa. Blood banks should be informed that patients are receiving Sarclisa because the drug may interfere with certain tests that are done by blood banks (such as antibody screening) for patients who need a blood transfusion. Health care professionals should type and screen patients prior to starting treatment with Sarclisa. Sarclisa may interfere with the assays (tests) used to monitor M-protein, which may impact the determination of complete response. Health care professionals should advise pregnant women that Sarclisa may cause harm to a developing fetus. Women who are pregnant should not use Sarclisa. Women planning to become pregnant should use effective contraceptives during and for at least five months after treatment.

{"title": "FDA’s Actions in Response to 2019 Novel Coronavirus at Home and Abroad", "date": "February 14, 2020", "contents": " The FDA plays an essential role in overseeing our Nation’s medical products as part of our vital mission to protect and promote public health, including during public health emergencies. The FDA is an active partner in the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) response, working closely with our government and public health partners across the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as with our international counterparts. Our work is multifaceted, focusing on actively facilitating efforts to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease; surveilling the medical product supply chain for potential shortages or disruptions and helping to mitigate such impacts, as necessary; and leveraging the full breadth of our public health tools as we oversee the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products for American patients and consumers. We are keenly aware that the outbreak will likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S. We are not waiting for drug and device manufacturers to report shortages to us—we are proactively reaching out to manufacturers as part of our vigilant and forward-leaning approach to identifying potential disruptions or shortages. The FDA has dedicated additional resources to review and coordinate data to better identify any potential vulnerabilities to the U.S. medical product sector, specifically from this outbreak. We have been in contact with hundreds of manufacturers of human and animal drugs and medical devices, as well as syncing up with global regulators, like the European Medicines Agency, to assess and monitor for indications and early warning signs of potential manufacturing discontinuances or interruptions due to the outbreak. It’s worth noting that there are no vaccines, gene therapies, or blood derivatives licensed by the FDA that are manufactured in China. Raw materials used in manufacturing do come from China and other locations in Southeast Asia and we are in contact with biologics manufacturers to gauge any supply concerns regarding raw materials. This remains an evolving and very dynamic situation with respect to potential shortages. We are tracking reports of increased ordering of some essential medical devices through distributors, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g. respirators and surgical gowns, gloves and masks). If a potential shortage or disruption of medical products is identified by the FDA, we will use all available tools to react swiftly and mitigate the impact to U.S. patients and health care professionals. These tools include closely working with manufacturers and expediting review of alternate supply to prevent shortages, among other measures, with the common goal of minimizing any negative impact to public health in America. The FDA will continue to closely monitor the domestic and global supply chain during this evolving situation. Should the Agency be alerted to a potential shortage of a critical medical product, we will be as transparent as possible in sharing updates as they develop. Protecting the safety and security of the medical product supply chain is one of the FDA’s highest priorities. FDA inspections are used as part of our commitment to the supply chain and are currently continuing as normal except in China consistent with the State Department Travel warning. Any travel to China which is deemed to be mission-critical is being assessed on a case-by-case basis in close coordination with HHS and the State Department. We will revisit this approach and adjust as necessary as this outbreak continues to unfold. Under the authorities Congress has given the Agency, we implement a risk-based model to identify firms for inspection. The FDA prioritizes for inspection facilities deemed as higher-risk based on specific, defined criteria. These criteria can include inherent product risk. For example, a manufacturing facility that makes sterile injectable drug products will have a higher inherent product risk than a facility that makes oral capsules. As part of our risk-based model, we also consider patient exposure, as the more products a facility manufactures, the more likely a patient is to encounter products made at the facility. We also weigh factors in inspection history, a facility that has not met established quality standards when previously inspected is considered higher risk than those that have met standards in the past. In addition, we will consider signals and events of concern, such as product recalls or manufacturer or patient reports of quality problems associated with a facility, which increase the risk score when compared with facilities that have fewer or no such signals or events. In general, the FDA conducts approximately 500 inspections per year in China with the majority of these inspections being for drugs, foods and medical devices. The FDA is not currently conducting inspections in China due to the State Department warning advising against travel to China. For the month of February, the FDA identified all scheduled inspections in China, and they were either postponed or the agency was able to utilize other information to inform decisions allowing the products to enter our U.S. market. Of these , approximately 90% were routine surveillance inspections in China and the remaining for-cause inspections scheduled for February were able to be postponed after reviewing all available information and analyzing on a case-by- case basis. Routine surveillance inspections have a different public health consideration than a for-cause inspection in which a serious concern has been identified requiring more timely follow up by the Agency, and the timing of these inspections is further determined on a case-by-case basis as informed by the risks the issue poses to American patients and consumers. I can also share that the majority of routine surveillance inspections in China scheduled for March are for medical products and at this time are expected to be conducted at a later date. We will continue to closely monitor the situation in China so that as the situation improves, we will be prepared to resume routine inspections as soon as feasible. The robust and multi-layered compliance process at the FDA is helping to protect American patients and consumers even though we are not able to conduct inspections in China at this time. It’s important to note that the FDA is operating in an elevated status to swiftly respond to any new data that may require adjustments to our current risk model. And, as we have noted, along with our U.S. government partners – this is a dynamic situation that we are closely monitoring and will remain vigilant in this critical work. The FDA’s risk-based framework is integral in helping the agency to make data-driven decisions and provides our inspection and compliance programs with the flexibility needed to help ensure that they are able to prioritize any facilities in the U.S. or abroad that are identified as having a higher risk profile. Congress had the foresight of adopting risk-based inspections for the agency as part of efforts to modernize the FDA’s framework for inspections, including enhancements that were enacted as part of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Inspections are one of many tools that the Agency uses to inform our risk strategy for imported FDA-regulated products and to help prevent products that do not meet the FDA’s standards from entering the U.S. market. Others tools include: import alerts, increased import sampling and screening, requesting records, in advance or in lieu of an inspection - firms may elect to provide this voluntarily to allow the FDA to make approval decisions, evaluation of previous FDA inspections history to determine if this information would suffice in lieu of an inspection, as well as relying on a firm’s previous compliance history and information from foreign governments with which we have mutual recognition agreements as part of our Agency’s risk-based approach to ensuring quality, as well as compliance with applicable FDA requirements. This process has a number of layers in place and is not solely reliant upon on boots on-the-ground inspections. Firms and individuals who manufacture and sell FDA-regulated products are responsible for ensuring the quality of their products. The FDA can pursue regulatory and enforcement action, such as warning letters, seizures, or injunctions, against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law. While the outbreak is impacting our ability to conduct inspections in China, it’s important to underscore that the FDA’s regular risk-based process of surveillance testing of imported products, including those from China, which is based on a number of factors, continues. Fortunately, at this time, we are not seeing the impacts of this outbreak resulting in an increased risk for American consumers from imported products. Furthermore, the FDA Fraud Team monitors  on-line products promoted with claims to prevent, treat, mitigate or cure 19-nCoV (or coronavirus, in general). We will continue to assess the need for additional examinations or analytical testing on FDA-regulated products from China as a result of the outbreak, and we will continue to look at inspections on a case-by-case basis. All products offered for entry into the U.S., including items for personal use, are subject to the regulatory requirement U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP refers FDA-regulated products to the FDA for review. Products considered higher-risk and entry submissions with incomplete or inaccurate information are flagged for manual review by the FDA to determine the admissibility of the product. All imported shipments of FDA-regulated products, including those from China, are then reviewed by the FDA and must comply with the same standards as domestic products. During the , the imported products must be held and may not be distributed into U.S. commerce until the FDA has determined their admissibility. At this time, the FDA continues to review products imported from China using our routine process and has not determined that additional measures are needed to protect public health. If necessary, the agency can utilize the tools noted above, including increased import screening. Again, we want to reassure the public that at this time there is no evidence that food or food packaging have been associated with transmission and no reason to be concerned. Further, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods, including food and drugs for humans and pets, and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. associated with imported goods. We have established a cross-agency task force dedicated to closely monitoring for fraudulent products and false product claims related to COVID-19 and we have already reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring their online marketplaces for fraudulent products with coronavirus and other pathogen claims. Products sold are subject to FDA investigation and potential enforcement action if they claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19 and have not been evaluated by the agency for that intended use. The task force has already worked with retailers to remove more than a dozen of these types of product listings online. Several have already responded that they plan to monitor for coronavirus claims. The Agency is committed to taking action to prevent unscrupulous actors from marketing unlawful products related to this outbreak. A key focus area for the FDA is helping to expedite the development and availability of medical products needed to diagnose, treat and prevent this disease. We’re committed to help foster the development of safe and effective medical countermeasures as quickly as possible to protect public health, and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests for this novel virus. Last week, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to enable immediate use of a diagnostic test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, facilitating the ability for this test to be used in CDC-qualified labs. We have also developed an EUA review template for tests to detect the virus, which outlines the data requirements for a Pre-EUA package, that is available to developers upon request. To date, we have shared the EUA review template with more than 50 developers who have expressed interest in developing diagnostics for this virus. The FDA is closely monitoring the outbreak and collaborating with our interagency partners, international partners, and medical product developers and manufacturers to help advance response efforts to combat this virus. As the world responds to this public health emergency, I am grateful to the FDA staff who are working around the clock, in addition to our other mission-critical work at the Agency, to help mitigate this outbreak as swiftly as possible. You have my commitment that we will continue to stay vigilant on all fronts to protect the public health—at home and abroad--during this critical time. We are committed to continuing to update the public as we have further updates on the FDA’s vital work in this area. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Treatment for Group of Progressive Interstitial Lung Diseases", "date": "March 09, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ofev (nintedanib) oral capsules to treat patients with chronic fibrosing (scarring) interstitial lung diseases (ILD) with a progressive phenotype (trait). It is the first FDA-approved treatment for this group of fibrosing lung diseases that worsen over time. Chronic fibrosing ILD with a progressive phenotype encompasses a group of fibrotic lung diseases caused by different underlying diseases or conditions, including autoimmune ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Characteristics of chronic fibrosing ILD include lung scarring and rapid disease progression, as assessed through worsening lung function tests, symptoms and/or imaging. Progressive lung scarring leads to breathlessness and respiratory failure. Lung function declines over time among these patients and can be debilitating and life-threatening. Ofev’s safety and effectiveness to treat chronic fibrosing ILD with a progressive phenotype in adults was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 663 adults. The mean age of patients was 66 years and more patients were male (54%) than female. The primary test for effectiveness was the forced vital capacity, which is a measure of lung function. It is defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. In the 52-week period, patients received either 150 milligrams of Ofev twice a day or a placebo. After 52 weeks, people who received Ofev had less lung function decline compared to those on the placebo. The most common side effects reported in the Ofev clinical trial were diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, liver problems, decreased appetite, headache and weight loss. Ofev is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic (liver) impairment. Elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury and gastrointestinal disorders have occurred among people taking Ofev. It may also cause embryo-fetal toxicity that can result in fetal harm, arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots), bleeding and gastrointestinal perforation (hole formation). P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitor drugs, including ketoconazole and erythromycin, may increase nintedanib exposure, and patients taking these inhibitors with Ofev should be closely monitored. Ofev received designation, meaning the agency plans to take action on the application within six months because the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. It also received , which is designed to expedite the development and review of certain drugs intended to treat a serious condition. Ofev was previously approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function among patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. The FDA granted the approval of Ofev to treat ILD with a progressive phenotype to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

{"title": "FDA Approves Three Drugs for Nonprescription Use Through Rx-to-OTC Switch Process", "date": "February 14, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three drugs for nonprescription, or over-the-counter (OTC), use through a process called a prescription (Rx)-to-OTC switch. The FDA approved Voltaren Arthritis Pain (diclofenac sodium topical gel, 1%) for the temporary relief of arthritis pain;  Pataday Twice Daily Relief (olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution/drops, 0.1%) for the temporary relief of itchy and red eyes due to pollen, ragweed, grass, animal hair or dander; and Pataday Once Daily Relief (olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution/drops, 0.2%) for the temporary relief of itchy eyes due to pollen, ragweed, grass, animal hair or dander, for nonprescription use. The process of changing the status of a drug from prescription to nonprescription is called an Rx-to-OTC switch. It is usually initiated by the manufacturer of the prescription drug. For a drug to switch to nonprescription status, the data provided must demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective for use in self-medication as directed in proposed labeling. The manufacturer must show that consumers can understand how to use the drug safely and effectively without the supervision of a healthcare professional. Voltaren Arthritis Pain is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation. This product, previously referred to as Voltaren Gel 1%, was first approved by the FDA in 2007 as a prescription drug and was indicated for the relief of the pain of osteoarthritis of joints responsive to topical treatment, in particular, the joints of the hands, knees and feet. It has not been shown to work for strains, sprains, bruises or sports injuries. Voltaren Arthritis Pain is intended for the temporary relief of joint pain due to the most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis, which increases with age, affects millions of people in the U.S., and can generally be self-diagnosed. Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more of your joints. Symptoms of arthritis include pain, swelling, stiffness, and difficulty moving a joint. Voltaren Arthritis Pain is not for immediate relief and may take up to 7 days to work. Consumers should stop use and seek medical attention if their arthritis pain is not improved in 7 days or they need to use the product for more than 21 days. The active ingredient in Voltaren Arthritis Pain, diclofenac, may cause a severe allergic reaction, especially in people allergic to aspirin. If an allergic reaction occurs, consumers are advised to stop use and seek medical care immediately. Liver damage may occur if this product is used more or longer than directed or when using other products containing diclofenac. This product contains an NSAID, which may cause severe stomach bleeding. NSAIDS, except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if consumers use more than directed or for longer than directed. If pregnant or breastfeeding, consumers should talk to a health care professional about use. This product should not be used during the last 3 months of pregnancy unless the consumer is definitely directed to do so by a doctor because diclofenac may cause problems in the unborn child or complications during the delivery. Pataday Twice Daily Relief was first approved by the FDA in 1996 under the name Patanol as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (referring to ocular redness and itching due to allergies). Pataday – now Pataday Once Daily Relief – was first approved by the FDA in 2004 as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. These drugs are mast cell stabilizers, which work by preventing the release of histamine and therefore prevent or control allergic disorders. Ocular itching caused by allergens is a common ailment in the U.S., affecting millions of people. Consumers are advised to stop use and talk to their health care professional if they experience eye pain, changes in vision, increased redness of the eye, worsening of itching or itching lasting for more than 72 hours. All three products will be marketed in the U.S. as nonprescription drugs and will no longer be available as prescription drugs. Consumers should read and follow the Drug Facts labels for the nonprescription products. Patients who currently take prescription versions of these products and have questions about the Rx-to-OTC switch should talk to their health care professional. The FDA granted the approval of nonprescription Voltaren Arthritis Pain to GlaxoSmithKline plc. The FDA granted the approvals of nonprescription Pataday Twice Daily Relief and Pataday Once Daily Relief to Alcon.

{"title": "FDA Takes Action with Indian Government to Protect Consumers From Illicit Medical Products ", "date": "February 18, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced that its first bilateral enforcement operation with the Government of India, stopped approximately 500 shipments of illicit, and potentially dangerous, unapproved prescription drugs and combination medical devices from reaching American consumers over the course of an operation that took place in January. Operation Broadsword targeted packages entering the U.S. through an International Mail Facility (IMF) from Jan. 28 through Jan. 30. The operation was a collaboration between the FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of Criminal Investigations, Forensic Chemistry Center and Division of Northern Border Imports along with the Government of India’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. During Operation Broadsword, investigators from both governments examined more than 800 shipments, which identified approximately 50 different FDA-regulated products, including medications intended to treat and or mitigate serious diseases, such as various forms of cancer and HIV. Many of the shipments, which included opioid drugs products, had been transshipped through third-party countries to conceal their point of origin and avoid detection. Health risks are further compounded when products are sent through such third-party countries, which undermines protections afforded via regulated pharmaceutical supply chains. The FDA believes international law enforcement cooperation is essential in the age of interconnected regulatory frameworks and systems of distribution. In September 2019, a senior-level FDA delegation traveled to India for the purpose of strengthening bilateral engagement. A series of stakeholder meetings—coordinated and facilitated by the India Office of the FDA’s Office of Global Policy and Strategy—were held at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi as well as with the government of India’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, and the Central Drug Standard Control Organization in support of an ongoing bilateral initiative to combat public health and safety-based crime. Each day across the U.S., nine IMFs receive mail from more than 180 countries, and it is part of the FDA’s mission to inspect, detect and intercept illegal products, including those that are unapproved, counterfeit and/or potentially dangerous, such as illicit opioid products, counterfeit prescription drugs, medical devices, over-the-counter products, and products labeled as dietary supplements that may contain harmful ingredients. In fiscal year 2019, the FDA screened approximately 25,200 parcels, containing more than 41,000 products combined at all of its IMF facilities. The FDA detained more than 38,000 of those products, and expects to ultimately destroy more than 17,000 of those products as drugs subject to the FDA’s Patients who buy prescription medicines from illegal online pharmacies may be putting their health at risk because the products, while being passed off as authentic, may be counterfeit, contaminated, expired, or otherwise unsafe. In addition to health risks posed by these products, illegal online pharmacies can pose other risks to consumers. These include the risk of credit card fraud, identity theft and computer viruses. The FDA provides consumers with information to identify an illegal online pharmacy and information on how to buy medicine safely online through . Consumers are encouraged to online to FDA.

{"title": "Insulin Gains New Pathway to Increased Competition", "date": "March 23, 2020", "contents": " Today is a historic day and a landmark moment for patients with diabetes and other serious medical conditions, as insulin and certain other biologic drugs . This regulatory transition, mandated by Congress and implemented by the FDA, is incredibly important for patients. For the first time, a pathway will be open for products that are proposed as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, the transitioned products. The availability of safe and effective biosimilar and interchangeable versions of these treatments, including insulin, is expected to increase patient access, adding more choices and potentially reducing costs of these vital therapies. Biologic drugs, including insulin, treat some of the most serious diseases and conditions. The drugs transitioning today are used in the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of many of these conditions, including diabetes, respiratory distress syndrome, fertility conditions, Cushing’s syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, Gaucher disease and many more. But these life-saving drugs often also contribute significantly to drug costs. Historically, it was more difficult to develop generic versions of these drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act due to scientific challenges and limitations on the scope of data that can be relied upon in a generic drug application. This framework contributed to limited competition for these drugs, resulting in fewer choices and higher prices for patients. Today’s transition opens a new pathway for manufacturers to seek FDA approval of and bring biosimilar and interchangeable versions of insulin and other transitioning products to market, facilitating greater competition. When Congress created the biosimilars pathway in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, Congress also created a 10-year timeline for stakeholders to prepare for the regulatory transition of biological products that were historically regulated under the FD&C Act; now that the day has arrived, the FDA can begin receiving applications for proposed biosimilars to these licensed transition biological products, including insulin products that millions of Americans rely on every day to maintain stable blood glucose. Approved biosimilars will be able to come to market, where there is incredible potential to reduce health care costs, as has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. On the generic drugs side, we know from an FDA that even with one generic on the market, prices are 31 to 39% lower than before the generic competition. Similarly, biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products. Over the last 10 years, the FDA has worked hard to establish a strong framework for the biosimilar and interchangeable regulatory pathway, as well as providing clarity to all involved on what the transition means to them and how it may affect our many stakeholders. Our was established to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process and to maximize scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar product development community. Through this action plan, we’ve worked to support robust competition from biosimilars, including supporting market competition and providing clear direction to industry on many relevant topics leading up to the transition. In just the last six months, we’ve taken several important actions on biosimilars, and in preparation for this transition, including partnering with the Federal Trade Commission regarding efforts to address false or misleading statements and promotional communications by biologic product manufacturers, deter anti-competitive business practices and support a competitive marketplace for biosimilars; issuing a final rule, draft guidance and final guidances to provide clarity to industry; providing information for patients and health care providers about what the transition means to them; and expanding and digitizing the FDA’s database of FDA-licensed biological products, otherwise known as the Purple Book. These actions, among the many others we’ve taken in this space, reflect the tireless work of our dedicated workforce to ensure a smooth regulatory transition and provide clarity for biosimilar developers. We stand ready to review incoming applications from industry. We will also continue to work closely with those interested in producing biosimilar and interchangeable products to support efficiency in development, review and approval of these medicines. Today is a milestone for the future of insulin and other important treatments – potentially a new era of proposed biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. We expect this regulatory transition to enable a vibrant competitive market for transitioning products, ultimately empowering patients by increasing choices and potentially lowering prices of safe, effective, high-quality medications.

The FDA issued a for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) procedures. The FDA has issued a safety communication about the potential for transmission of the COVID-19 virus through FMT, a procedure that delivers human donor stool into the colon of a patient to treat infection in patients that have not responded to standard therapies. The FDA also updated its regarding specimen collection for COVID-19 testing. Based on available data, FDA believes that, for symptomatic patients, nasal swabs could be used that access just the front of the nose rather than the depth of the nasal cavity. This would provide COVID-19 testing that is more comfortable for patients, allows self-collection of specimens at collection sites, and that can be performed with a simpler and more readily available swab. The FDA Oncology Center of Excellence issued a recognizing that patients with cancer, due to potentially being immunocompromised, are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, and the Center is working to address critical needs of patients with cancer and their health care providers. Diagnostics update: In certain emergencies, the FDA can often quickly issue an for diagnostic tests based on FDA’s rolling review of data and where the request meets certain criteria. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 160 test developers who have said they will be submitting applications to make tests that detect the virus.

{"title": "FDA Works to Ensure Smooth Regulatory Transition of Insulin and Other Biological Products", "date": "February 20, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took additional steps to ensure a smooth regulatory transition aimed at increasing patient access to insulin products used daily by millions of Americans to maintain stable blood glucose levels, as well as certain other biological products set to transition regulatory pathways in March. Today’s actions include publishing a final rule and additional resources to provide useful information to stakeholders, including industry, patients and health care providers. On March 23, 2020, an application for a biological product approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), including applications for insulins and other biological products, will be deemed to be a license for the product under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. This will, for the first time, enable submission of applications for products that are proposed as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, the transitioned products. As such, the transition of insulin products from approved drug applications to deemed biological product licenses will open up those products to potential biosimilar and interchangeable competition. The availability of approved biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products is expected to increase patient access, adding more choices and potentially reducing costs of insulin products. The FDA has taken many steps to date to establish the framework for this new pathway, including issuing the 2018 , which aims to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process and to maximize scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar product development community. The agency has accomplished many of the projects outlined in the Biosimilars Action Plan and is continuing our work on others to enhance patient access to needed medicines in the period leading up to the transition. Today’s actions, which are key to the FDA’s action plan, include the publication of a and frequently asked questions documents for explaining more about the transition. The final rule, “Definition of the Term ‘Biological Product,’” amends the FDA’s regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to codify the FDA’s interpretation of the statutory term “protein.” Under this interpretation, the term “protein” means any alpha amino acid polymer with a specific, defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size. This interpretation is intended to clarify the statutory framework under which such products are regulated. The FDA’s interpretation of the transition provision of the BPCI Act is intended to balance innovation and competition and facilitate the development and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products. Getting safe and effective biosimilar and interchangeable products approved will help ensure that the market is competitive, and patients may have more affordable access to the treatments they need. The agency also issued two frequently asked questions documents, one for patients and another for health care providers, with information on what the transition means to them. These documents clarify that the transition should not affect existing prescribing or dispensing practices and that patients should not notice any difference in their medications, or how they receive their medications, among other topics. The FDA continues to work diligently to ensure there is a seamless transition between regulatory pathways and that there are minimal impacts on manufacturers and patients.

The FDA is facilitating access to convalescent plasma, antibody-rich blood products that are taken from blood donated by people who have recovered from the COVID-19 virus, that could shorten the length, or lessen the severity, of the illness. The agency will be using multiple pathways to support these efforts and has wishing to study convalescent plasma for use in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections through the process of single patient emergency Investigational New Drug Applications for individual patients. The FDA also is actively engaging with researchers to discuss the possibility of collaboration on the development of a master protocol for the use of convalescent plasma, with the goal of reducing duplicative efforts. In response to this evolving public health emergency and continued filtering facepiece respirator (FFR or respirator) shortages, FDA has concluded based on the totality of scientific evidence available that certain imported disposable FFRs that are not NIOSH-approved are appropriate to protect the public health or safety (as described under section II Scope of Authorization) under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3). Under this EUA, authorized respirators listed in Exhibit 1 are authorized for use in healthcare settings by healthcare personnel (HCP) when used in accordance with CDC recommendations to prevent wearer exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates during FFR shortages resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The FDA issued a advising consumers to be beware of fraudulent coronavirus tests, vaccines and treatments. The FDA is particularly concerned that deceptive and misleading products might cause Americans to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. It’s likely that the products do not do what they claim, and the ingredients in them could cause adverse effects and could interact with, and potentially interfere with, essential medications. There are no FDA-approved products to prevent COVID-19. For example, the FDA is aware of people trying to prevent COVID-19 by taking a product called chloroquine phosphate, which is sold to treat parasites in aquarium fish. Products for veterinary use or for “research use only” may have adverse effects, including serious illness and death, when taken by people. The agency warns not to take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a health care provider and obtained from legitimate sources. Diagnostics update: In certain emergencies, the FDA can often quickly issue an for diagnostic tests based on FDA’s rolling review of data and where the request meets certain criteria. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 190 test developers who have said they will be submitting applications to make tests that detect the virus. To date, 16 emergency use authorizations have been issued for nation-wide use, including today. Under our during COVID-19, the FDA has been notified by more than 65 laboratories. that includes steps the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has taken to prioritize work that advances the nation’s response during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency.

This helps veterinarians continue to care for animals while minimizing person-to-person contact between veterinary staff and the animal owner or caretaker, allowing for the social distancing that is so important in limiting the further spread of coronavirus. The FDA explained how the agency is working with experts around the world to find ways to prevent and treat COVID-19, including collaborating with international organizations to facilitate the development of a vaccine: FDA Voices: The FDA took action to increase U.S. supplies to support the U.S. response to COVID-19 by providing importing personal protective equipment and other devices. The agency is engaging with importers and others involved in the import trade community during this pandemic to facilitate the entry of needed products, including PPE, into the U.S. These instructions to importers clarify the types of PPE that can be imported without engaging with FDA. They also include information about the type of information importers can submit to facilitate their entries. The FDA provided an update, FDA , to explain that the U.S. food supply remains safe for both people and animals. There is no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Additionally, overall, retail supply chains remain strong, and the FDA is working with food manufacturers and grocery stores to closely monitor the human food supply chain for any shortages. The same is true for animal food. The FDA is monitoring the availability of foods for livestock and pets. There are no shortages, and no current disruptions in the pet and livestock food supply chain."},

This pandemic has had impacts on many of our everyday lives and professions, and during this time, we need to provide veterinarians with the latitude to expand the use of telemedicine in the care of animals, not only pets but also the animals that produce our food,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The FDA is providing flexibility that will help veterinarians maintain the health of animals during the pandemic, while allowing for the social distancing that is so important in limiting the further spread of coronavirus disease across the country and the world.” The agency intends to temporarily suspend enforcement of portions of the federal veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) requirements relevant to certain FDA regulations. The VCPR is the professional relationship between the veterinarian, client (e.g., animal owner or caretaker), and the animal patient(s). The federal VCPR definition requires that veterinarians physically examine animal patients and/or make medically appropriate and timely visits to the location where the animal(s) are kept. Therefore, the federal VCPR definition cannot be met solely through telemedicine. In order to help veterinarians utilize telemedicine to address animal health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA generally does not intend to enforce the animal examination and premises visit portion of the VCPR requirements relevant to the FDA regulations governing . This will allow veterinarians to prescribe drugs in an extralabel manner or authorize the use of VFD drugs without direct examination of or making visits to their patients, which will limit human-to-human interaction and potential spread of COVID-19 in the community. For example, the owner of a sick dog could share a video with a veterinarian. If necessary, the veterinarian could then prescribe a drug not approved for use in dogs or for that illness (extralabel use). As another example, a veterinarian could remotely examine and diagnose a group of food-producing animals with a disease, and then authorize the use of VFD drugs in the animals’ feed. Although the FDA intends to temporarily suspend certain federal VCPR requirements, veterinarians still need to consider state VCPR requirements that may exist in their practice area.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Provides Updated Guidance to Address the Urgent Need for Blood During the Pandemic", "date": "April 02, 2020", "contents": " As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ongoing commitment to fight the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, today the agency issued guidance for immediate implementation to address the urgent and immediate need for blood and blood components. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges to the U.S. blood supply. Donor centers have experienced a dramatic reduction in donations due to the implementation of social distancing and the cancellation of blood drives. Maintaining an adequate blood supply is vital to public health. Blood donors help patients of all ages – accident and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients and those battling cancer and other life-threatening conditions. The American Red Cross estimates that every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood. People who donate blood are part of our critical infrastructure industries. More donations are needed at this time and we hope people will continue to take the time to donate blood. We have also encouraged, and continue to encourage, state and local governments to take into account the essential nature of donating blood - and that it can be done safely and consistently within social distancing guidelines - when considering travel and business restrictions, and we encourage them to communicate that to their citizens. At the FDA, we want to do , which includes revisiting and updating some of our existing policies to help ensure we have an adequate blood supply, while still protecting the safety of our nation’s blood supply. Based on recently completed studies and epidemiologic data, the FDA has concluded that current policies regarding certain donor eligibility criteria can be modified without compromising the safety of the blood supply. Therefore, the FDA is revising recommendations in several guidances regarding blood donor eligibility. These changes are being put forth for immediate implementation and are expected to remain in place after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, with any appropriate changes based on comments we receive and our experience implementing the guidances. At this time, the alternatives to certain donor eligibility requirements being provided generally will apply only for the duration of the declared pandemic. Among others, the FDA is making the following changes, for immediate implementation, to the December 2015 guidance: The FDA is making the following changes, for immediate implementation, to the August 2013 guidance: The FDA is finalizing the January 2020 draft guidance, which includes the following change from the previous guidance: To help address this critical need, the FDA is also regarding blood donor eligibility for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Blood establishments are not required to implement the changes in the FDA recommendations or the alternative procedures. We expect that the updated guidance and alternative procedures will help increase the number of donations moving forward, while helping to ensure adequate protections for donor health and maintaining a safe blood supply for patients. We believe these updated recommendations will have a significant and positive impact on our blood supply. As noted above, the changes being announced to the HIV, vCJD and malaria guidances are being put forth for immediate implementation. The updated recommendations in these guidances are based on data and analysis that the FDA believes are applicable to circumstances outside of (and after) the COVID-19 pandemic and reflect the agency’s current thinking on this issue. These recommendations are expected to remain in place after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, with any appropriate changes based on comments we receive and our experience implementing the guidances. The FDA will provide notification when the alternative procedures are no longer in effect. The FDA will monitor these changes in policy, alongside the National Institutes of Health’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and major blood partners to ensure the continued safety of the blood supply.

The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. For male donors who would have been deferred for having sex with another man: the agency is changing the recommended deferral period from 12 months to 3 months. For female donors who would have been deferred for having sex with a man who had sex with another man: the agency is changing the recommended deferral period from 12 months to 3 months. For those with recent tattoos and piercings: the agency is changing the recommended deferral period from 12 months to 3 months. For those who have traveled to malaria-endemic areas (and are residents of malaria non-endemic countries): the agency is changing the recommended deferral period from 12 months to 3 months. In addition, the guidance provides notice of an alternate procedure that permits the collection of blood and blood components from such donors without a deferral period, provided the blood components are pathogen-reduced using an FDA-approved pathogen reduction device. For those who spent time in certain European countries or on military bases in Europe who were previously considered to have been exposed to a potential risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the agency is eliminating the recommended deferrals and is recommending allowing reentry of these donors."},

{"title": "FDA Continues to Support Transparency and Collaboration in Drug Approval Process as the Clinical Data Summary Pilot Concludes", "date": "March 26, 2020", "contents": " As our society becomes more global, it has become increasingly clear that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration needs to take a more collaborative approach to our drug approval process. Today, drugs that are approved by the FDA to be marketed in the United States are developed both in and out of the United States. Of the 46,391 participants in the that supported the 48 novel drugs approved by the FDA in 2019, 60% of the participants were located outside the U.S., showing the international nature of drug development. While many clinical trials have an international component, the marketing authorization, including the application and review process, varies from country to country. What also varies is what information is made available to researchers, industry and the public about the scientific basis for each drug approval. Regulatory agencies in different countries are governed by different applicable laws and have their own transparency standards. To realize the benefits and opportunities provided by a more transparent drug approval process, we must first identify, and address, some of the challenges facing the global drug development community. The FDA is committed to improving collaboration efforts with drug-approving regulatory agencies in other countries, and to increasing transparency related to the scientific basis for drug approval decisions. The FDA is working on multiple fronts to support these efforts and apply best practices. In 2018, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the FDA implemented the , a voluntary pilot program designed to evaluate whether disclosing certain information included within clinical study reports (CSRs) following approval of a new drug application improves public access to drug approval information. When a drug is approved, the FDA releases certain information that the agency used when reviewing the new drug application, including summaries written by our medical reviewers that capture their assessment of the data, the approved labeling or other requirements, and other important, relevant data supporting safe and effective use. This information is included in our drug approvals database, . These summaries provide important context on the basis for our approval decisions, but they are packaged in a format that can sometimes make it difficult for external audiences to extract and understand the detailed clinical evidence that supported the FDA’s approval decisions. The pilot aimed to test a new process for selecting, redacting and posting on the FDA’s public website summaries of information that the agency uses in making marketing approval decisions. The overarching goal of the pilot was to assess the feasibility of improving access to summary clinical trial information about approved drug products for the drug research and development community, medical researchers and the public. With this pilot, we aimed to respond to stakeholders’ requests for greater transparency in the drug approval process and more access to usable information and evaluate whether disclosing certain information improved public access to drug approval information. After receiving useful internal and external knowledge and feedback as part of the pilot program, we have decided to conclude the pilot. In the interest of increasing transparency in the drug approval process, the agency has learned many best practices through the pilot that we intend to apply to future efforts. For example, we found that there are significant inefficiencies in having multiregional disclosure requirements relating to often identical clinical data summaries. These inefficiencies multiply the transactional, administrative and redaction (because there are differing regional disclosure standards) costs, whether the costs are incurred by industry or a regional regulatory authority. These costs create barriers to programs to disclose clinical trial information which might be reduced if a centralized or regional approach could be achieved. Through the CSR pilot, we also identified a potential approach that could facilitate a harmonized system for disclosing study reports. The general framework of this approach includes the following principles: A centralized international library, managed by an independent organization, where information is made available to the public rather than each regulatory authority having its own system. MedDRA.org is an example of a successful model of international harmonization through use of an independent organization. An on-demand system, where sponsors would automatically publish a limited number of documents in the international library, such as the summaries of clinical information and an index of study reports, should be considered. The public could request study reports of interest, and the sponsor would then prepare the report, protocol and statistical plan and add it to the library. Anonymization and disclosure standards would be established to satisfy the requirements of the participating regional regulatory authorities. There are already ongoing independent efforts to establish anonymization standards and best practices (e.g., A sponsor could have the choice of committing to use the international library system to disclose study reports, protocols and statistical plans for all marketing applications or to follow the requirements of each region where they apply for authorization to market products. While increasing international harmonization efforts to share clinical study reports is a long-term goal, in the short term we are assessing how the lessons learned during the pilot can be applied in our modernization efforts. For example, CDER’s Office of New Drugs, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, may consider whether posting of certain portions of the clinical summary data would improve transparency and enhance our integrated review activities. As the pilot concludes, our harmonization and transparency efforts will continue. The FDA continues to invest in our work with our international partners. This work brings together regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of drug development. We plan to keep stakeholders informed of any future projects in these areas, as appropriate, and we sincerely thank those who took the time to comment on and participate in the pilot. We will continue to look for ways to improve harmonization and transparency in the drug approval process as we move forward with our modernization efforts.

During the COVID-19 emergency, the DSCSA requirements related to certain product tracing and product identification activities, and wholesale distribution, do not apply to qualifying distribution activities. This flexibility balances the need for effective distribution of products under emergency conditions with protecting consumers from exposure to products that may be counterfeit, stolen or otherwise harmful. Diagnostics Update to Date During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 380 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for tests that detect the virus. To date, the FDA has issued 53 individual for test kit manufacturers and laboratories. In addition, 23 authorized tests have been added to the EUA letter of authorization for high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has been notified that more than 235 laboratories have begun testing under the policies set forth in our COVID-19 Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency Guidance.

While there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19, the investigational drug was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some patients. “FDA’s emergency authorization of remdesivir, two days after the National Institutes of Health’s clinical trial showed promising results, is a significant step forward in battling COVID-19 and another example of the Trump Administration moving as quickly as possible to use science to save lives,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “NIH, FDA, and scientists across America and around the world have worked tirelessly with patients to get us this new potential treatment for COVID-19. The seamless cooperation between government and private industry under the President’s all-of-America approach to COVID-19 is getting treatment options to patients in record time.” The emergency use authorization allows for remdesivir to be distributed in the U.S. and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. Severe disease is defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator. “From day one, the FDA has been committed to expediting the development and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments. Today’s action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “There’s tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our , the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts.” Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating COVID-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug’s use. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using remdesivir in treating COVID-19 be made available to , including dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects of remdesivir include: increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and shivering. Following the declaration by the Secretary of HHS that circumstances exist justifying the emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an emergency use authorization to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks of any unproven products with any known or potential benefits of making them available during the emergency. The EUA was issued to Gilead Sciences Inc. The FDA previously allowed for study of the investigational drug under clinical trials, as well as expanded access use for individual patients and through a multi-patient expanded access program coordinated by Gilead. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

A new FDA Voices, , explains today’s from March 16, 2020 on antibody tests for COVID-19. The FDA will continue to take steps to appropriately balance assurances that an antibody test is accurate and reliable with timely access to such tests as the continually evolving circumstances and public health needs warrant.

There are currently no FDA-approved drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. Consumers can visit to learn about how to safely buy medicine online. The FDA authorized the first serology, or antibody, where the results of a new independent validation effort by the U.S. Government provided the scientific evidence used to support the authorization. The testing was performed at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI). The results are among the first to come from a collaborative effort by the FDA, NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to evaluate certain serological tests. Essential samples and materials used in the evaluation were provided by the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Mount Sinai Health System, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, including members of the Departments of Microbiology and Pathology, and the Vitalant Research Institute.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Federal judge enters temporary injunction against Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, preventing sale of Chlorine Dioxide Products Equivalent to Industrial Bleach to Treat COVID-19", "date": "April 17, 2020", "contents": " A federal court has entered a temporary injunction against the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (Genesis) and four individuals associated with the entity requiring them to immediately stop distributing its “Miracle Mineral Solution” (MMS), an unproven and potentially harmful treatment offered for sale to treat Coronavirus, which includes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and many other diseases. In granting the government’s request for relief, the court found that the United States has demonstrated that Genesis and the associated individuals named in the injunction are violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) by unlawfully distributing MMS, an unapproved new drug and misbranded drug. When combined with the included activator MMS has a chlorine dioxide content equivalent to industrial bleach. The court also found that there is a danger that the defendants will continue violating the law without the temporary restraining order. The FDA, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), previously issued a to Genesis and the FDA has numerous times over the past decade not to purchase or drink chlorine dioxide products such as MMS sold as medical treatments. The FDA and FTC requested that the company respond within 48 hours describing the specific steps it has taken to correct the violations. In response to the warning letter, the defendants made clear that they had no intention of taking corrective action and would continue to sell MMS in violation of the law. This is especially concerning to the agency as the FDA has received reports of people experiencing serious adverse events, including respiratory failure, life-threatening low blood pressure, acute liver failure and QT prolongation after drinking certain chlorine dioxide products. The FDA has not approved Genesis’s product for any use, despite the defendants’ claims that these products can be used to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent diseases such as COVID-19, Alzheimer’s, autism, brain cancer, multiple sclerosis and HIV/AIDS. Claims made on the Genesis websites, which provide a link to purchase MMS, include, “The Coronavirus is curable, you believe that? . . . MMS will kill it.” The agency is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting the safety or efficacy of MMS to treat any disease and there are no approved drug applications in effect for the defendants’ MMS. As a result of these violations, today, U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, entered the temporary restraining order against Genesis and the individual defendants Mark Grenon, Joseph Grenon, Jordan Grenon and Jonathan Grenon until May 1st, 2020. There will be a hearing on the government’s request to extend the injunction on May 1st, 2020. The complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), against the Bradenton, Fla. seller and the seller’s most responsible individuals, seeks to restrain and enjoin all defendants from labeling, holding and distributing unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, including MMS, in interstate commerce on a permanent basis. The FDA requested the DOJ to bring this case on behalf of the U.S. Government. The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against Genesis. The FDA is particularly concerned that products that claim to cure, treat or prevent serious diseases like COVID-19 may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. The FDA reminds the public to seek medical help from their health care providers. Additionally, children are a vulnerable population that may be at greater risk for adverse reactions from consuming chlorine dioxide products. The FDA encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of COVID-19 products to the The FDA continues to monitor social media, online marketplaces and incoming complaints to help ensure that sellers do not continue to sell fraudulent products related to COVID-19.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Serological Test Validation and Education Efforts", "date": "April 18, 2020", "contents": " Every step we have taken as part of our approach to COVID-19 testing has been a careful balancing of risks and benefits in order to meet the urgent public health needs as we combat this new pathogen. We have moved quickly and thoughtfully, and we are continuing to learn and adapt based on the real-world experience and data we’re seeing. In the meantime, frontline health care workers who are making life-and-death decisions every day in their fight against this novel coronavirus need to have all the information possible to make educated decisions about which test to use to help identify individuals who have developed an immune response to the virus. We are committed to providing as up-to-date information as possible to support their heroic efforts. As the country starts to see positive signs that the mitigation efforts, like stay-at-home orders and social distancing, are working in our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the question of when we can return to work and resume our normal activities is one of the most critical issues facing our nation. Antibody tests – also known as serological tests – may have the potential to play a role in this complex calculation. Results from these tests can help identify who has been infected and developed antibodies that may protect from future infection as well as identify those still at risk. Results can also help inform who may qualify to donate blood that can be used to manufacture , an investigational product for use with those who are seriously ill from COVID-19. Today, given the active dialogue about serological tests that are currently on the market, and their significance in the nation’s response efforts, we’d like to provide further details about our thinking on these tests and our approach to making accurate and reliable serology tests widely available, while also protecting Americans from tests marketed with false or unsubstantiated claims. First, we continue to provide the opportunity for interested developers to request FDA authorization through the . To date, we have already issued for serological tests, and we expect that number to continue to grow in the coming weeks. The FDA encourages developers to submit EUA requests for their tests, as an EUA will provide laboratories and providers with assurance that FDA has reviewed that test. We are working around-the-clock to review EUA submissions quickly and we continue to take steps to ensure the process is as streamlined and efficient as possible. For example, we are working on EUA Templates that laboratories and commercial manufacturers may use to facilitate the preparation and submission of an EUA request. We expect to make them available in the coming days. To enhance the U.S. Government’s ability to identify well-performing tests and inform FDA recommendations and decision making, we are collaborating with the National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a capability at NIH to evaluate serological tests for developers. This effort includes tests already available for use, as well as tests not yet on the market where additional validation data is needed to support an EUA. Performance assessments for serological tests will begin soon, and we expect to start seeing results shortly thereafter. We will review NIH’s results expeditiously, and performance results from NIH’s assessment may complement and inform the determination of whether FDA issues an EUA for a particular test. Recognizing that more flexibility was needed during a pandemic of this scale and speed, and incorporating feedback from the medical community, states and test developers, we have also provided regulatory flexibility for serological tests in an effort to provide laboratories and health care providers with early access to these tests with the understanding that the FDA had not reviewed or authorized (or “approved”) them, at least not initially, and these tests should not be used for diagnosing or excluding active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, last month, as part of our broader strategy, the FDA issued a explaining that FDA does not intend to object when developers of serological tests market or use their tests without prior FDA review where: 1) the tests are validated by the developer to determine that they are accurate and reliable, 2) notification of the developer’s validation is provided to FDA, and 3) the tests are labeled appropriately, including that they are not to be used as a sole basis for diagnosis. Our policy does not apply to at-home specimen collection or at-home testing because of the added challenges in assuring test accuracy that these pose. The policy does apply to tests that can be performed in patient care settings. Laboratories could validate tests they receive from commercial manufacturers and determine if they should be used in their facilities. Some laboratories have already done so or have developed their own serological tests. The bottom line is that FDA still expects tests to be validated even under our revised policy for tests. However, the EUA process or an evaluation by NIH supports greater confidence in test performance. Unlike a test designed to diagnose an active COVID-19 infection (specifically from the SARS-CoV-2 virus), serological tests can help identify individuals who have developed an immune response to the virus, either as part of an active infection or a prior infection. The tests detect the presence of antibodies in the blood – if antibodies are present, that indicates that the person has been exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean that person has at least some immunity to the coronavirus. In the early days of an infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected, which is why serological tests should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is still a great deal about COVID-19 immunity that we don’t yet fully understand. For example, we don’t yet know that just because someone has developed antibodies, that they are fully protected from reinfection, or how long any immunity lasts. We do expect that data from more widespread serological testing will help us track the spread of the virus nationwide and assess the impact of our public health efforts now, while also informing our COVID-19 response as we continue to move forward. Determining the next steps in our response to COVID-19 is partially dependent on an accurate assessment of our national efforts thus far, and the quality of data for making this decision is dependent on accurate testing products. All clinical tests should be validated prior to use, and this expectation is articulated in our March 16 policy. We have provided regulatory flexibility regarding the independent check by FDA for antibody tests that are limited in their clinical applications, but still expect all developers to validate their tests prior to offering them for limited clinical uses. To minimize the number of false positive results, serological tests must be well-designed to specifically identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and must not “cross-react,” or provide positive results when encountering antibodies against other respiratory viruses. Currently, we are working on several fronts to provide more clarity about which tests have received FDA review and which have not. In addition, to facilitate awareness of these serological tests, the FDA has been posting on its website the tests for which it has received a notification under this policy since mid-March. We have also to better clarify which tests have been authorized by FDA and which have not been authorized. However, some test developers have misused the serology test kit notification list to falsely claim their serological tests are FDA approved or authorized. Others have falsely claimed that their tests can diagnose COVID-19. When we become aware of these issues, we have and will continue to take appropriate action against firms making or distributing unvalidated tests or those making false claims, such as issuing Warning Letters requesting that companies stop their unlawful promotion and detaining and refusing fraudulent test kits at the border. We are sharing educational materials with state governments, hospital systems, payors, and health care professional associations to ensure they understand the potential for false-positive results in tests that have not yet been reviewed by FDA, and can make educated decisions when considering purchasing, insuring and using these tests. We have been and will continue actively engaging with the testing development community to continue to gain input and provide clarity around our processes, policies and validation efforts.

Specifically, the FDA (EUA) for the Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) COVID-19 RT-PCR Test to permit testing of samples self-collected by patients at home using LabCorp’s Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kit. “Throughout this pandemic we have been facilitating test development to ensure patients access to accurate diagnostics, which includes supporting the development of reliable and accurate at-home sample collection options,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “The FDA’s around-the-clock work since this outbreak began has resulted in the authorization of more than 50 diagnostic tests and engagement with over 350 test developers. Specifically, for tests that include home sample collection, we worked with LabCorp to ensure the data demonstrated from at-home patient sample collection is as safe and accurate as sample collection at a doctor’s office, hospital or other testing site. With this action, there is now a convenient and reliable option for patient sample collection from the comfort and safety of their home.” This reissued EUA for LabCorp’s molecular test permits testing of a sample collected from the patient’s nose using a designated self-collection kit that contains nasal swabs and saline. Once patients self-swab to collect their nasal sample, they mail their sample, in an insulated package, to a LabCorp lab for testing.  LabCorp intends to make the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor’s order, in the coming weeks. The LabCorp home self-collection kit includes a specific Q-tip-style cotton swab for patients to use to collect their sample. Due to concerns with sterility and cross-reactivity due to inherent genetic material in cotton swabs, other cotton swabs should not be used with this test at the present time. The FDA continues to work with test developers to determine whether or not Q-tip-style cotton swab can be used safely and effectively with other tests. This authorization only applies to the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test for at-home collection of nasal swab specimens using the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 home collection kit.

There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider: Diagnostics update to date: The first seller warned, , sells unapproved and misbranded herbal products for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The second seller warned, , offers unapproved and misbranded ayurvedic products including “Alpha 11” and “Alpha 21” for sale in the U.S. with misleading claims about the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The third seller warned, , offers unapproved and misbranded products including “True Viral Defense” also referred to as “Viral Defense Tincture.” The company makes misleading claims the products are safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 in people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 300 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for tests that detect the virus. To date, 34 have been issued for diagnostic tests. The FDA has been notified that more than 180 laboratories have begun testing under the policies set forth in our COVID-19 Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency Guidance. The FDA also continues to keep its up to date, including updated FAQs regarding at-home testing:"},
{"title": "FDA Approves First Therapy for Treatment of Low-Grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer", "date": "April 15, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Jelmyto (mitomycin gel), the first therapy to treat low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). Urothelial cancer is a cancer of the lining of the urinary system. While the majority of urothelial cancers occur in the bladder, UTUC corresponds to a subset of urothelial cancers that arise in the lining of the kidney or the ureter (the long, thin tube that connects that kidney to the bladder). UTUC can block the ureter or kidney, causing swelling, infections and impairment of kidney function in some patients. UTUCs can develop as low-grade or high-grade tumors. In general, low-grade tumors are not invasive and very rarely spread from the kidney or ureter. However, they often recur and management involves treating visible tumors and trying to preserve the urinary tract, as these tumors are more likely to recur in the urinary system than they are to spread. Low-grade UTUC is rare, but affects 6,000-8,000 new patients in the United States every year. Jelmyto is an alkylating drug, meaning it inhibits the transcription of DNA into RNA, stopping protein synthesis and taking away the cancer cell’s ability to multiply. The FDA approved Jelmyto based on the results of a clinical trial involving 71 patients with low-grade UTUC. These patients had never undergone treatment or had recurrent low-grade non-invasive UTUC with at least one measurable papillary tumor (a tumor shaped like a small mushroom with its stem attached to the inner lining of an organ). Patients received Jelmyto once a week for six weeks and, if assessed as a complete response (complete disappearance of the papillary tumor), monthly for up to 11 additional months. Efficacy of Jelmyto was evaluated using urine cytology (a test to look for abnormal cells in a patient’s urine), ureteroscopy (an examination of the upper urinary tract) and biopsy (if warranted) three months following the initiation of therapy. The primary endpoint was complete response at three months following initiation of therapy. A complete response was found in 41 of the 71 patients (58%) following six treatments of Jelmyto administered weekly. Durability of the effect of Jelmyto in patients with a complete response was also evaluated using urine cytology, ureteroscopy and biopsy (if warranted) every three months for a year following the initiation of therapy. Nineteen patients (46%) who achieved a complete response continued to have a complete response at the 12-month mark. Common side effects for patients taking Jelmyto were ureteric obstruction (narrowing or blockage of the ureter that may lead to excess fluid in the kidney due to a backup of urine), flank pain (pain occurring on the side of the body), urinary tract infection, hematuria (blood in the urine), renal dysfunction (inability of the kidney to function in its designed capacity), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, dysuria (painful or difficult urination) and vomiting. Jelmyto can cause serious side effects including ureteric obstruction, flank pain and urosepsis (bacteria in the bloodstream from a urinary tract infection). Patients with ureteric obstruction may require transient or long-term stents to relieve this obstruction. The obstruction may be persistent and did not resolve or did not resolve completely in 51% of patients who experienced obstruction due to Jelmyto. Jelmyto should be avoided in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (a test used to check how well the kidneys are working) of less than 30mL/min. Women who are pregnant should not take Jelmyto because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Jelmyto, and for six months following the last dose. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should also use effective contraception during treatment with Jelmyto and for three months following the last dose. The FDA granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Jelmyto was also granted designation, which expedites the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Jelmyto received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Jelmyto to UroGen Pharma, Inc.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Encourages Recovered Patients to Donate Plasma for Development of Blood-Related Therapies", "date": "April 16, 2020", "contents": " As part of the all-of-America approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been working with partners across the U.S. government, academia and industry to expedite the development and availability of critical medical products to treat this novel virus. Today, we are providing an update on one potential treatment called convalescent plasma and encouraging those who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma to help others fight this disease. Convalescent plasma is an antibody-rich product made from blood donated by people who have recovered from the disease caused by the virus. Prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from China suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19. It is important that we evaluate this potential therapy in the context of clinical trials, through expanded access, as well as facilitate emergency access for individual patients, as appropriate. The response to the agency’s national efforts to facilitate the development of and access to convalescent plasma has been tremendous. More than 1,040 sites and 950 physician investigators nationwide have signed on to participate in the expanded access protocol. A number of clinical trials are also taking place to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma and the FDA has granted numerous single patient emergency investigational new drug (eIND) applications as well. As this work moves forward, the key to ensuring the availability of convalescent plasma to those in greatest need is getting recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma. The FDA has to guide recovered COVID-19 patients to local blood or plasma collection centers to discuss their eligibility and potentially schedule an appointment to donate. The webpage also provides information for those interested in participating in the expanded access protocol, conducting clinical trials or submitting eIND applications. The American Red Cross has also set up a website for interested donors ( ) and the FDA continues to work with others in this area to help encourage additional donations. During this challenging time, many people are asking what they can do to contribute to the COVID-19 response. Those individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 could have an immediate impact in helping others who are severely ill. In fact, one donation has the potential to help up to four patients. Convalescent plasma can also be used to manufacture a biological product called hyperimmune globulin, which can similarly be used to treat patients with COVID-19. People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks can contact their local blood or plasma collection center today to schedule an appointment. We encourage individuals to consider donating and hope this information will serve as a helpful resource to facilitate this important act of kindness. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Continues to Ensure Availability of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Addresses Safety Concerns", "date": "April 27, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided an update on its efforts to ensure the availability of alcohol-based sanitizer to help meet the demand for hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the agency’s significant flexibility, more than 1,500 additional manufacturers have registered with the agency to produce hand sanitizer. At the same time, the agency is addressing safety concerns related to products being sold that are not in line with the FDA’s policy and others being marketed with unproven claims. “We appreciate industry’s willingness to help supply alcohol-based hand sanitizer to the market to meet the increasing demand for these products and are grateful for their efforts,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “With this increased supply comes our continued mission to ensure safety of these products. It is important that hand sanitizer be manufactured in a way that makes them unpalatable to people, especially young children, and that they are appropriately labeled to discourage accidental or intentional ingestion. Additionally, hand sanitizers are not proven to treat COVID-19, and like other products meant for external use, are not for ingestion, inhalation, or intravenous use.” Following the FDA’s guidance aimed at increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, the agency has received feedback and questions over the past few weeks from industry and congressional members, particularly regarding the need to use denatured alcohol for these products. Adding these denaturants to the alcohol renders the product more bitter and less appealing to ingest, particularly for young children. While the agency understands the economic and business reasons behind foregoing this step in the manufacturing process, such an approach undermines the agency’s mission of helping to ensure the safety of FDA-regulated products for consumer use, which is the FDA’s top priority. This approach is consistent with the FDA’s policies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic on including denatured alcohol in hand sanitizer and is even more important now as more consumers rely on its use as a mitigation tool against the deadly virus. To illustrate the importance of using denatured alcohol and, according to an FDA analysis of data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Association of Poison Control Centers surveillance team, calls to the National Poison Data System last month related to hand sanitizer increased by 79% compared to March 2019. The majority of these calls were for unintentional exposures in children 5 years of age and younger. Every year, there are hundreds of calls to poison control centers regarding exposure to hand sanitizer, many of which result in adverse events, including death. Unfortunately, ingestion of only a small amount of hand sanitizer may be potentially lethal in a young child. This month, the agency received an adverse event report of a 13-year-old child drinking hand sanitizer packaged in a liquor bottle from a distiller. The sanitizer was not denatured and was reported to taste like normal drinking alcohol. To protect consumers, especially children, it is important to make hand sanitizer unpalatable. The FDA also found that the product ingested by the 13-year-old child was not consistent with the labeling component of the agency’s temporary policy— underscoring the importance that these products include a Drug Facts Label, warnings to keep the product out of reach of children, information to get medical help or call a poison control center right away if swallowed and to supervise use in children under 6 years of age to prevent accidental swallowing. These safety measures apply regardless of where the product is intended to be used, as it can easily be distributed beyond the original intended setting. The FDA is also concerned about hand sanitizer products being sold by some manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic with unproven claims. Last week, the agency issued its first warning letter for a hand sanitizer product marketed with unproven COVID-19-related claims, in violation of federal law. The letter was issued to for selling their product with misleading claims, for example, “Prefense…protects you from germs with just one application per day! It’s like wearing an invisible glove.” The company’s webpage also states that Prefense can, “protect you from pathogens up to 24 hours or for 10 hand washes.” The FDA is not aware of any evidence that hand sanitizer products can protect consumers for 24 hours or after multiple hand-washings. These types of claims may put consumers at risk by leading to a false sense of security and resulting in infrequent hand washing or hand sanitizing. The agency urges consumers to be vigilant of products sold with misleading, unproven claims, by following our updates on our The FDA remains committed to working with manufacturers, compounders, state boards of pharmacy and the public to increase the safe supply of alcohol-based hand sanitizer available to Americans, as well as continuing to take appropriate action against manufacturers making unproven claims.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Targeted Therapy to Treat Aggressive Form of Lung Cancer", "date": "May 06, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tabrecta (capmatinib) for the treatment of adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body. Tabrecta is the first FDA-approved therapy to treat NSCLC with specific mutations (those that lead to mesenchymal-epithelial transition or MET exon 14 skipping). The FDA also approved the FoundationOne CDx assay (F1CDx) as a companion diagnostic for Tabrecta today. Most patients had tumor samples that were tested for mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping using local tests and confirmed with the F1CDx, which is a next-generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic device that is capable of detecting several mutations, including mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping. NSCLC is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. It is the most common type of lung cancer with up to 90% of all lung carcinomas falling into the non-small cell category. NSCLC occurs when healthy cells become abnormal and grow rapidly. One danger of this form of cancer is that there’s a high likelihood that the cancer cells will spread from the lungs to other organs and body parts. Cancer metastasis consists of a sequential series of events, and MET exon 14 skipping is recognized as a critical event for metastasis of carcinomas. Mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping are found in 3-4% of patients with lung cancer. Tabrecta is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it functions by blocking a key enzyme that results in helping to stop the tumor cells from growing. The FDA approved Tabrecta based on the results of a clinical trial involving patients with NSCLC with mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative status, and at least one measurable lesion. During the clinical trial, participants received Tabrecta 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of participants that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). The efficacy population included 28 patients who had never undergone treatment for NSCLC and 69 previously treated patients. The ORR for the 28 participants was 68%, with 4% having a complete response and 64% having a partial response. The ORR for the 69 participants was 41%, with all having a partial response. Of the responding participants who had never undergone treatment for NSCLC, 47% had a duration of response lasting 12 months or longer compared to 32.1% of the responding participants who had been previously treated. Common side effects for patients taking Tabrecta are peripheral edema (leg swelling), nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea (shortness of breath) and decreased appetite. Tabrecta may cause serious side effects including interstitial lung disease (a group of lung conditions that causes scarring of lung tissues) or pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung tissue). Tabrecta should be permanently discontinued in patients with these side effects. Tabrecta may also cause hepatotoxicity (damage to liver cells), and health care professionals should monitor a patient’s liver function tests prior to starting and when taking Tabrecta. If a patient experiences hepatotoxicity, Tabrecta should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued. Based on a clear positive signal for phototoxicity (drug-induced damage to cells that is enhanced by UV light) in laboratory studies in cells, patients may be more sensitive to sunlight and should be advised to take precautions to cover their skin and use sunscreen and not to tan while taking Tabrecta. Tabrecta may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Health care professionals should advise pregnant women of this risk and should advise both females of reproductive potential and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tabrecta and for one week after the last dose. Tabrecta was approved under the pathway, which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and generally provide a meaningful advantage over existing treatments.

Heart failure occurs when the heart does not pump enough blood to support the body’s needs, and this type of heart failure happens when the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, is weakened. With the approval, Farxiga is the first in this particular drug class, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, to be approved to treat adults with New York Heart Association’s functional class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Farxiga was shown in a clinical trial to improve survival and reduce the need for hospitalization in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Farxiga’s safety and effectiveness were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4,744 participants. The average age of participants was 66 years and more participants were male (77%) than female. To determine the drug’s effectiveness, investigators examined the occurrence of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a once-daily dose of either 10 milligrams of Farxiga or a placebo (inactive treatment). After about 18 months, people who received Farxiga had fewer cardiovascular deaths, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits than those receiving the placebo. Farxiga can cause dehydration, serious urinary tract infections and genital yeast infections. Elderly patients, patients with kidney problems, those with low blood pressure, and patients on diuretics should be assessed for their volume status and kidney function. Patients with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis (acid buildup in the blood) should also be assessed. Serious cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene) have been reported in people with diabetes taking Farxiga. This application received designation, meaning the agency planned to take action on the application within six months, because the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. Farxiga is also FDA-approved to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in addition to diet and exercise, and to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among adults with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease or other risk factors.

In response to scammers on the internet selling unproven medical products, the FDA has taken – and continues to take – a number of steps to find and stop those selling unapproved products that fraudulently claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. “While we seek to ensure access to critical medical products, it is imperative that we continue our efforts to find and prevent the sale and distribution of products that may be harmful to the public health. Americans can rest assured that we’re leveraging our experience investigating, examining, and reviewing medical products, both at the border and within domestic commerce, to help ensure that the critical resources reaching the frontlines in the battle against COVID-19 are appropriate,” said FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D. “We take seriously our responsibility to determine whether the medical products coming into our country are fraudulent, counterfeit or illegitimate, and take action as needed.” To date, the FDA has issued 42 to companies making bogus COVID-19 claims, including one to a seller of fraudulent chlorine dioxide products, equivalent to industrial bleach, frequently referred to as “Miracle Mineral Solution” or “MMS”, as a treatment for COVID-19. After the seller refused to take corrective action, a federal court issued a requiring the seller to immediately stop distributing its unproven and potentially dangerous product. Additionally, as part of the FDA’s Operation Quack Hack, in just a few short weeks, the agency has discovered hundreds of such products including fraudulent drugs, testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) sold online with unproven claims. We continue to work with online marketplaces, domain name registrars, payment processors and social media websites to remove from their platforms products that fraudulently claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19 and to keep those products from reappearing under different names. At this time, the FDA has sent hundreds of abuse complaints to domain name registrars and internet marketplaces, who in most instances, have voluntarily removed the identified postings. We will continue to monitor the online ecosystem for fraudulent products peddled by bad actors seeking to profit from this global pandemic. We encourage anyone aware of suspected fraudulent medical products for COVID-19 to them to the FDA. There are a number of examples of unproven products that the FDA is keeping out of the country.

There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. Today, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma entered a preliminary injunction against Xephyr LLC, doing business as N-Ergetics, and individual defendants Brad Brand, Derill J. Fussell and Linda Fussell. The injunction requires Xephyr and the associated individuals to, among other things, immediately stop distributing colloidal silver products. It was issued on the same basis as a entered by the court on May 14, 2020. As noted then, defendants offered their colloidal silver products for sale to treat coronavirus, which includes COVID-19 and many other diseases, and, which FDA alleges violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) because the products are unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs. The preliminary injunction governs throughout the course of the legal proceeding, thereby disrupting the supply chain for defendants’ fraudulent colloidal silver products until the court rules on permanent relief. The complaint was filed by the U.S. Department of Justice at FDA’s request. The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction. The FDA issued a to remind reprocessing staff in health care facilities to use the correct sterilization cycle associated with certain models of the Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) STERRAD Sterilization Systems and to only decontaminate compatible N95 or N95-equivalent respirators for reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sterilization systems help increase the availability of respirators by allowing decontaminated compatible respirators to be reused so health care workers on the front lines can be better protected when providing care to patients with COVID-19. Yesterday, the FDA issued two guidance documents (one new guidance and one revised guidance) for industry to help address potential shortages of face masks, surgical masks, respirators, and face shields for use during the COVID-19 public health emergency: . These guidances help to address potential shortages by facilitating the safe reuse and conservation of surgical masks and respirators for medical purposes through the use of decontamination and bioburden reduction systems and providing recommendations of alternatives and updated options for when FDA-cleared or NIOSH-approved N95 respirators are not available. Yesterday, the FDA issued an for emergency use of the CLEWICU System of CLEW Medical Ltd for use by healthcare providers in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a diagnostic aid to assist with the early identification of adult patients who are likely to be diagnosed with respiratory failure or hemodynamic instability which are common complications associated with COVID-19. The CLEWICU system utilizes the full range of available patient data to provide continuous predictions based on data driven algorithms and machine learning models. The CLEWICU system delivers workflow improvements and dynamic worklist prioritization, enabling healthcare providers to spend less time on administration and more time on patient treatment. In this way, CLEWICU may reduce the contact between ICU personnel and patients by providing the ICU clinician the ability to view the patient risk status from a remote location.

Today, the FDA provided an on the Agency’s efforts to combat the extremely concerning actions by companies and individuals that are exploiting or taking advantage of widespread fear among consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to scammers on the internet selling unproven medical products, the FDA has taken – and continues to take – a number of steps to find and stop those selling unapproved products that fraudulently claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. The FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to two companies for selling fraudulent COVID-19 products, as part of the agency’s effort to protect consumers. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. Yesterday, the FDA shared the first and detailed data from the independent validation study performed at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI), which data were used to support an EUA request. The results come from a collaborative effort by the FDA, NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to evaluate certain serological tests. While the EUA request was not granted solely based on the validation data, the data were leveraged to inform FDA’s decision making. The NCI FNLCR test report provides new details on the testing that is being performed by NCI. Essential samples and materials used in the evaluation were provided by the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Mount Sinai Health System, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, including members of the Departments of Microbiology and Pathology, and the Vitalant Research Institute. Yesterday, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Sherlock BioSciences, Inc.’s . This test is the first authorized use of CRISPR technology for an infectious disease test. The Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 Kit is a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) diagnostic test that looks for the specific target RNA or DNA sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in upper respiratory specimens, such as nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, such as from fluid in the lungs, from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Use of the test is limited to laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity tests. Today, the FDA reissued the EUA for . The FDA updated the eligibility criteria by making a few main changes, including revising one of the criteria that required an accredited and independent lab test to now require that certain respirators previously listed in Appendix A must pass CDC/NIOSH testing, as further explained in the EUA. As part of the government’s continuous quality assessment of these respirators, CDC, working with FDA, conducted additional assessments and found that some of the respirators authorized under the April 3, 2020 EUA did not meet the expected performance standards. As a result, the FDA revised and reissued the EUA to remove all firms that were authorized based on the independent lab test criterion. Additionally, the FDA, in collaboration with CDC NIOSH, is increasing surveillance and sampling of all respirators imported from China – all respirator shipments from China that come into the U.S. will be subject to random sampling and testing by CDC NIOSH to determine whether the respirator meets acceptable particulate filtration standard. The FDA is committed to helping health care providers navigate this dynamic situation, and we issued a with considerations for all health care facilities that have respirators in their inventory. Today, the FDA issued a . The FDA has become aware of the potential for health care facility staff that reprocess and sterilize medical devices to misinterpret the indicators used to validate the sterilization of medical devices because there is no standard indicator color to indicate a sterilized device. The Agency recommends that health care facility staff review the manufacturer’s instructions for their indicators. Each manufacturer has developed its own color scheme to validate the sterilization process, and the colors vary among manufacturers even though many are validated for the same cycle conditions. There have been no injuries reported to the FDA associated with the use of these indicators. Today, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance, “ ” to assist animal drug sponsors in submitting timely and informative drug shortage notifications to the FDA. This guidance explains how and why to notify the FDA, and the details to provide about the discontinuance or interruption of manufacturing and other factors that may impact availability of animal drug products. The guidance also includes examples of steps FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine may take to prevent or mitigate animal drug shortages, and information sponsors can provide proactively to help avoid shortages.

{"title": "FDA Alerts Patients and Health Care Professionals to Nitrosamine Impurity Findings in Certain Metformin Extended-Release Products ", "date": "May 28, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing today that agency laboratory testing has revealed levels of the nitrosamine impurity N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above the agency’s acceptable intake limit in several lots of the extended-release (ER) formulation of metformin, a prescription drug used to control high blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. The agency is in contact with five firms to recommend they voluntarily recall their products. Company recall notices will be posted on . There are additional manufacturers of the metformin ER formulation that supply a significant portion of the U.S. market, and their products are not being recalled. The FDA is continuing to work closely with manufacturers to ensure appropriate testing. Assessments are underway to determine whether metformin ER recalls will result in shortages and the agency will work closely with manufacturers to prevent or reduce any impact of shortages. “The FDA has strict standards for safety, effectiveness and quality, and the agency makes every effort based on science and data to help keep the U.S. drug supply safe. We understand that patients may have concerns about possible impurities in their medicines, and want to assure the public that we have been looking closely at this problem over many months in order to provide patients and health care professionals with clear and accurate answers,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Now that we have identified some metformin products that do not meet our standards, we’re taking action. As we have been doing since this impurity was first identified, we will communicate as new scientific information becomes available and will take further action, if appropriate.” Patients should continue taking metformin tablets even after recalls occur, until they consult with their health care professional who can prescribe a replacement. Patients with type 2 diabetes could face dangerous health risks if they stop taking their prescribed metformin. The FDA recommends that health care professionals continue to prescribe metformin when clinically appropriate; FDA testing has not shown NDMA in immediate release (IR) metformin products (the most commonly prescribed type of metformin). The agency is working with manufacturers of the recalled tablets to identify the source of the NDMA impurity. At this time, the elevated levels of NDMA have been found in some finished-dose tablets of the ER formulation but have not been detected NDMA in samples of the metformin active pharmaceutical ingredient. The agency is also asking all manufacturers of metformin containing ER products to evaluate the risk of excessive NDMA in their product and to test each batch before it is released into the U.S. market. If testing shows NDMA above the acceptable intake limit, the manufacturer should inform the agency and should not release the batch to the U.S. market. In late 2019, the FDA it had become aware of NDMA in some metformin products in other countries. The agency immediately began testing to determine whether the metformin in the U.S. supply was at risk, as part of the ongoing investigation into nitrosamine impurities across medication types. By February 2020, the agency had identified of NDMA in some samples, but at that time, no FDA-tested sample of metformin exceeded the acceptable intake limit for NDMA. The FDA has maintained that it would continue with ongoing testing of metformin and other medications, and if any levels of NDMA or other impurities were identified, swift action would be taken. Recently, the FDA became aware of reports of higher levels of NDMA in certain ER formulations of metformin via a citizen petition filed by a private laboratory. FDA laboratories tested the same metformin lots that the private laboratory found to contain NDMA above the acceptable intake limit. The agency confirmed unacceptable NDMA levels in some, but not all, of those lots. In other instances, our laboratory detected NDMA in lots that the private laboratory did not. The agency also found that the levels of NDMA, when present, were generally lower than reported by the private laboratory. Given FDA scientists’ deep experience quantifying these impurities in drugs, the agency is confident in the reliability of the FDA’s testing method and results and will continue to take action based on the latest scientific information. The results have also been consistent with the findings of other regulatory agencies’ laboratories around the world. NDMA is a common contaminant found in water and foods including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. Everyone is exposed to some level of NDMA. The FDA and the international scientific community do not expect it to cause harm when ingested at low levels. The FDA’s acceptable intake limit for NDMA in drug formulations is 96 nanograms per day. The FDA does not expect nitrosamines to cause harm when ingested at or below the acceptable intake limit levels (such low levels of nitrosamines are present in foods in low levels and ingested as part of usual diets) even over a long period of time (such as a 70-year lifespan). Nitrosamine impurities may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them at above-acceptable levels over long periods of time, but we do not anticipate that shorter-term exposure at levels above the acceptable intake limit would lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. We are working to ensure medicines on the U.S. market do not exceed the acceptable intake limit. The FDA has previously investigated the presence of nitrosamines in the U.S. drug supply. The investigation began with the blood pressure and heart failure medicines called (ARBs) and later expanded to include heartburn medicines, , as well as diabetes medication, and other medicines. In April 2020, the agency withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ranitidine drug products from the market because of test results showing that NDMA in some ranitidine products increases over time and, when stored at higher than room temperatures, may result in consumer exposure to unacceptable levels of this impurity. There are multiple reasons for the presence of NDMA in drugs. The FDA has previously found that the source of NDMA can be related to the drug’s manufacturing process or its chemical structure or even the conditions in which they are stored or packaged. As food and drugs are processed in the body, nitrosamines, including NDMA, can be formed. The FDA is taking a systematic approach to identify medicines with nitrosamines above the acceptable intake limit and remove them from the market. Improved technology enables the detection of even trace amounts of impurities in drug products and may be the reason why more products have been found to have low levels of NDMA. Today, better testing methods exist, and the FDA better understands the specific manufacturing steps that may increase the risk of nitrosamine formation. The FDA works closely with international drug regulatory agencies, who have also been testing drug products for NDMA and are collaborating to investigate the sources of these impurities. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "FDA Approves First Drug to Image Tau Pathology in Patients Being Evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease", "date": "May 28, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tauvid (flortaucipir F18) for intravenous injection, the first drug used to help image a distinctive characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease in the brain called tau pathology. Tauvid is a radioactive diagnostic agent for adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease. Tauvid is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a primary marker of Alzheimer’s disease. Two proteins – tau and amyloid – are recognized as hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, pathological forms of tau proteins develop inside neurons in the brain, creating neurofibrillary tangles. After Tauvid is administered intravenously, it binds to sites in the brain associated with this tau protein misfolding. The brain can then be imaged with a PET scan to help identify the presence of tau pathology. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease that typically begins with mild memory loss. It is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, there were as many as 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease. This number is projected to nearly triple to 14 million by 2060. Currently, Alzheimer’s disease can only be definitively diagnosed by pathologic evaluation of a patient’s brain once they have died (post-mortem). There are three imaging agents approved for post-mortem amyloid pathology with PET scans. The safety and effectiveness of Tauvid imaging was evaluated in two clinical studies. In each study, five evaluators read and interpreted the Tauvid imaging. The evaluators were blinded to clinical information and interpreted the imaging as positive or negative. The first study enrolled 156 patients who were terminally ill and agreed to undergo Tauvid imaging and participate in a post-mortem brain donation program. In 64 of the patients who died within nine months of the Tauvid brain scan, evaluators’ reading of the Tauvid scan was compared to post-mortem readings from independent pathologists who evaluated the density and distribution of NFTs in the same brain. The study showed evaluators reading the Tauvid images had a high probability of correctly evaluating patients with tau pathology and had an average-to-high probability of correctly evaluating patients without tau pathology. The second study included the same patients with terminal illness as the first study, plus 18 additional patients with terminal illness, and 159 patients with cognitive impairment being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (the indicated patient population). The study gauged how well Tauvid evaluators’ readings agreed with each other’s assessments of the readings. Perfect reader agreement would be 1, while no reader agreement would be 0. In this study, reader agreement was 0.87 across all 241 patients. In a separate subgroup analysis that included the 82 terminally ill patients diagnosed after death and the 159 patients with cognitive impairment, reader agreement was 0.90 for the patients in the indicated population and 0.82 in the terminally ill patients. Tauvid’s ability to detect tau pathology was assessed in patients with generally severe stages of dementia and may be lower in patients in earlier stages of cognitive decline than in the patients with terminal illness who were studied. The most common adverse reactions in patients using Tauvid were headache, injection site pain and increased blood pressure. Tauvid is not indicated for use in the evaluation of patients for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The FDA granted the manufacturer of Tauvid , under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. The FDA granted approval of Tauvid to Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc.

This product uses vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP) to decontaminate compatible N95 respirators that are, or potentially are, contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogenic microorganisms for multiple-user reuse by healthcare personnel to prevent exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates when there are insufficient supplies of face-filtering respirators (FFRs) resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. N95 respirators containing cellulose-based materials are incompatible with the SSS VHP N95 RDS. This system is operated by employees of Stryker Sustainability Solutions, whose facilities are designed to allow adequate space for receiving respirators for decontamination, visually inspecting respirators for gross contamination or damage, exposing respirators to VHP, and packaging or labeling them for return to the sender so as to minimize contamination and ensure orderly handling procedures. With respirators limited to a maximum of three decontaminations, each is permanently marked to indicate the number of decontamination cycles it has undergone. Yesterday, the FDA further supported its effort to evaluate diagnostic tests of COVID-19 by providing a SARS-CoV-2 reference panel. This panel is an independent performance validation step for diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection that are being used for clinical, not research, purposes. The FDA panel is available to commercial and laboratory developers who are interacting with the FDA through the pre-emergency use authorization (EUA) process or whose tests have been issued an EUA. The FDA will provide the reference panel to developers at the appropriate stage in the process. There is no need for these test developers to take additional action in order to receive the reference panel.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Option to Treat Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Fibroids in Women", "date": "May 29, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted approval to Oriahnn (an estrogen and progestin combination product consisting of elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate) capsules, co-packaged for oral use, for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women. Fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) muscle tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bowel or bladder problems and infertility. Some women may not experience any symptoms, but many do, including heavy bleeding with periods. Fibroids can occur at any age but are most common in women 35 to 49 years of age. They typically resolve after menopause but are a leading reason for hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) in the United States when they cause severe symptoms. The efficacy of Oriahnn was established in two clinical trials in which a total of 591 premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding received the drug or placebo for six months. Heavy menstrual bleeding at baseline was defined as having at least two menstrual cycles with greater than 80 mL (about a third of a cup) of menstrual blood loss (MBL). The primary endpoint was the proportion of women who achieved MBL volume less than 80 mL at the final month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from the start of the study (baseline) to the final month. In the first study, 68.5% of patients who received Oriahnn achieved this endpoint (compared to 8.7% of patients who received placebo). In the second study, 76.5% of patients who received Oriahnn achieved this endpoint (compared to 10.5% of patients who received placebo). Oriahnn may cause bone loss over time, and the loss in some women may not be completely recovered after stopping treatment. Because bone loss may increase the risk for fractures, women should not take Oriahnn for more than 24 months. Health care professionals may recommend a bone density scan (called DXA scan) when starting women on Oriahnn and periodically while on treatment. The most common side effects of Oriahnn were hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth), headache, fatigue and irregular vaginal bleeding. The drug label for Oriahnn includes a Boxed Warning about the risk of vascular events (strokes) and thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders (blood clots), especially in women at increased risk for these events. Patients should stop Oriahnn if a blood clot, heart attack or stroke occurs. Oriahnn is contraindicated (not to be used under any circumstance) in women with a history of or current blood clots and in women at increased risk for blood clots, including women over 35 years of age who smoke or women with uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). Other contraindications include known osteoporosis, a history of or current breast cancer or other hormonally-sensitive cancer, liver disease or undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding. Oriahnn does not prevent pregnancy. Women should use non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for one week after discontinuing the medication. Oriahnn may delay the detection of a pregnancy because it changes menstrual bleeding patterns. Oriahnn may increase blood pressure, which should be monitored in women with controlled hypertension during treatment with Oriahnn. Patients should be advised on signs and symptoms of liver injury. Patients are advised to seek medical attention if they experience suicidal ideation or behavior, new onset or worsening depression, anxiety or other mood changes. Patients taking Oriahnn may experience hair loss (alopecia). There is a risk of allergic reaction with Oriahnn because its inactive ingredient, FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in some women. Oriahnn must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. The approval of Oriahnn was granted to AbbVie Inc.

Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective, especially during this ongoing pandemic,” said Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services and Chief Counsel of FDA Stacy Amin. “The FDA will continue our efforts to make sure that this and other like-minded sellers comply with the law.” The FDA, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), previously issued a to Xephyr about its colloidal silver products. The FDA and FTC requested that the company respond within 48 hours describing the specific steps it has taken to correct the violations. While the sellers removed their COVID -19-related webpages for a time, by the end of April 2020, they had resumed marketing their colloidal silver products as a treatment for COVID-19 in violation of the law. On their website, , Xephyr markets their colloidal silver products to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), among other diseases. Labeling accompanying the purchased product also includes claims that colloidal silver can cure, mitigate, treat or prevent cholera, diabetes, cancer and AIDS. There is a lack of adequate data to establish the safety and effectiveness of Xephyr’s colloidal silver products for use in the treatment or prevention of any disease, and the FDA has not approved the defendants’ colloidal silver products for any use. As a result of these violations, today, U.S. District Judge Ronald A. White for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, entered the temporary restraining order against Xephyr and the individual defendants Brad Brand, Derill J. Fussell and Linda Fussell. The Order expires on June 4, 2020. There will be a hearing on the government’s request to extend the injunction on May 21, 2020. The complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), against the Atoka, Okla. seller and the seller’s most responsible individuals, seeks to restrain and enjoin all defendants from labeling, holding and distributing unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, in interstate commerce on a permanent basis. The FDA requested that DOJ to bring this case on behalf of the U.S. Government. The claims made in the complaint are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove to receive a permanent injunction against Xephyr. The FDA is particularly concerned that products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent serious diseases like COVID-19 may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. The only drugs authorized for emergency use do not contain colloidal silver. The FDA reminds the public to seek medical help from their health care providers and urges people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options, as well as follow advice from other federal agencies about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the FDA advises all consumers to consult with a health care professional before deciding to take any medication, and consumers should carefully read the labels of any product they are thinking of using. The FDA encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of COVID-19 products to the The FDA continues to monitor social media, online marketplaces and incoming complaints to help ensure that sellers do not continue to sell fraudulent products related to COVID-19.

Specifically, the test may return false negative results. “We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue. We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test. This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes. Negative results may need to be confirmed with a high-sensitivity authorized molecular test,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA is sharing early information available about potential inaccurate results in the spirit of transparency. The agency has been working with Abbott to analyze the information gathered to date and has worked with the company on a customer notification letter to alert users that any negative test results that are not consistent with a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms or necessary for patient management should be confirmed with another test. The FDA looks at a variety of sources to identify and understand potential patterns or significant issues with the use of the Abbott test. No diagnostic test will be 100% accurate due to performance characteristics, specimen handling, or user error, which is why it is important to study patterns and identify the cause of suspected false results so any significant issues can be addressed quickly. The agency is aware of some scientific studies that have identified accuracy issues with Abbott ID NOW and is investigating whether it could be due to the types of swabs used or the type of viral transport media (material used to transport the patient’s specimen). While there is important information to gather from these studies, it should be noted these studies have limitations, including small sample size, potential design biases, or tests that may not have been executed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use, an important part of scientific research. This is why external scientific studies are one part of the FDA’s overall evaluation of a diagnostic performance. The FDA has received 15 adverse event reports about the Abbott ID NOW device that suggest some users are receiving inaccurate negative results. The agency is reviewing these reports. It’s important to note that the adverse event reports the FDA receives from manufacturers, health care providers, health care facilities, and patients can be incomplete, inaccurate, or unverified, so agency staff must meticulously comb through the reports to identify crucial data to support any signals or patterns about device use. Moving forward, Abbott has agreed to conduct post-market studies for the ID NOW device that each will include at least 150 COVID-19 positive patients in a variety of clinical settings. The FDA will continue to review interim data on an ongoing basis. The information gathered from the post-market studies can further help the agency understand the cause or patterns of any accuracy issues and inform any additional actions the company or the FDA should take. The FDA will keep working with Abbott to further evaluate these accuracy issues and will publicly communicate any updates. Consumers or healthcare providers can reach Abbott directly at (224) 667-6100 or by The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Therapy for Patients with Lung and Thyroid Cancers with a Certain Genetic Mutation or Fusion", "date": "May 08, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Retevmo (selpercatinib) capsules to treat three types of tumors – non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancers – in patients whose tumors have an alteration (mutation or fusion) in a specific gene (RET or “rearranged during transfection”). Retevmo is the first therapy approved specifically for cancer patients with the RET gene alterations. Specifically, the cancers that Retevmo is approved to treat include: Retevmo is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it blocks a type of enzyme (kinase) and helps prevent the cancer cells from growing. Before beginning treatment, the identification of a RET gene alteration must be determined using laboratory testing. The FDA approved Retevmo on the results of a clinical trial involving patients with each of the three types of tumors. During the clinical trial, patients received 160 mg Retevmo orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of patients that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage, and duration of response (DOR). Efficacy for NSCLC was evaluated in 105 adult patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy. The ORR for the 105 patients was 64%. For 81% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. Efficacy was also evaluated in 39 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who had never undergone treatment. The ORR for these patients was 84%. For 58% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. Efficacy for MTC in adults and pediatric patients was evaluated in those 12 years of age and older with RET-mutant MTC. The study enrolled 143 patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had been previously treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib or both (types of chemotherapy), and patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had not received prior treatment with cabozantinib or vandetanib. The ORR for the 55 previously treated patients was 69%. For 76% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. Efficacy was also evaluated in 88 patients who had not been previously treated with an approved therapy for MTC. The ORR for these patients was 73%. For 61% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. Efficacy for RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer was evaluated in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. The study enrolled 19 patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who were radioactive iodine-refractory (RAI, if an appropriate treatment option) and had received another prior systemic treatment, and eight patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who were RAI-refractory and had not received any additional therapy. The ORR for the 19 previously treated patients was 79%. For 87% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. Efficacy was also evaluated in eight patients who had not received therapy other than RAI. The ORR for these patients was 100%. For 75% of patients who had a response to the treatment, their response lasted at least six months. The most common side effects with Retevmo were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes in the liver, increased blood sugar, decreased white blood cell count, decreased albumin in the blood, decreased calcium in the blood, dry mouth, diarrhea, increased creatinine (which can measure kidney function), increased alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme found in the liver and bones), hypertension, fatigue, swelling in the body or limbs, low blood platelet count, increased cholesterol, rash, constipation and decreased sodium in the blood. Retevmo can cause serious side effects including hepatotoxicity (liver damage or injury), elevated blood pressure, QT prolongation (the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats), bleeding and allergic reactions. If a patient experiences hepatotoxicity, Retevmo should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued. Patients undergoing surgery should tell their doctor as drugs similar to Retevmo have caused problems with wound healing. Retevmo may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Health care professionals should advise pregnant women of this risk and should advise both females of reproductive potential and males patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Retevmo and for one week after the last dose. Additionally, women should not breastfeed while on Retevmo. Retevmo was approved under the pathway, which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and generally provide a meaningful advantage over existing treatments. The FDA also granted this application designation, which expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Additionally, Retevmo received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Retevmo to Loxo Oncology, Inc., a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.

These diagnostic tests quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. The EUA was issued late Friday to Quidel Corporation for the . This test is authorized for use in high and moderate complexity laboratories certified by , as well as for point-of-care testing by facilities operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. Diagnostic testing is one of the pillars of our nation’s response to COVID-19 and the FDA continues to take actions to help make these critical products available, including by issuing EUAs. During this pandemic, there have been two types of tests for which the FDA has issued EUAs. One type are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, a molecular diagnostic testing technique that detects the genetic material from the virus and can help diagnose an active COVID-19 infection. The other type are serological tests that look for antibodies to the virus, which can help identify individuals who have developed an adaptive immune response to the virus, as part of either an active infection or a prior infection (serological, or should not be used to diagnose active infection). This latest FDA authorization is for an antigen test, which is a new type of diagnostic test designed for rapid detection of the virus that causes COVID-19. Each category of diagnostic test has its own unique role in the fight against this virus. PCR tests can be incredibly accurate, but running the tests and analyzing the results can take time. One of the main advantages of an antigen test is the speed of the test, which can provide results in minutes. However, antigen tests may not detect all active infections, as they do not work the same way as a PCR test. Antigen tests are very specific for the virus, but are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests. This means that positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection. With this in mind, negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with a PCR test prior to making treatment decisions or to prevent the possible spread of the virus due to a false negative. Antigen tests are also important in the overall response against COVID-19 as they can generally be produced at a lower cost than PCR tests and once multiple manufacturers enter the market, can potentially scale to test millions of Americans per day due to their simpler design, helping our country better identify infection rates closer to real time. This is just the first antigen test to be authorized and we expect more to follow. We also anticipate providing an EUA template for antigen tests, similar to ones we’ve , to help manufacturers streamline submissions and help expedite our review and issuance of additional EUAs. Antigen tests will play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19 and we will continue to offer support and expertise to help with the development of accurate tests, and to review and monitor marketed tests to ensure accuracy, while balancing the urgent need for these critical diagnostics.

For example, the FDA has learned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that authorized respirators manufactured in China may vary in their design and performance. As such, the FDA has determined that the available information does not support the decontamination of these respirators and has accordingly revised the relevant EUAs.

As part of those efforts, we are announcing that we have revised and reissued a number of EUAs to amend which respirators are authorized to be decontaminated.” Among other things, the FDA has reissued the EUAs for: According to CDC’s recommendations, decontaminated respirators should only be used when new FDA-cleared N95 respirators, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, or other FDA authorized respirators are not available. The decontamination systems are only authorized to decontaminate non-cellulose compatible N95 respirators. As such, health care personnel should not reuse a respirator that is incompatible with an authorized decontamination system but has nonetheless been decontaminated. Users of any respirator (whether or not decontaminated) should always assess for proper fit after placement. Respirators with poor fit, visible soiling, or damage should not be used. The FDA continues to be vigilant and take prompt action on imported, non-NIOSH-approved respirators to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection. For instance, the FDA is also reissuing the two EUAs covering imported respirators by tightening criteria in the as well as in the to not only include new language related to decontamination as noted above, but also to revise the Scope of Authorization with respect to which jurisdictions are included in the criteria for eligibility in both EUAs, among other revisions.

{"title": "FDA Approves New Therapy for Rare Disease Affecting Optic Nerve, Spinal Cord", "date": "June 11, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Uplizna (inebilizumab-cdon) injection for intravenous use for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients with a particular antibody (patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 or AQP4 antibody positive). NMOSD is a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Uplizna is only the second approved treatment for the disorder. In patients with NMOSD, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and proteins in the body, most often those in the optic nerves and spinal cord. Individuals with NMOSD typically have attacks of optic neuritis, which causes eye pain and vision loss. Individuals also can have attacks resulting in transverse myelitis, which often causes numbness, weakness, or paralysis of the arms and legs, along with loss of bladder and bowel control. Most attacks occur in clusters, days to months to years apart, followed by partial recovery during periods of remission. Approximately 50% of patients with NMOSD have permanent visual impairment and paralysis caused by NMOSD attacks. According to the National Institutes of Health, women are more often affected by NMOSD than men and African Americans are at greater risk of the disease than are Caucasians. Estimates vary, but NMOSD is thought to impact approximately 4,000 to 8,000 patients in the United States. NMOSD can be associated with antibodies that bind to a protein called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Binding of the anti-AQP4 antibody appears to activate other components of the immune system, causing inflammation and damage to the central nervous system. The effectiveness of Uplizna for the treatment of NMOSD was demonstrated in a clinical study of 230 adult patients that evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous Uplizna. In the trial, 213 of the 230 patients had antibodies against AQP4 (anti-AQP4 antibody positive). During the 197-day study, the risk of an NMOSD relapse in the 161 anti-AQP4 antibody positive patients who were treated with Uplizna was reduced by 77% when compared to the placebo treatment group. There was no evidence of a benefit in patients who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative. The prescribing information for Uplizna includes a warning for infusion reactions, potential depletion of certain proteins (hypogammaglobulinemia), and potential increased risk of infection – including Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, and potential reactivation of hepatitis B and tuberculosis. The most common adverse reactions in the NMOSD clinical trial were urinary tract infection, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), nausea and back pain. Women who are pregnant should not take Uplizna because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The FDA advises health care professionals to inform females of reproductive age to use effective contraception during treatment with Uplizna and for six months after the last dose. Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and should be administered at least four weeks prior to initiation of Uplizna. Uplinza received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Uplizna to Viela Bio.

The prescription-only game-based device, called EndeavorRx, is indicated for pediatric patients ages 8 to12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD who have demonstrated an attention issue. EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing and is the first digital therapeutic intended to improve symptoms associated with ADHD, as well as the first game-based therapeutic granted marketing authorization by the FDA for any type of condition. The device is intended for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder. “The EndeavorRx device offers a non-drug option for improving symptoms associated with ADHD in children and is an important example of the growing field of digital therapy and digital therapeutics,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA is committed to providing regulatory pathways that enable patients timely access to safe and effective innovative digital therapeutics.” ADHD is a common disorder that begins in childhood, affecting approximately . Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and very high levels of activity. According to the , diagnosis of ADHD should be conducted by a trained health care professional and follow an evaluation of symptoms or pattern of symptoms, such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. The FDA reviewed data from multiple studies in more than 600 children, including studies that evaluated, among other things, whether participants demonstrated improvements in attention function, as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), academic performance measures, and other assessment tools. There were no serious adverse events reported. The most common adverse events observed with EndeavorRx are: frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, and aggression. The FDA reviewed the EndeavorRx through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) premarket notification process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.

The agency determined that the legal criteria for issuing an EUA are no longer met. Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use. This is the statutory standard for issuance of an EUA. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services originally requested the EUA covering chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the FDA granted the EUA on March 28, 2020 based on the science and data available at the time. Today, in consultation with the FDA, BARDA sent a letter to the FDA requesting revocation of the EUA based on up to date science and data. “We’ve made clear throughout the public health emergency that our actions will be guided by science and that our decisions may evolve as we learn more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, review the latest data, and consider the balance of risks versus benefits of treatments for COVID-19,” said FDA Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs Anand Shah, M.D. “The FDA always underpins its decision-making with the most trustworthy, high-quality, up-to-date evidence available. We will continue to examine all of the emergency use authorizations the FDA has issued and make changes, as appropriate, based on emerging evidence.” The FDA has a responsibility to regularly review the appropriateness of an EUA, and as such, the agency will review emerging information associated with the emergency uses for the authorized products. Recent results from a large randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients, a population similar to the population for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were authorized for emergency use, demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine showed no benefit on mortality or in speeding recovery. This outcome was consistent with other new data, including data showing that the suggested dosing regimens for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to kill or inhibit the virus that causes COVID-19. The totality of scientific evidence currently available indicate a lack of benefit. “While additional clinical trials continue to evaluate the potential benefit of these drugs in treating or preventing COVID-19, we determined the emergency use authorization was no longer appropriate.

Through a new website, Project Patient Voice creates a consistent source of publicly available information describing patient-reported symptoms from cancer trials for marketed treatments. While this patient-reported data has historically been analyzed by the FDA during the drug approval process, it is rarely included in product labeling and, therefore, is largely inaccessible to the public. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data is collected using questionnaires that patients complete during clinical trials. These questionnaires are designed to capture important information about disease- or treatment-related symptoms. This includes how severe or how often a symptom or side effect occurs. Patient-reported data can provide additional, complementary information for health care professionals to discuss with patients, specifically when discussing the potential side effects of a particular cancer treatment. In contrast to the clinician-reported safety data in product labeling, the data in Project Patient Voice is obtained directly from patients and can show symptoms before treatment starts and at multiple time points while receiving cancer treatment. will include a list of cancer clinical trials that have available patient-reported symptom data.

The visualizations and data included on the website are voluntarily provided by the drug companies that conducted the clinical trials. AstraZeneca is the first company to provide patient-reported outcome data for one of their FDA-approved drugs and has collaborated with the FDA to identify methods to display the information in a way that is informative to health care professionals and patients. Project Patient Voice is not meant to replace the clinician-reported safety information that is available as part of a drug’s labeling. Data from Project Patient Voice should not substitute for advice from a health care professional. Rather, Project Patient Voice serves as a complement to FDA patient labeling and patient information, not a sole source of information on which to make decisions about medical care. The FDA will seek public feedback regarding the Project Patient Voice pilot effort at a virtual co-sponsored with the American Society of Clinical Oncology on July 17. The “Clinical Outcome Assessments in Cancer Clinical Trials” workshop will include health care providers, patients, health outcomes researchers, industry, advocacy groups and other stakeholders interested in rigorous measurement of symptom and functional outcomes. In addition to discussing trial design considerations to obtain patient-reported symptomatic side effects, the FDA will obtain feedback on the presentation of PRO symptomatic side effect data on the Project Patient Voice website to further ensure that the information is clear and meaningful to health care professionals and patients.

Hahn, M.D., issued the following statement regarding food export restrictions pertaining to COVID-19: “The United States understands the concerns of consumers here domestically and around the world who want to know that producers, processors and regulators are taking every necessary precaution to prioritize food safety especially during these challenging times. However, efforts by some countries to restrict global food exports related to COVID-19 transmission are not consistent with the known science of transmission.” “There is no evidence that people can contract COVID-19 from food or from food packaging. The U.S. food safety system, overseen by our agencies, is the global leader in ensuring the safety of our food products, including product for export.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in conjunction with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), has issued guidance for manufacturing facilities, including food facilities, specific to controlling the spread of COVID-19 between workers.

Today, the FDA issued a new resource explaining the different categories of tests in the fight against COVID-19: diagnostic tests and antibody tests. As the video explains, diagnostic tests can tell if the tested person currently is infected. Antibody or serology tests detect if the person’s blood contains antibodies to coronavirus. The body produces antibodies when one becomes infected by the virus, and they help the immune system fight off the infection. If an antibody test finds antibodies in the blood, it likely means the person has been previously infected with the virus. Antibody tests do not detect whether a person is currently infected and should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection. The results from antibody tests can help us better understand questions about exposure to COVID-19. On June 3, 2020, the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug application for (ANDA 209307), indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive-care setting and sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures. The most common side effects of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection are hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. This drug is listed in the FDA Drug Shortage Database.

{"title": "FDA Warns Four Manufacturers of Unapproved Injectable Drugs Labeled as Homeopathic", "date": "June 16, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to four companies for selling unapproved injectable drug products labeled as that can pose serious risks to patient health and violate federal law, as part of the agency’s efforts to protect Americans from potentially harmful products that are labeled as homeopathic. The FDA is particularly concerned about unapproved injectable drug products labeled as homeopathic because they are injected directly into the body, often directly into the bloodstream and bypass some of the body's key natural defenses against toxins, toxic ingredients and dangerous organisms that can cause serious and life-threatening harm. Additionally, unapproved drugs that claim to cure, treat or prevent serious conditions may cause consumers to delay or stop medical treatments that have been found safe and effective through the FDA review process. “The FDA’s drug approval requirements are designed to protect patients by ensuring, among other things, that drugs are safe and effective for their intended uses. These unapproved injectable drugs are particularly concerning because they inherently present greater risks to patients because of how they are administered,” said Donald D. Ashley, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “These products are further concerning given that they are labeled to contain potentially toxic ingredients intended for injection directly into the body. These warning letters reflect our continued commitment to patient safety.” No currently marketed drug products labeled as homeopathic have been approved by the FDA for any use and the agency cannot assure these drugs meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Products labeled as homeopathic can be made from a wide range of substances, including ingredients derived from plants, healthy or diseased animal or human sources, minerals and chemicals, and they can include known poisons or toxins. These drugs are often marketed as natural, safe and effective alternatives to approved prescription and nonprescription products and are widely available in the marketplace. Additionally, the lack of premarket quality review is particularly concerning for injectable drugs, which generally pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body’s natural defenses. The FDA issued the warning letters to The products included in the warning letters are new drugs because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their labeled uses, and FDA has not approved these products. Some drugs, such as “Enercel,” marketed by World Health Advanced Technologies, Ltd., are intended for serious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C. Many of the drugs were labeled to contain potentially toxic ingredients such as nux vomica, belladonna (deadly nightshade), mercurius solubilis (mercury), and plumbum aceticum (lead). For example, nux vomica contains strychnine, which is a highly toxic, well-studied poison that is used to kill rodents. The agency is concerned that these potentially toxic ingredients present additional risks of serious harm when delivered directly into the body, including directly into the bloodstream. Drugs labeled as homeopathic may also cause significant and even irreparable harm if they are poorly manufactured. Viatrexx was also cited for substandard manufacturing practices for sterile drugs. The foreign manufacturers of the injectable drugs sold by Hervert Pharmaceuticals, LLC; MediNatura New Mexico, Inc.; and Viatrexx were also placed on to stop these drugs from entering the U.S. The FDA has taken steps to clarify for both consumers and industry how the potential safety risks of these products are assessed. On Oct. 24, 2019, the FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400 “Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed,” because it was inconsistent with the agency’s risk-based approach to regulatory and enforcement actions. The FDA also issued a revision of its draft guidance, titled , for public comment. When finalized, this guidance will explain the categories of homeopathic drug products that we intend to prioritize under our risk-based enforcement approach. In the interim, before the draft guidance is finalized, the FDA intends to apply its general approach to prioritizing risk-based regulatory and enforcement action.

{"title": "FDA Approves Drug to Treat Infants and Children with HIV", "date": "June 12, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tivicay (dolutegravir) tablets and Tivicay PD (dolutegravir) tablets for suspension to treat HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg (6.61 pounds) in combination with other antiretroviral treatments. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at the end of 2016, there were living with HIV in the U.S. and dependent areas, with 99 new HIV-1 infections diagnosed in this age group in 2017. Effective treatment is important in reducing the amount of virus in the blood. Tivicay and Tivicay PD are intended to treat pediatric patients at least 4 weeks old and 3 kg who have never been treated for HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) class drug. The safety and effectiveness of Tivicay and Tivicay PD were supported by a trial that included 75 HIV-1–infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to less than 18 years old. The average age was 27 months old. This trial, where both the researchers and subjects knew which treatment was being administered, along with another trial, showed that the safety, effectiveness and pharmacokinetics of Tivicay and Tivicay PD in pediatric patients was comparable to adults taking dolutegravir. At 24 weeks, 62% of pediatric patients taking Tivicay or Tivicay PD had an undetectable viral load (the presence of virus in the blood) and at 48 weeks, 69% had an undetectable viral load. Also, on average, study subjects had higher levels of certain cells (CD4 cells) that help the body fight off infection. The most common adverse reactions observed in adult patients treated with Tivicay are insomnia, fatigue and headache. Patients with a hypersensitivity to dolutegravir should not take Tivicay or Tivicay PD. Tivicay and Tivicay PD should not be administered with dofetilide. Some patients reported hypersensitivity reactions such as rash and organ dysfunction. Patients should discontinue Tivicay or Tivicay PD if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. Patients taking dolutegravir regimens have reported liver toxicity. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or elevated liver enzyme levels and should be monitored. Patients in the first trimester of pregnancy should consider an alternative treatment to dolutegravir due to the risk of neural tube defects and should be counseled about using effective contraception. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the immune system begins to recover but then responds to a previously acquired infection with an inflammatory response that unexpectedly makes symptoms of the infection worse, has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Tivicay and Tivicay PD.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Treatment for Adult Onset Still’s Disease, a Severe and Rare Disease", "date": "June 16, 2020", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ilaris (canakinumab) injection for the treatment of Active Still’s disease, including Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD). Ilaris was previously approved for Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older. AOSD is a rare and serious autoinflammatory disease of unknown origin. Autoinflammatory diseases are caused by abnormalities of the immune system, which trigger an inflammatory response that can damage the body's own tissues. Characteristics of AOSD have considerable overlap with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA), which includes fever, arthritis, rash and elevated markers for inflammation. The overlapping features of AOSD and SJIA suggest this is a disease continuum rather than two separate diseases. The role of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a type of cytokine important in regulating the body’s immune system, is well-established in AOSD and SJIA. Ilaris works by blocking the effects of IL-1 and suppressing inflammation in patients with this autoinflammatory disorder. The safety and efficacy of Ilaris for the treatment of patients with AOSD was established using comparable pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of established efficacy of canakinumab in patients with SJIA, as well as the safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and other diseases. Common side effects reported by patients treated with Ilaris are infections (colds and upper respiratory tract infections), abdominal pain and injection-site reactions. The prescribing information for Ilaris includes a warning for potential increased risk of serious infections due to IL-1 blockade. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with rheumatic conditions, in particular Still’s disease, and should be aggressively treated. Treatment with immunosuppressants may increase the risk of malignancies. Patients are advised not to receive live vaccinations during treatment.

(Chembio) DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System, a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, due to performance concerns with the accuracy of the test. Antibody tests, a type of serological test, can help provide information on a person’s and population’s exposure to COVID-19. The Chembio antibody test was one of the first antibody tests authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 public health emergency. At the time of authorization, based on the information that Chembio submitted to the FDA at that time, the agency concluded that the test met the statute’s “may be effective” standard for emergency use authorization, and that the test’s known and potential benefits outweighed its known and potential risks. As the FDA has learned more regarding the capability for performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests during the pandemic, and what performance is necessary for users to make well-informed decisions—through both the continued review and authorization of serology tests as well as through a research partnership with the National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute (NCI)— the FDA was able to develop general performance expectations for these tests, which are listed in our serology templates. Data submitted by Chembio as well as an independent evaluation of the Chembio test at NCI showed that this test generates a higher than expected rate of false results and higher than that reflected in the authorized labeling for the device. Under the current circumstances of the public health emergency, it is not reasonable to believe that the test may be effective in detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 or that the known and potential benefits of the test outweigh the known and potential risks of the test, including the high rate of false results. Moreover, the risk to public health from the false test results makes EUA revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. As such, the FDA decided to revoke the emergency use authorization of the Chembio test, and this test may not be distributed.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Facilitating Diagnostic Test Availability for Asymptomatic Testing and Sample Pooling", "date": "June 16, 2020", "contents": " Diagnostic tests are an important tool in anticipating and meeting the continuing and evolving public health needs as we combat COVID-19. Today, the FDA took a meaningful step forward in getting more tests to more Americans more quickly and making that process even easier for developers by posting regarding the validation of molecular diagnostic tests for developers that intend their assay to be used for pooling patient samples or for screening asymptomatic individuals not suspected of having COVID-19. The FDA has authorized molecular diagnostic tests for individuals suspected of having COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Such individuals can be symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic. It has always been a health care provider’s discretion to test asymptomatic individuals when warranted. Using COVID-19 diagnostic tests in this way is not the same as using such tests as a broad screening tool. Today, the FDA outlined the steps for a test to be authorized for broad screening of asymptomatic individuals by publicly providing information in updated templates for test developers on the FDA’s expectations for how a test can be validated for screening of asymptomatic individuals. This will make it easier for developers to get their tests authorized for this use. The FDA recognizes that organizations may want to conduct screening of asymptomatic individuals as part of a broader strategy to help ensure the safety of their employees, patients, students and others. In addition to these template updates, the FDA has made available with information regarding tests for screening asymptomatic individuals. In order to preserve testing resources, many developers are interested in performing their testing using a technique of “pooling” samples. This technique allows a lab to mix several samples together in a “batch” or pooled sample and then test the pooled sample with a diagnostic test. For example, four samples may be tested together, using only the resources needed for a single test. If the pooled sample is negative, it can be deduced that all patients were negative. If the pooled sample comes back positive, then each sample needs to be tested individually to find out which was positive. Because samples are pooled together, ultimately fewer tests are run overall, meaning fewer testing supplies are used, and results can be returned to patients more quickly in most cases. However, because samples are diluted, which could result in less viral genetic material available to detect, there is a greater likelihood of false negative results, particularly if not properly validated. This method works well when there is a low prevalence of cases, meaning more negative results are expected. Given that testing asymptomatic individuals means testing a greater volume of patients, and a low prevalence may be more likely in an asymptomatic population, particularly if the population is at low risk for contracting COVID-19, developers may be interested in using pooling techniques in tests used for asymptomatic screening. The FDA has always been open to working with diagnostic developers on novel testing ideas, like asymptomatic screening and specimen pooling, and has encouraged all test developers to reach out to discuss appropriate validation approaches. Today, the FDA is taking another step forward by updating templates for test developers that outline the validation expectations for these testing options to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The steps taken today by the FDA further demonstrate how we are proactively working with diagnostic test developers to facilitate new approaches and get more tests to more Americans more quickly.

{"title": "FDA Approves Targeted Treatment for Rare Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Mutation ", "date": "August 12, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Viltepso (viltolarsen) injection for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. This is the second FDA-approved targeted treatment for patients with this type of mutation. Approximately 8% of patients with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of . DMD is caused by mutations in the gene that results in an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The first symptoms are usually seen between three and five years of age and worsen over time. DMD occurs in approximately one out of every 3,600 male infants worldwide; in rare cases, it can affect females. Viltepso was evaluated in two clinical studies with a total of 32 patients, all of whom were male and had genetically confirmed DMD. The increase in dystrophin production was established in one of those two studies, a study that included 16 DMD patients, with 8 patients receiving Viltepso at the recommended dose. In the study, dystrophin levels increased, on average, from 0.6% of normal at baseline to 5.9% of normal at week 25. The FDA concluded that the applicant’s data demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. A clinical benefit of the drug has not been established. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease, and the lack of available therapies. As part of the process, the FDA is requiring the company to conduct a clinical trial to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The ongoing study is designed to assess whether Viltepso improves the time to stand for DMD patients with this confirmed mutation. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA may initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. The most common side effects observed in DMD patients (pooled from the two studies) treated with 80 mg/kg once a week were: Upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, cough and fever. Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the Viltepso clinical studies, the clinical experience with Viltepso is limited, and kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking Viltepso. Viltepso was approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway, which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and generally offer a meaningful advantage over existing treatments.

{"title": "FDA and CDC Use Technological Advancements to Investigate Multistate Outbreak of Cyclospora Illnesses Linked to Bagged Salads", "date": "August 14, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is providing an on the status of the investigation of Cyclospora cayetanensis illnesses tied to the consumption of bagged salads. This update is not just on the number of cases, but also on the scientific progress we’ve made in using a new method developed and validated by the FDA to sample for in agricultural water for the first time in a field investigation. This method was used in our current investigation and may be instrumental in our efforts to better understand the dispersion of the parasite in the environment, which could help prevent future outbreaks. The collective work by public health officials to get these new findings demonstrates a commitment to innovation and science in the service of public health and the importance of strong federal and state coordination on food safety work. Even as our agencies continue to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, teams of experts from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have continued to respond to a threat of a different kind – a nationwide outbreak of Cyclospora illnesses. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a parasite that is so small it can only be seen with a microscope. It causes an intestinal illness called cyclosporiasis from the consumption of contaminated food, mainly fresh produce, or contaminated water. the case numbers and the status of the investigation, which advances what we know about Cyclospora, based on the three key parts of every food outbreak investigation: Given the emerging nature of genetic typing methodologies for this parasite, the FDA has been unable to determine if the Cyclospora detected in the canal is a genetic match to the clinical cases, therefore, there is currently not enough evidence to conclusively determine the cause of this outbreak. The FDA has ways to detect the parasite that have been employed in this outbreak investigation, developing and validating new methods to test for Cyclospora in produce and agricultural water. The first of these new methods was used in 2018 to confirm the presence of the parasite in a salad mix product tied to an outbreak that sickened hundreds of people. In July 2019, the FDA made its second major advance in Cyclospora detection, completing studies that resulted in a novel, validated method to test agricultural water for the presence of the parasite. These new methods were developed by the Foodborne Parasitology Research Program that the FDA established in 2014 in our Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in part to break the cycle of recurring Cyclospora outbreaks. Strong federal and state coordination on matters of public health are critical. In identifying clinical cases of Cyclospora, assisting in providing traceback records and completing investigations in processing facilities and growing fields, our state partners’ work has proven essential to this investigation. We continue to work to strengthen these vital public health partnerships and federal agencies continue to work together to advance additional tools needed to assist with these investigations. For example, CDC is piloting the use of a genotyping tool to help identify cases of parasitic illness that might be linked to a common source. While we as public health agencies have gotten better at detecting foodborne illnesses due to Cyclospora, our ability to trace contaminated foods back to their source has lagged, and once again, our ability to trace has been a challenge in this investigation, due in part to the lack of modernized food traceability capabilities. Moreover, the detection of the parasite in surface waters near where product was grown once again puts a spotlight on the importance of managing the quality of irrigation water used to grow ready to eat crops. We are working closely with our colleagues at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to investigate this issue further to prevent future occurrences. These findings further emphasize the importance of industry’s role in ensuring that irrigation water is safe to be used on produce. Under the FDA’s recently released , we’ll continue to remain laser focused on prevention. In the coming months, we will be issuing a proposed rule that will aid in achieving our goal of enhancing traceability to greatly reduce the time it takes to identify the origin of a contaminated food or ingredient tied to a recall and/or outbreak. In addition, we intend to release a proposed rule in late 2020 to revise certain agricultural water requirements in the Produce Safety Rule and to address practical implementation challenges while protecting public health. We also plan to advance detection techniques that will help us pinpoint sources of Cyclospora outbreaks and to continue our research around water treatments for this parasite. In closing, we believe the entire fresh produce supply chain from farm to fork can do better and we look forward to continuing our work with our public health partners, growers, processors, distributors and retailers in our shared efforts to protect consumers. Together, we’ll make progress on our overarching goal to give consumers the confidence they deserve to have in the safety of fresh produce.

The number of reported cases of Cyclospora typically rises during May through August. Although CDC conducts surveillance for cyclosporiasis year-round, during the spring and summer months CDC conducts enhanced surveillance for cases of domestically acquired illness. In this outbreak, CDC has reported 690 cases across 13 states, with 37 hospitalizations and no deaths. Onsets of illness range from May 11, 2020 to July 20, 2020. Salads made by Fresh Express and containing iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots were identified as the food vehicle responsible for the outbreaks. of cases with the strongest sources of information (shopper card info, etc.) revealed that bagged salad codes most likely to have resulted in illness contained iceberg lettuce from California and red cabbage from Florida. The FDA evaluated and investigated each of the ingredients in the bagged salads, identifying red cabbage from Florida and iceberg lettuce from California as those most likely in the bagged salads consumed by people who became ill. Traceback investigations are time-consuming work but are critical. In this instance, in the wake of traceback and collaboration with the retailers to recall product, FDA identified a noticeable decline in illnesses that matched the time period in which cabbage sourcing shifted from Florida to another area, providing a possible clue in the investigation. detected the presence of Cyclospora in the surface water of a canal near a farm suspected of being a source of the red cabbage. Two samples collected to the north and south of where the farm accessed canal water for seepage irrigation were found to be positive for Cyclospora cayetanensis. The farm that supplied red cabbage was no longer in production at the conclusion of the growing season, so it was not possible to sample product. Additionally, the farms growing iceberg lettuce in California were investigated and all of the samples collected in California were negative for Cyclospora."},

This is the second drug and the first oral drug approved to treat this disease. SMA is a hereditary disease that causes weakness and muscle wasting because patients lose lower motor neurons (nerve cells) that control movement. Evrysdi contains a survival of motor neuron 2-directed RNA splicing modifier. The efficacy of Evrysdi for the treatment of patients with infantile-onset and later-onset SMA was evaluated in two clinical studies. The infantile-onset SMA study included 21 patients who had an average age of 6.7 months when the study began. In that open-label study, efficacy was established based on the ability to sit without support for at least five seconds and survival without permanent ventilation. After 12 months of treatment, 41% of patients were able to sit independently for more than five seconds, a meaningful difference from the natural progression of the disease because almost all untreated infants with infantile-onset SMA cannot sit independently. After 23 or more months of treatment, 81% of patients were alive without permanent ventilation, which is a noticeable improvement from typical disease progression without treatment. Patients with later-onset SMA were evaluated in a second randomized, placebo-controlled study. The study included 180 patients with SMA aged two to 25 years. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MFM32 (a test of motor function) total score at the one-year mark. Patients on Evrysdi saw an average 1.36 increase in their score at the one-year mark, compared to a 0.19 decrease in patients on placebo (inactive treatment). The most common side effects of Evrysdi include fever, diarrhea, rash, ulcers of the mouth area, joint pain (arthralgia) and urinary tract infections. Patients with infantile-onset SMA had similar side effects as individuals with later-onset SMA. Additional side effects for the infantile-onset population include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation and vomiting.

The protocol was developed through a collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Companies can now use data developed under this protocol to support the EPA registration of products that can treat agricultural water against foodborne bacteria, which could provide farmers with a useful tool to help protect the safety of produce intended for consumers, like romaine lettuce and other leafy greens. The announcement was made during a webinar on the FDA’s “This new protocol is a huge milestone for produce safety and for the Leafy Green Action Plan released by the FDA earlier this year. Working together, the FDA and EPA have supported the development of this protocol that may ultimately help farmers address contamination issues in their water sources and protect consumers from foodborne illness,” said FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response Frank Yiannas. “We must all work together to help ensure the safety of produce to consumers across the country. We will continue to work with our partners in industry, government and academia on this and other longer-term studies on the ecology of human pathogens in specific growing regions, and new efforts as part of the New Era of Smarter Food Safety Initiative.” “Thanks to the strong partnership between EPA and the FDA, we can now unleash the innovation needed to develop treatment products for the agricultural water used to irrigate our nation’s leafy greens,” said Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. “We look forward to working with pesticide product manufacturers, innovators, and farmers on this important development that will help protect public health and our environment.” EPA’s approval of this protocol allows for companies to develop data on the effectiveness of their products in inactivating foodborne bacteria, such as , in preharvest agricultural water. Companies may use the data developed to support registration of new treatment products, or amendments to current products’ labels, for use against microbial contamination in preharvest agricultural water. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of romaine lettuce and other leafy greens have highlighted the need for a viable option for treating agricultural water against foodborne pathogens. While farmers are not required to treat their agricultural water, these treatments could be a valuable tool to help farmers protect the safety of their produce. There currently are no registered antimicrobial treatment products that are authorized for use on agricultural fields, or for treatment of irrigation water systems or ponds. This protocol is an important step toward addressing this lack of available treatments for preharvest agricultural water. Teams of FDA experts have been working collaboratively with partners in the public and private sectors to help protect agricultural water from the many ways it can be contaminated in the environment or from unsanitary practices on a farm. This effort has included hundreds of farm visits over the past few years. In addition, the FDA intends to release a proposed rule in late 2020, to revise certain agricultural water requirements in the Produce Safety Rule and to address practical implementation challenges while protecting public health. The development and approval of this treatment protocol is one of several steps the agency has taken or intends to take to help improve produce safety, such as through the Leafy Green Action Plan and through the New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Liquid Biopsy Next-Generation Sequencing Companion Diagnostic Test", "date": "August 07, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first liquid biopsy companion diagnostic that also uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify patients with specific types of mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in a deadly form of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is the first approval to combine two technologies — NGS and liquid biopsy — in one diagnostic test in order to guide treatment decisions. The Guardant360 CDx assay utilizes two technologies. The first is called liquid biopsy, which uses a blood sample to provide health care professionals with genetic information about the patient’s tumor. It is less invasive and more easily repeatable in comparison to standard tissue biopsies. Furthermore, liquid biopsy tests can be used in cases in which standard tissue biopsies are not feasible, for instance, due to the location of the tumor. The second technology is NGS, which uses large-panel genetic sequencing, known as high-throughput tumor profiling. Compared to older technologies, NGS requires only one test in order to allow clinicians better assessment of tumor composition, giving providers an advantage in evaluating which mutations are problematic. The Guardant360 CDx assay uses NGS technology to simultaneously detect mutations in 55 tumor genes, rather than one gene at a time. The Guardant360CDx is approved both to provide information on multiple solid tumor biomarkers and to help identify EGFR mutations in patients who will benefit from treatment with TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an FDA-approved therapy for a form of metastatic NSCLC. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the United States, and NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer. Genomic findings for other biomarkers evaluated are not validated for choosing a particular corresponding treatment with this approval. If the specific NSCLC mutations associated with today’s approval are not detected in the blood, then a tumor biopsy should be performed to determine if the NSCLC mutations are present. The Guardant360 CDx assay was granted a Breakthrough Device designation, in which the FDA provides intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development.

{"title": "FDA Announces Voluntary Agreement with Manufacturers to Phase Out Certain Short-Chain PFAS Used in Food Packaging", "date": "July 31, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is that the manufacturers of certain used for grease-proofing in paper and paperboard for food packaging (for example, as coatings on some fast-food wrappers, to-go boxes, and pizza boxes) have voluntarily agreed to phase-out their sales of these substances for use as food contact substances in the United States. This action follows new analyses of data that raised questions about potential human health risks from chronic dietary exposure – findings that warrant further study. This phase-out balances uncertainty about the potential for public health risks with minimizing potential market disruptions to food packaging supply chains during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Earlier this year, FDA scientists their analyses of studies on certain PFAS used in food packaging. Their analyses of data from rodent studies raised questions about a subset of short-chain PFAS that contain 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6:2 FTOH) because of evidence of biopersistence of 6:2 FTOH. While the findings were from studies in rodents, and at higher doses than we would expect in humans, the data suggest the potential of 6:2 FTOH to also persist in humans from chronic dietary exposure. Further scientific studies are needed to better understand the potential human health risks from dietary exposure to food contact substances that contain 6:2 FTOH. Beginning in January 2021, three manufacturers will begin a 3-year phase-out of their sales of certain substances that contain 6:2 FTOH for use as food contact substances in the U.S. marketplace. After the phase-out period, it is anticipated that it may take up to 18 months to exhaust existing stocks of paper and paperboard products containing these food contact substances from the market. A fourth manufacturer informed the FDA in 2019 that they have stopped sales of their short-chain PFAS products in the U.S. market. The four manufacturers of these short-chain grease-proofing agents previously obtained authorization for the use of these substances in food contact paper packaging applications through the process. This pre-market scientific review ensures that food contact substances (FCSs) are safe for their intended use, based on the scientific data that is available at the time of submission. As part of fulfilling the FDA’s public health mission, the agency continued to review the latest data and science regarding these short-chain grease-proofing agents and engaged with the manufacturers on the new analyses that informed the voluntary phase-out being announced today. We will monitor the progress of the phase-out of these short-chain grease-proofing agents through annual updates provided by the three remaining manufacturers.

{"title": "FDA Clarifies Types of Evidence Relevant to Determining the “Intended Use” of FDA-Regulated Products", "date": "September 22, 2020", "contents": " Today, we proposed updates to our regulations to clarify the types of evidence the FDA considers when determining the “intended use” of a product. A product’s intended use determines whether it is a medical product within the scope of FDA’s jurisdiction. This proposed rule, is an important step forward in fulfilling our public health mission and our promise to provide better clarity to regulated industry and other stakeholders. The proposed revisions to the intended use regulations do not reflect a change in the FDA’s policies and practices, but rather seek to clarify the regulatory language describing the types of evidence we consider relevant to determining a product’s intended uses. The purpose of our proposal is to update our regulations to better reflect the FDA’s longstanding approach to intended use and provide greater clarity for regulated parties. FDA's longstanding position is that, in evaluating a product's intended use, any relevant source of evidence may be considered. This longstanding position remains unchanged in the regulations being proposed today. However, the proposed revisions clarify an important point: that a firm’s knowledge that a health care provider has prescribed or used an approved or cleared medical product for an unapproved use, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish the product’s intended use. We believe that this update will provide greater certainty and predictability for regulated parties. In the preamble to the proposed rule, we provide additional clarity by describing examples of types of evidence we would consider relevant to determining the intended use of a product, including a variety of direct and circumstantial evidence. The preamble also outlines several examples of types of evidence that, standing alone, would not be determinative of intended use. We believe these examples will help regulated parties to navigate common scenarios with greater certainty. In recent years, we have worked to revise certain language that is currently included in our intended use regulations and that does not accurately reflect current FDA policies. In 2015, we issued a that, among other things, would have revised that language. The agency considered the feedback and support we received on the proposed rule and made additional changes when we published the . In light of questions and concerns that arose from the changes made in the final rule, FDA decided to of the relevant portion of that 2017 final rule until further notice, to allow for additional consideration of the substantive issues raised in the public comments we received related to the final rule. Since then, we have considered the issues raised by the 2017 final rule, including feedback and input from regulated industry and other stakeholders, and we are now proposing to repeal and replace the intended use portion of the 2017 final rule. We received many useful comments that assisted in our policy development. Public comment is an important part of the rulemaking process that can inform and influence the agency on critical regulatory matters. We look forward to receiving input on today’s proposed rule. We believe that by revising the text of our intended use regulations to better reflect our longstanding practice, and by providing additional examples and explanation in the preamble, we will give clarity to stakeholders and enhance consistency in our regulatory approach. Such clarity and consistency are critical to ensuring that parties understand their regulatory obligations and that the FDA can exercise effective oversight responsibility. For this reason, this rulemaking is an important priority for the FDA.

{"title": "National Survey Shows Encouraging Decline in Overall Youth E-Cigarette Use, Concerning Uptick in Use of Disposable Products", "date": "September 09, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released new data from the , which show 1.8 million fewer U.S. youth are currently using e-cigarettes compared to 2019. After two years of disturbing increases in youth e-cigarette use, we are encouraged by the overall significant decline reported in 2020. This is good news; however, the FDA remains very concerned about the 3.6 million U.S. youth who currently use e-cigarettes and we acknowledge there is work that still needs to be done to curb youth use. Youth use of e-cigarettes remains a public health crisis that is affecting children, families, schools and communities, and we will do everything possible to stop it – including new actions we are taking today. The findings come as we mark today’s , a milestone for ensuring new tobacco products, including many already on the market, undergo a robust scientific evaluation by the FDA. Scientific review of new products is a critical part of how we carry out our mission to protect the public—especially kids—from the harms associated with tobacco use. Companies must demonstrate that each product meets the applicable statutory criteria for receiving marketing authorization, such as whether marketing the product is appropriate for the protection of the public health. In such cases, the FDA may assess, among other things, how particular e-cigarettes or other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) could help addicted adult smokers seeking to transition away from cigarettes, while also weighing the concerning popularity of these products with young people. The FDA has been to ensure that we are as prepared as possible to receive, process, and review the applications in a timely manner. In addition to the critical premarket scientific review of tobacco products, taking enforcement actions against those who violate the law remains a vital way we protect public health. Following today’s deadline, the FDA will be prioritizing enforcement against any ENDS product that continues to be sold and for which the agency has not received a product application. Additionally, based on several factors – including the likelihood of youth use or initiation – the FDA will make the best use of agency resources to enforce against any other deemed new tobacco product that does not have the required premarket authorization, though as the result of a court decision, the FDA will not be enforcing this requirement for “premium” cigars. In line with its enforcement priorities, today the FDA issued notifying three companies who sell or distribute unauthorized ENDS products to remove those products from the market. The FDA issued a warning letter to XL Vape LLC (doing business as Stig Inc.), a popular disposable e-cigarette brand among youth, warning the company to remove their disposable e-cigarettes from the market because they do not have the required premarket authorization. Additional warning letters were issued today to Flavour Warehouse LTD (doing business as Vampire Vape) and Pretty Women UK LTD (T/A Coil2oil and Mad Kingdom Liquids) for illegally marketing unauthorized menthol-flavored e-liquids. The labeling and/or advertising of these products also features cartoon images, such as vampires and kings, that are commonly marketed and/or appeal to youth. These actions come as the 2020 NYTS data shows an alarming uptick in use of disposable e-cigarettes by youth. Specifically, in 2020, disposable e-cigarettes are being used by 26.5% of high school e-cigarette users (up from 2.4% in 2019) and 15.2% of middle school e-cigarette users (up from 3% in 2019). Furthermore, more than 8 out of 10 youth e-cigarette users report use of flavored products, with fruit, mint, candy, and menthol among the most commonly used. This is the first year in which the NYTS distinguished between mint and menthol products; in previous years’ surveys, youth were asked questions in which products were identified as “mint/menthol” and not further delineated. The warning letters issued today underscore our concern with the rise in youth use of disposable e-cigarettes and the notable use of menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. As we have said many times, the FDA will take action against any ENDS product—regardless of whether it is cartridge-based, disposable, flavored, or otherwise—if it is targeted to kids, if its marketing is likely to promote use by minors, or if the manufacturer fails to take adequate measures to prevent youth access. The agency’s actions demonstrate that the FDA will continue to aggressively respond to this public health crisis based on evolving data. This new data will inform the FDA’s enforcement and other actions, and flavored disposable ENDS will be an enforcement priority for the agency. Our message to companies that sell youth-appealing products without marketing authorization is that they risk action by the FDA. And we are prepared to take additional actions in the future to hold companies accountable for marketing any e-cigarette products that are appealing to youth. These warning letters are just the latest in the series of actions the FDA has taken in the past weeks and months to help ensure that youth do not begin using any tobacco product. In late July, the agency issued to 10 companies, including Puff Bar, warning the companies to remove their flavored disposable e-cigarettes and youth-appealing e-liquid products from the market because they lack the required premarket authorization. The agency is working to ensure these illegally marketed products are no longer sold, and that the products will not be reintroduced on the market until the companies have applied for and if they receive marketing authorization from the FDA. We are committed to addressing the public health crisis of youth e-cigarette use by, among other things, focusing product review and enforcement on youth-appealing products and investing in about the dangers of e-cigarette use. We will remain vigilant in monitoring the marketplace, expanding our public education efforts and using our regulatory authority – changing course as necessary – to further ensure all tobacco products, and e-cigarettes in particular, are not marketed to, sold to, or used by kids. If we see a product that is targeted to kids, we will not hesitate to target that product.

Recovery was defined as either being discharged from the hospital or being hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery from COVID-19 was 10 days for the Veklury group compared to 15 days for the placebo group, a statistically significant difference. Overall, the odds of clinical improvement at Day 15 were also statistically significantly higher in the Veklury group when compared to the placebo group. A second randomized, open-label multi-center of hospitalized adult subjects with moderate COVID-19 compared treatment with Veklury for five days (n=191) and treatment with Veklury for 10 days (n=193) with standard of care (n=200). Researchers evaluated the clinical status of subjects on Day 11. Overall, the odds of a subject’s COVID-19 symptoms improving were statistically significantly higher in the five-day Veklury group at Day 11 when compared to those receiving only standard of care. The odds of improvement with the 10-day treatment group when compared to those receiving only standard of care were numerically favorable, but not statistically significantly different. A third separate, randomized, open-label multi-center of hospitalized adult subjects with severe COVID-19 compared treatment with Veklury for five days (n= 200) and treatment with Veklury for 10 days (n= 197). Researchers evaluated the clinical status of subjects on Day 14. Overall, the odds of a subject’s COVID-19 symptoms improving were similar for those in the five-day Veklury group as those in the 10-day Veklury group, and there were no statistically significant differences in recovery rates or mortality rates between the two groups. Important information about using Veklury to treat COVID-19 for its approved use is available in the prescribing information which includes dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects include: increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury; and allergic reactions, which may include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, low blood oxygen level, fever, shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling (e.g., lips, around eyes, under the skin), rash, nausea, sweating or shivering. Similar safety information about using Veklury to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized pediatric patients under the EUA is available in the fact sheets for The FDA granted this application designations. The Agency also granted this application a , which provides additional incentives for certain medical products intended to treat or prevent harm from specific chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

{"title": "FDA Approves Drug Combination for Treating Mesothelioma ", "date": "October 02, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adults with malignant pleural mesothelioma that cannot be removed by surgery. This is the first drug regimen approved for mesothelioma in 16 years and the second FDA-approved systemic therapy for mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a life-threatening cancer of the lungs’ lining caused by inhaling asbestos fibers that about 20,000 Americans are diagnosed with each year. MPM accounts for most mesothelioma diagnoses, and most patients have an unresectable (unable to be removed with surgery) tumor at time of diagnosis. With currently available therapy, overall survival is generally poor. Opdivo and Yervoy are both monoclonal antibodies that, when combined, decrease tumor growth by enhancing T-cell function. This combination therapy was evaluated during a randomized, open-label trial in 605 patients with previously untreated unresectable MPM. Patients received intravenous infusions of Opdivo every two weeks with intravenous infusions of Yervoy every six weeks for up to two years, or platinum-doublet chemotherapy for up to six cycles. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion of two years. The objective was to determine if Opdivo in combination with Yervoy improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy. At the time of the analysis, patients who received Opdivo in combination with Yervoy survived a median of 18.1 months while patients who underwent chemotherapy survived a median of 14.1 months. The most common side effects of Opdivo in combination with Yervoy in patients with MPM include: fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), nausea, decreased appetite, cough and pruritis (itching). Yervoy can cause serious conditions known as immune-mediated side effects, including inflammation of healthy organs, such as the lungs (pneumonitis), colon (colitis), liver (hepatitis), endocrine glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis). Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they have immune system problems, lung or breathing problems, liver problems, have had an organ transplant, or are pregnant or plan to become pregnant before starting treatment. The FDA granted approval to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This review was conducted under , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners. For this review, FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), Health Canada, and Switzerland’s Swissmedic. The application reviews are ongoing at the other regulatory agencies. FDA approval occurred approximately 5 months ahead of the goal date.

{"title": "FDA Approves Lotion for Nonprescription Use to Treat Head Lice ", "date": "October 27, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a lotion to treat head lice for nonprescription, or over-the-counter (OTC), use through a process called a prescription (Rx)-to-OTC switch. The FDA initially approved Sklice (ivermectin) lotion, 0.5% for the treatment of head lice infestation in patients 6 months of age and older as a prescription drug in February 2012. Rx-to-OTC switches are generally initiated by the manufacturer of the prescription drug. For a drug to switch from prescription to nonprescription status, the data provided must demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective when used as directed in the proposed labeling. The manufacturer must show that consumers can understand how to use the drug safely and effectively without the supervision of a healthcare professional. In the United States, it is estimated that between 6 and 12 million cases of head lice infestation occur each year in children 3 to 11 years of age, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Head lice are most common among preschool children attending child care, elementary school children and members of a household where children have lice. Sklice is a single-use lotion with ivermectin 0.5% as the active ingredient, for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients 6 months of age and older. Sklice is for external use only and should only be used on the scalp and dry hair in accordance with label directions. Sklice is not approved for any other use. Sklice will be marketed in the United States as a nonprescription drug and will no longer be available as a prescription drug. Consumers should read and follow the Drug Facts label for the nonprescription product. Patients who currently use prescription versions of this product should talk to their healthcare professional. The FDA granted the approval of nonprescription Sklice (ivermectin) lotion, 0.5% for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients 6 months of age and older to Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC.

When there is an inadequate adverse event reporting process, the ability to detect problems and address them in order to assure the safety and performance of decontaminated respirators is compromised,” said Binita Ashar, M.D., director of the Office of Surgical and Infection Control Devices in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We will hold companies accountable if they fail to fulfill their regulatory obligations.” The Battelle Memorial Institute’s Critical Care Decontamination System is authorized under an FDA EUA for use in decontaminating certain N95 respirators for reuse by health care personnel when there are insufficient supplies of Filtering Facepiece Respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA sent a letter in August to Battelle Memorial Institute requesting information about their process for submitting reportable adverse events to the FDA after the FDA became aware that there may be deficiencies in Battelle’s process. In this letter, the FDA provided examples of reportable events that may be relevant to the authorized product including allergic reactions or eye, mouth or nose irritation, evidence that a decontaminated respirator is unable to perform its essential function, events related to hydrogen peroxide residuals or user contact with hydrogen peroxide residuals, infection in respirator wearers, or malfunctions of the generator used to decontaminate the respirators. Pursuant to the conditions of the EUA, Battelle Memorial Institute must have a process in place to report adverse events as specified in the EUA. Based on the information received from Battelle, the FDA determined that this condition has not been met. As such, the FDA issued this WL and has requested a response from Battelle Memorial Institute within 15 working days with details about how the company will correct the violations. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Intratumoral Injection to Treat Non-Metastatic Mast Cell Tumors in Dogs", "date": "November 16, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Stelfonta (tigilanol tiglate injection) to treat dogs with non-metastatic, skin-based (cutaneous) mast cell tumors (MCTs). The FDA is also approving Stelfonta to treat non-metastatic MCTs located under the dog’s skin (subcutaneous), in particular areas of a dog’s leg.  Stelfonta is injected directly into the MCT (intratumoral injection). Stelfonta works by activating a protein that spreads throughout the treated tumor, which disintegrates tumor cells. MCTs are the most common malignant skin tumor in dogs, and usually present as a lump on or under the skin. Full surgical removal of mast cell tumors can be difficult when tumors are located in certain areas, such as the leg. When mast cell tumors are not fully removed, the remaining malignant cells can start to grow and spread rapidly. Stelfonta offers a novel way to treat non-metastatic MCTs as the only approved intratumoral injection. Stelfonta is available only by prescription due to the professional expertise required to diagnose MCTs, properly administer the injection, provide adequate instructions for post treatment care, and monitor the safe use of the product, including treatment of any adverse reactions. The label for Stelfonta carries a boxed warning for human safety because of the risk of severe wound formation from accidental self-injection or needle stick injuries. The boxed warning also includes several statements regarding the safe use of Stelfonta in dogs, including: Stelfonta should always be given with a corticosteroid, an H1 receptor blocking agent and an H2 receptor blocking agent, to decrease the risk of severe systemic adverse reactions, including death, from mast cell degranulation. Veterinarians should provide the client information sheet to pet owners for important information about Stelfonta and how to care for their pets after they have been given the drug. The safety and effectiveness of Stelfonta was established in a study of 118 dogs with a measurable cutaneous or a subcutaneous MCT on the lower leg. Eighty of those dogs were treated with Stelfonta and 38 were in an untreated control group. The dogs were followed and tumor response was assessed almost a month after their first injection. The complete remission rate after treatment with Stelfonta was 75%. Eighteen dogs in the group treated with Stelfonta that didn’t have their treated tumor completely disappear were retreated with Stelfonta a second time about a month after the first treatment, and approximately a month after receiving their second treatment, 44% of these dogs had their tumor disappear completely. Dogs in the untreated control group were treated with Stelfonta for the first time a month after the study began, and 62% of those dogs had their tumor disappear. Stelfonta should not be used to treat subcutaneous MCTs located above the elbow or hock. Stelfonta may cause extensive wound formation at the tumor site, including cellulitis and severe tissue sloughing. The most common adverse reactions associated with Stelfonta were wound formation at the tumor site and injection site reactions, such as pain, swelling, reddening of the skin, bruising, thickening, scarring, and death of some cells in the tissues. Lameness in the treated leg, vomiting, diarrhea, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia also occurred. These were likely due to the wound healing process and the drug’s effect on the tumor. Most wounds gradually reduced in size or completely resolved. A small number of dogs developed extensive wounds with cellulitis, bacterial skin infections, or severe tissue sloughing that extended away from the treated tumor which led to a prolonged recovery time and additional wound care. The FDA granted approval of Stelfonta to QBiotics Group Ltd.

{"title": "COVID-19 Update: FDA’s Ongoing Commitment to Transparency for COVID-19 EUAs", "date": "November 17, 2020", "contents": " Emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, are an important tool in our country’s fight against COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. While EUAs have received increased attention during the COVID-19 public health emergency, EUAs are not a new tool to the FDA. I want to take a moment to reaffirm FDA’s commitment to transparency around the EUA process and share some updates on our plan to provide more information about FDA’s decisions to issue, revise or revoke EUAs for drugs and biological products, including vaccines. Earlier this year, we launched the COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery and Preparedness Plan (PREPP) to help apply best practices and lessons learned from the emergency response to date. Our goal is to optimize the ongoing COVID-19 response, while also strengthening our resilience and improving our capacity to respond to future public health emergencies. As part of our overall preparedness and response work, including PREPP, we have focused on opportunities for further transparency. In particular, we recognize that disclosing information from the scientific review documents supporting the issuance, revision or revocation of EUAs for drugs and biological products, including vaccines, will contribute to the public’s confidence in the agency’s rigorous review of scientific data and the appropriate use of authorized products. As such, I am announcing today that our drug and biological product centers intend, to the extent appropriate and permitted by law, to publicly post their reviews of the scientific data and information supporting the issuance, revision or revocation of EUAs for all drug and biological products, including vaccines, as part of our COVID-19 response. We have already posted some scientific review documents, for instance for an as well as an , and we are committing to continuing to post these documents moving forward. Consistent with FDA’s longstanding practice of posting the relevant scientific reviews after new drug and biological product approvals, we will disclose information from EUA review documents as appropriate after our disclosure review and process is complete. As a part of this process, the FDA may redact certain information that is protected from disclosure under the law. The redacted information may vary depending on the type of data contained in the reviews and whether the requestor consents to the release of information that is protected from disclosure under the law. We know that EUAs can be crucial to facilitate frontline health care providers’ access to potentially life-saving products for their patients, if those providers determine the EUA products are appropriate for their patients to use. To help health care providers understand the benefits, risks and proper use of FDA-authorized products, we have already been posting helpful information such as the letter of authorization to the requestor (which spells out the conditions under which use of the product is authorized), fact sheets for patients, fact sheets for health care providers and instructions for use. When appropriate, we have translated these materials into other languages to ensure the information is more broadly accessible. Altogether, these documents provide helpful information and transparency to the public. The additional transparency that we are announcing today, in addition to information we already provide, will help inform providers. Let me also take a step back to explain why EUAs are such a unique and important public health tool during an emergency. The EUA process, which comes from authority that Congress gave the FDA after the attacks of September 11, 2001, can be applied to a variety of emergency situations, including pandemics like COVID-19. The EUA process allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in appropriate circumstances, to declare that EUAs are justified for products to respond to certain types of threats. When such a declaration is made, the FDA may issue an “authorization,” which is different from our approval process for drugs and biologics, including vaccines.  Under the EUA process, in emergency situations when there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives, the FDA has the authority to authorize medical products for use under specified conditions before all the evidence that would be needed for full FDA approval is available. In considering EUA requests, the agency promptly and carefully evaluates the totality of the scientific evidence that is available on the product’s safety and effectiveness to determine whether the medical product may be effective for its proposed authorized uses. As part of its overall EUA evaluation, the FDA must also determine that the product's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks. Let me be clear on a crucial point – the issuance of an EUA is based on data and science. For an EUA to be authorized, FDA’s career scientists conduct a rigorous evaluation of currently available scientific evidence about a medical product. We work with sponsors so that additional data about the product’s safety and effectiveness continue to be collected and reviewed. If the available scientific evidence changes or if new information becomes available, we can pivot and potentially adapt the EUA, including revising the authorized use or revoking the EUA. These are both steps that we have taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today’s transparency action is just one of a number of steps we are taking to ensure public confidence in our EUA review process for drugs and biological products, especially any potential COVID-19 vaccines. For example, as part of our commitment to COVID-19 vaccine transparency, we convened FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for an open committee meeting to discuss generally the development, licensure and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines. While no specific application was discussed at this meeting, we have stated publicly that we will promptly schedule additional meetings of the VRBPAC upon submission of an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to discuss whether the available safety and effectiveness data support issuance of an EUA. We’re also creating educational materials to help the public understand the different regulatory and scientific steps around vaccine or drug development, including explaining the , the role of , and more. We will continue to help expedite the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19, providing rapid feedback and technical advice to sponsors and researchers, without sacrificing our standards for quality, safety and effectiveness that all can rely on. We will also continue to follow the science and ensure that science remains the driver of the agency’s regulatory decision-making in our fight against COVID-19 and beyond on behalf of public health.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Issues New Policy on Dry Heat for Reuse of Certain Respirators", "date": "November 25, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued on the use of dry heat to help support the single-user reuse of certain particulate filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), such as N95 respirators, by health care personnel when there is a limited supply of respirators during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The immediately-in-effect guidance provides the FDA’s thinking and recommendations regarding the use of bioburden reduction systems that use dry heat to reduce the bioburden, or amount of microorganisms present, on certain respirators for reuse by a single user. Bioburden reduction systems are intended to achieve a certain level in microbial reduction on a device; these are not decontamination systems. Additionally, these systems should only be used in conjunction with existing for FFR reuse. Under this policy, the FDA does not intend to object to the use of certain dry heat systems for the purpose of reducing bioburden and supporting single-user reuse of otherwise disposable FFRs that are compatible with dry heat bioburden reduction systems without marketing authorization. Manufacturers should follow the system settings for bioburden reduction—such as temperature and time—and labeling recommended in this guidance, and also follow existing CDC reuse recommendations, such as storing the respirator in a breathable paper bag for a minimum of five days between each use and limiting the number of wears to no more than five per respirator. The FDA has issued for certain decontamination systems for decontaminating compatible FFRs, and has issued guidance to provide recommendations for sponsors requesting EUAs for decontamination and bioburden reduction systems for surgical masks and respirators. However, today’s guidance is the first enforcement policy guidance specifically for bioburden reduction systems for FFRs. To date, no EUAs have been issued for bioburden reduction systems that use dry heat. While dry heat bioburden reduction systems do not provide FFR decontamination, which is a higher level of microbial reduction, these systems may still be sufficient to reduce bioburden on compatible FFRs and support single-user reuse of these respirators by supplementing existing CDC reuse recommendations. This policy applies to bioburden reduction of FFRs that do not have exhalation valves, do not incorporate a duck-bill design, and do not contain antimicrobial/antiviral agents and that 1) have been FDA-cleared, or 2) have been FDA-authorized under the EUA for CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved FFRs, or 3) have been FDA-authorized under the EUA for imported, non-NIOSH-approved FFRs that are not manufactured in China. The FDA is considering revising the scope of authorization of the above mentioned FFR EUAs to include bioburden reduction under certain circumstances. At this time, FFRs that have had bioburden reduction with one of these systems are not authorized under an existing EUA. Currently, there are no FDA-cleared or approved devices for decontamination or bioburden reduction of respirators.

{"title": "FDA Approves First PSMA-Targeted PET Imaging Drug for Men with Prostate Cancer", "date": "December 01, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gallium 68 PSMA-11 (Ga 68 PSMA-11) – the first drug for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer. Ga 68 PSMA-11 is indicated for patients with suspected prostate cancer metastasis (when cancer cells spread from the place where they first formed to another part of the body) who are potentially curable by surgery or radiation therapy. Ga 68 PSMA-11 is also indicated for patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Ga 68 PSMA-11 is a radioactive diagnostic agent that is administered in the form of an intravenous injection. Prostate cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the United States. It is estimated that there will be more than 190,000 new cases of prostate cancer and an estimated 33,000 deaths from this disease in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute. While computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and bone scans are conventional methods commonly used to image patients with prostate cancer, these approaches are limited in detection of prostate cancer lesions. F 18 fluciclovine and C 11 choline are two other PET drugs that are approved for prostate cancer imaging. However, they are only approved for use in patients with suspected cancer recurrence. Once administered via injection, Ga 68 PSMA-11 binds to PSMA, which is an important pharmacologic target for prostate cancer imaging because prostate cancer cells usually contain elevated levels of the antigen. As a radioactive drug that emits positrons, Ga 68 PSMA-11 can be imaged by PET to indicate the presence of PSMA-positive prostate cancer lesions in the tissues of the body. The safety and efficacy of Ga 68 PSMA-11 were evaluated in two prospective clinical trials with a total of 960 men with prostate cancer who each received one injection of Ga 68 PSMA-11. In the first trial, 325 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent PET/CT or PET/MRI scans performed with Ga 68 PSMA-11. These patients were candidates for surgical removal of the prostate gland and pelvic lymph nodes and were considered at higher risk for metastasis. Among the patients who proceeded to surgery, those with positive readings in the pelvic lymph nodes on Ga 68 PSMA-11 PET had a clinically important rate of metastatic cancer confirmed by surgical pathology. The availability of this information prior to treatment is expected to have important implications for patient care. For example, it may spare certain patients from undergoing unnecessary surgery. The second trial enrolled 635 patients who had rising serum PSA levels after initial prostate surgery or radiotherapy, and thus had biochemical evidence of recurrent prostate cancer. All of these patients received a single Ga 68 PSMA-11 PET/CT scan or PET/MR scan. Based on the scans, 74% of these patients had at least one positive lesion detected by Ga 68 PSMA-11 PET in at least one body region (bone, prostate bed, pelvic lymph node, or extra-pelvic soft tissue). In patients with positive Ga 68 PSMA-11 PET readings who had correlative tissue pathology from biopsies, results from baseline or follow-up imaging by conventional methods, and serial PSA levels available for comparison, local recurrence or metastasis of prostate cancer was confirmed in an estimated 91% of cases. Thus, the second trial demonstrated that Ga 68 PSMA-11 PET can detect sites of disease in patients with biochemical evidence of recurrent prostate cancer, thereby providing important information that may impact the approach to therapy. No serious adverse reactions were attributed to Ga 68 PSMA-11. The most common adverse reactions to Ga 68 PSMA-11 were nausea, diarrhea and dizziness. There is a risk for misdiagnosis because Ga 68 PSMA-11 binding may occur in other types of cancer as well as certain non-malignant processes which may lead to image interpretation errors. There are radiation risks because Ga 68 PSMA-11 contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer.

The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is a molecular (real-time loop mediated amplification reaction) single use test that is intended to detect the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit test has been authorized for home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals age 14 and older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. It is also authorized for use in point-of-care (POC) settings (e.g., doctor’s offices, hospitals, urgent care centers and emergency rooms) for all ages but samples must be collected by a healthcare provider when the test is used at the POC to test individuals younger than 14 years old. The test is currently authorized for prescription use only. The test works by swirling the self-collected sample swab in a vial that is then placed in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display that shows whether a person is positive or negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Positive results indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Individuals with positive results should self-isolate and seek additional care from their health care provider. Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider as negative results do not preclude an individual from SARS-CoV-2 infection. An important component to successful at-home testing is the ability to efficiently track and monitor results. As noted in this EUA, prescribing health care providers are required to report all test results they receive from individuals who use the test to their relevant public health authorities in accordance with local, state and federal requirements. Lucira Health, the test manufacturer, has also developed box labeling, quick reference instructions and health care provider instructions to assist with reporting. Diagnostic testing remains one of the pillars of our nation’s response to COVID-19.

As part of this continued commitment, today we are releasing a new tool to communicate foodborne illness outbreak information frequently and as soon as the FDA begins an outbreak investigation – prior to a public health advisory or recall of a certain food product being issued. Today our FDA investigation team, the , is starting the ongoing publication of a new that will include information on all foodborne outbreaks for which the FDA has initiated an investigation. The table, which will be updated on a weekly basis, will include information about each stage of an outbreak investigation. Currently, a public is issued for any outbreak investigation that results in specific, actionable steps consumers can take to protect themselves such as a recommendation to not eat a certain type of food or recalled food product. This practice will remain the same. This new tool will allow the FDA to share information with the public even earlier in the process. However, it is important to note that during the early phases of an investigation, there may not be any specific action that consumers can take while information is being gathered and the investigation develops. For example, in the early stages of an investigation, we may not know what specific commodity or food vehicle is responsible for the illnesses and the time frame in which it was available for purchase. This information is crucial to the development of accurate public health messages to help protect consumers from exposure to potentially contaminated food and enable retailers and consumers to take appropriate actions. The outbreak investigation table is a demonstration of our continued commitment to more frequent and transparent communication with stakeholders and consumers about outbreaks we’re investigating. We have already taken steps to release information early, in some cases prior to a specific food being linked to an outbreak, including in our recent on investigations into three ongoing E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks. We promised to soon take additional action to release information about outbreaks at the earliest stages of an investigation, and with the release of this new tool, as well as other efforts under our initiative, we’re doing just that. Although we won’t have all the information in the early phases of a foodborne illness outbreak investigation and often there isn’t specific actionable information for consumers, we believe that sharing what information we have early via this new table is crucial because it gives consumers and stakeholders an awareness of outbreaks being investigated by the FDA. As our investigations unfold, we will continue to develop our communication, including continued issuance of public health advisories or recalls when appropriate. In the interim, we recommend that consumers regularly consult our The FDA remains deeply committed to the safety of foods, whether produced domestically or imported from abroad.

Both FSMA and the New Era are focused on transforming the nation’s food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness to preventing it. Paired with these ongoing efforts, the release of our new outbreak investigation table represents our ongoing commitment to the American people that we will work as fast and effectively as we can to communicate timely, early updates about our outbreak investigations and other ongoing efforts focused on protecting the public.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Drug Combination for Treatment of COVID-19", "date": "November 19, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an for the drug baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In a clinical trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, was shown to reduce time to recovery within 29 days after initiating treatment compared to patients who received a placebo with remdesivir. The safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy for use in the treatment of COVID-19 continues to be evaluated. Baricitinib is not authorized or approved as a stand-alone treatment for COVID-19. Baricitinib is a janus kinase inhibitor, which blocks the activity of one or more of a specific family of enzymes, interfering with the pathway that leads to inflammation. Baricitinib is a prescription oral tablet medication that is FDA-approved (and sold under the brand name Olumiant) for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Under today’s EUA, the FDA is authorizing the emergency use of baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, for the treatment of certain hospitalized patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Remdesivir is an (and sold under the brand name Veklury) intravenous antiviral drug for use in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Remdesivir also remains authorized for emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg (about 7.7 pounds) to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, may be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized population. And, when used under the conditions described in the EUA to treat COVID-19, the known and potential benefits of baricitinib outweigh the known and potential risks for the drug. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to baricitinib, when used in combination with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. The data supporting this EUA for baricitinib combined with remdesivir are based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ACTT-2), which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This clinical trial evaluated whether baricitinib impacted how long it took for subjects who were also taking remdesivir to recover from COVID-19. The trial followed patients for 29 days and included 1,033 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19; 515 patients received baricitinib plus remdesivir, and 518 patients received placebo plus remdesivir. Recovery was defined as either being discharged from the hospital or being hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery from COVID-19 was seven days for baricitinib plus remdesivir and eight days for placebo plus remdesivir. The odds of a patient’s condition progressing to death or being ventilated at day 29 was lower in the baricitinib plus remdesivir group versus the placebo plus remdesivir group. The odds of clinical improvement at day 15 was higher in the baricitinib plus remdesivir group versus the placebo plus remdesivir group. For all of these endpoints, the effects were statistically significant. Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in treating COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to . These fact sheets include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir include serious infections, blood clots, changes in certain lab test results and allergic reactions.

{"title": "FDA Statement on Following the Authorized Dosing Schedules for COVID-19 Vaccines", "date": "January 04, 2021", "contents": " Two different mRNA vaccines have now shown remarkable effectiveness of about 95% in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults. As the first round of vaccine recipients become eligible to receive their second dose, we want to remind the public about the importance of receiving COVID-19 vaccines according to how they’ve been authorized by the FDA in order to safely receive the level of protection observed in the large randomized trials supporting their effectiveness. We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19. These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19. The available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 21 days between the first and second dose. And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose. What we have seen is that the data in the firms’ submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted. In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively. Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies. Using a single dose regimen and/or administering less than the dose studied in the clinical trials without understanding the nature of the depth and duration of protection that it provides is concerning, as there is some indication that the depth of the immune response is associated with the duration of protection provided. If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks. We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster. However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health. We have committed time and time again to make decisions based on data and science. Until vaccine manufacturers have data and science supporting a change, we continue to strongly recommend that health care providers follow the FDA-authorized dosing schedule for each COVID-19 vaccine.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Monoclonal Antibody for Treatment of COVID-19", "date": "November 09, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients. Bamlanivimab is authorized for patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions. While the safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy continues to be evaluated, bamlanivimab was shown in clinical trials to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to placebo. Bamlanivimab is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. A benefit of bamlanivimab treatment has not been shown in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses. Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. The issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency determined that it is reasonable to believe that bamlanivimab may be effective in treating non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. And, when used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for the drug. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to bamlanivimab for the authorized population. As part of the evaluation of the EUA, the agency imposed several quality measures to protect patients. The company is required to implement these quality measures to manufacture this drug under the EUA. The data supporting this EUA for bamlanivimab are based on an interim analysis from a phase two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 465 non-hospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Of these patients, 101 received a 700-milligram dose of bamlanivimab, 107 received a 2,800-milligram dose, 101 received a 7,000-milligram dose and 156 received a placebo within three days of obtaining the clinical sample for the first positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test. The pre-specified primary endpoint in the phase two trial was change in viral load from baseline to day 11 for bamlanivimab versus placebo. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, cleared the virus by day 11. However, the most important evidence that bamlanivimab may be effective came from the predefined secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits within 28 days after treatment. For patients at high risk for disease progression, hospitalizations and emergency room visits occurred in 3% of bamlanivimab-treated patients on average compared to 10% in placebo-treated patients.  The effects on viral load and on reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits, and on safety, were similar in patients receiving any of the three bamlanivimab doses. The EUA allows for bamlanivimab to be distributed and administered as a single dose intravenously by health care providers. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using bamlanivimab in treating COVID-19 be made available to , including dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects of bamlanivimab include: anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, itching and vomiting. The EUA was issued to Eli Lilly and Company.

This is particularly critical during the COVID-19 public health emergency as certain segments of the population are being affected by the virus in different ways. These health disparities illustrate why it is important for developers of any medical product, such as treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, to endeavor to include diverse populations to understand their risks or benefits across all groups.

On Oct. 30, 2018, the FDA issued a inviting data and information on the occurrence and severity of sesame allergies in the U.S. and the prevalence of sesame-containing foods in the U.S. that are not required to disclose sesame as an ingredient. While the exact frequency of sesame allergies in the U.S. is unknown, it is estimated in some recent studies to be more than 0.1%, which is similar to allergies to soy and fish. The responses that the FDA received indicated that some allergic reactions, such as hives, vomiting, wheezing and anaphylaxis, may be occurring from products with undeclared sesame or products that contain ingredients like tahini. Federal law requires that foods containing one of the eight “major food allergens” – milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans – declare the food source of the allergen using its common or usual name on the label. The imposes strict requirements that foods containing one of these eight major allergens be clearly marked for the presence of these allergens. The FDA works closely with manufacturers to quickly recall such products from the market if they are mislabeled. While sesame is not one of the eight major allergens, the FDA, through this draft guidance, is encouraging food manufacturers to voluntarily label their products if they contain sesame, even when not required to do so. Additionally, the FDA continues to assess allergens of public health importance, including potential science-based options to empower consumers with information about these allergens.

As part of the FDA’s effort to protect consumers, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission issued warning letters to two companies for selling fraudulent COVID-19-related products. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. A U.S. District Court in Oklahoma granted a motion for default judgment and permanent injunction against Xephyr LLC dba N-Ergetics, Derrill Jinks Fussell, and Linda Sue Fussell for violating federal law by distributing their colloidal silver products as preventions or treatments for COVID-19. The order of permanent injunction that the Court issued permanently prohibits the defendants from, among other things, selling or distributing unapproved new drugs or misbranded drugs with claims that the products can cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent diseases in people, including COVID-19. In March, FDA issued a to defendants and requested that they immediately correct their violations, which they did not do. Today, the FDA alerted that false positive results can occur with antigen tests for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA is aware of reports of false positive results associated with antigen tests used in nursing homes and other settings, and continues to monitor and evaluate these reports and other available information about device safety and performance. The FDA reminds clinical laboratory staff and health care providers about the risk of false positive results with all laboratory tests. Clinical laboratory staff and health care providers can help ensure accurate reporting of test results by following the authorized instructions for use of a test and key steps in the testing process as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

When the levels are too low, consumers may need to take extra oxygen, known as oxygen therapy. One way to get extra oxygen into the body is by using an oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators are medical devices required to be sold and used only with a prescription. You should not to use an oxygen concentrator at home unless it has been prescribed by a health care provider.

{"title": "FDA Takes Efforts to Protect Patients from Potentially Harmful Compounded Drugs Through Finalizing Insanitary Conditions Guidance", "date": "November 06, 2020", "contents": " Protecting patients from exposure to poor quality compounded drugs is a fundamental part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s drug compounding program, and we are committed to protecting patients. While compounded drugs can serve an important role for patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product, these drugs have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety, effectiveness or quality. The FDA through its oversight of compounded drugs strives to help improve the quality of compounded drugs and reduce risk to patients. Under federal law, a drug is considered adulterated if it is prepared, packed or held under that could cause the drug to become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health. While some compounders work hard to meet quality standards, too often, FDA investigators continue to observe poor conditions at compounding facilities that impact drug quality and have the potential to harm patients who use the drugs. These insanitary conditions include dirt, mold, insects, trash, peeling paint, unclean exhaust vents and dirty high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, among many other examples. Numerous compounders have voluntarily recalled drug products intended to be sterile, and also temporarily or permanently stopped sterile operations because of these inspectional observations. The FDA has also taken regulatory and enforcement actions when we observe these insanitary conditions. Because of these and other concerning examples we have witnessed, today we’re releasing a to further our efforts to help compounders identify and prevent insanitary conditions at their facilities. The final guidance provides recent examples of insanitary conditions that we’ve observed at compounding facilities and details corrective actions that facilities should take when they identify these conditions. Based on comments to the revised draft guidance, we also added recommendations for compounders to use risk management tools to develop appropriate controls to prevent insanitary conditions at their facilities. Additionally, the guidance addresses the regulatory actions that the FDA may take in response to insanitary conditions. Through our oversight and regulatory actions, we address insanitary conditions at compounders’ facilities across the country. We will continue to take appropriate action to protect patients from poor quality drugs made in facilities that have insanitary conditions. And our collaborative work with states and the Department of Justice remains ongoing. Both traditional compounders and outsourcing facilities should take measures to avoid insanitary conditions. We urge compounders to use this valuable resource to better understand insanitary conditions and take necessary actions to avoid such issues for the safety of the patients who receive their drugs.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First Test that Detects Neutralizing Antibodies from Recent or Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection", "date": "November 06, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first serology test that detects neutralizing antibodies from recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are antibodies that bind to a specific part of a pathogen and have been observed in a laboratory setting to decrease SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of cells. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the , which specifically detects this type of antibody. Although the FDA has previously issued EUAs to more than 50 antibody (serology) tests, those tests only detect the presence of binding antibodies. Binding antibodies bind to a pathogen, such as a virus, but do not necessarily decrease the infection and destruction of cells. It’s important to note that the effect of neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is still being researched. The FDA cautions patients against using the results from this test, or any serology test, as an indication that they can stop taking steps to protect themselves and others, such as stopping social distancing, discontinuing wearing masks or returning to work. The FDA also wants to remind patients that serology tests should not be used to diagnose an active infection, as they only detect antibodies that the immune system develops in response to the virus, not the virus itself.

{"title": "FDA Issues Alert Regarding SARS-CoV-2 Viral Mutation to Health Care Providers and Clinical Laboratory Staff", "date": "January 08, 2021", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is alerting clinical laboratory staff and health care providers that the FDA is monitoring the potential impact of viral mutations, including an emerging variant from the United Kingdom known as the B.1.1.7 variant, on authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, and that false negative results can occur with any molecular test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 if a mutation occurs in the part of the virus’s genome assessed by that test. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can mutate over time, like all viruses, resulting in genetic variation in the population of circulating viral strains, as seen with the B.1.1.7 variant. The FDA is taking additional actions to ensure authorized tests remain accurate by working with test developers and conducting ongoing data analysis to evaluate all currently authorized molecular tests. The FDA believes the risk that these mutations will impact overall testing accuracy is low. “The FDA will continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 genetic viral variants to ensure authorized tests continue to provide accurate results for patients,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “While these efforts continue, we are working with authorized test developers and reviewing incoming data to ensure that health care providers and clinical staff can quickly and accurately diagnose patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, including those with emerging genetic variants. At this time, we believe the data suggests that the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines may still be effective against this strain. The FDA will continue to keep health care providers and the public informed of any new information as it becomes available.” The FDA has been monitoring SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations, and potential impact on testing, throughout the pandemic. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in a patient sample can potentially change the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 test. Tests that rely on the detection of multiple regions of the genome may be less impacted by genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome than tests that rely on detection of only a single region. Three currently authorized molecular tests, , may be impacted by genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2, but the impact does not appear to be significant. Importantly, the detection pattern that appears with the TaqPath and Linea diagnostic tests when certain genetic variants are present may help with early identification of new variants in patients to reduce further spread of infection. The recently identified B.1.1.7 variant has been associated with an increased risk of transmission, therefore early identification of this variant in patients may help reduce further spread of infection. The FDA has reminded clinical laboratory staff and health care providers about the risk of false negative results with all laboratory tests, including molecular tests. Laboratories should expect some false results to occur even when very accurate SARS-CoV-2 tests are used. Today’s announcement also provides important information and recommendations for clinical laboratory staff and health care providers who use molecular tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA will continue to communicate with the public as we have additional information to share. The FDA encourages stakeholders to report any adverse events or suspected adverse events experienced with molecular tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Voluntary reports can be submitted through . Health care personnel and clinical laboratory staff employed by facilities that are performing COVID-19 testing should follow the reporting requirements for authorized laboratories as specified in the test’s Emergency Use Authorization. Prompt reporting of adverse events can help the FDA identify and better understand the risks associated with medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Permits Marketing of New Device Designed to Reduce Sleep Disturbance Related to Nightmares in Certain Adults", "date": "November 06, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted marketing of a new device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 years or older who suffer from nightmare disorder or have nightmares from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The device provides gentle vibration through touch based on an analysis of heart rate and motion during sleep. is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, and most will recover from their symptoms over time. Those who continue to experience symptoms, which can include sleep problems and nightmares, may be diagnosed with PTSD. Certain medications may help address specific PTSD symptoms, such as sleep problems and nightmares. An experienced mental health professional can help people find the treatment plan that meets their symptoms and needs. The device, called Nightware, is a digital therapeutic that uses an Apple Watch and an Apple iPhone that are configured and logged into a software application and the Nightware server. Throughout the night, Apple Watch sensors monitor body movement and heart rate during sleep. These data are sent to the Nightware server and, using a proprietary algorithm, the device creates a unique sleep profile for the patient. When Nightware detects that a patient is experiencing a nightmare based on its analysis of heart rate and body movement, the device provides vibrations through the Apple Watch while the product is in use. Nightware is available by prescription only and is intended for home use. This device was studied in a 30-day randomized, sham-controlled trial of 70 patients. A sham therapy is an inactive treatment or procedure that is intended to mimic as closely as possible a therapy in a clinical trial. Patients in the sham group wore the device, but no vibratory stimulation was provided. Safety was assessed using validated measurements of suicidality and sleepiness, and there were no changes in either over the course of the study in either group. Sleep was assessed with two versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, the self-rated questionnaire for assessing sleep quality, including a version of that scale that is intended for patients with PTSD. Both the sham and active groups showed improvement on the sleep scales, with the active group showing greater improvement than sham. The evidence demonstrated the probable benefits outweighed the probable risks. Nightware is not a standalone therapy for PTSD. The device should be used in conjunction with prescribed medications for PTSD and other recommended therapies for PTSD-associated nightmares and nightmare disorder, according to relevant consensus guidelines. Nightware is intended to be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Patients who have been known to “act out” during their nightmares (sleepwalking, violence) should not use Nightware. A healthcare provider should be contacted if daytime sleepiness occurs (If you feel drowsy, do not drive or operate heavy machinery); if the watch vibration causes awakenings not associated with nightmares; or if nightmares persist, worsen, or recur. The watch included in the Nightware kit should be used every night when the user is planning to go to sleep. The watch should not be worn while reading or watching television in bed as this may trigger false alerts. Users should not wear the watch too tightly. If skin irritation occurs, users should discontinue the use of the watch and contact a healthcare provider. The watch included in the Nightware kit may disturb the sleep of the user’s bedpartner if the bedpartner is in contact with the watch when it vibrates. Patients are advised to avoid letting the watch come in contact with their bedpartner at night. Nightware was granted designation for the treatment of nightmares in patients with PTSD. Breakthrough Device designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The FDA reviewed the device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The regulation created is for digital therapy device to reduce sleep disturbance for psychiatric conditions, prescription devices that are intended to provide stimulation using a general purpose computing platform to reduce sleep disturbance in patients who experience this symptom due to psychiatric conditions such as nightmare disorder or PTSD.

{"title": "FDA Offers Guidance to Enhance Diversity in Clinical Trials, Encourage Inclusivity in Medical Product Development", "date": "November 09, 2020", "contents": " Throughout my career as a cancer doctor and medical researcher, I have been concerned about and have sought to address issues related to health care disparities. One important step that researchers and medical product sponsors can take to confront health care disparities is to make sure that clinical trials for medical products are more inclusive of multiple populations. We have seen these health care disparities, for example, during our fight against COVID-19, as certain segments of the population (e.g., older adults, pregnant women, children, and racial and ethnic minorities) are affected in different ways. This difference in impact illustrates why we must encourage developers of any medical product such as treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 – as well as medical products more broadly – to endeavor to include diverse populations to understand their risks or benefits across all groups. To further promote and protect public health, it is important that people who are in clinical trials represent the populations most likely to use the potential medical product. In that spirit, today the U.S Food and Drug Administration issued final guidance with the agency’s recommendations on designing and executing clinical trials of drugs and biologics that include people with different demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity, age, location of residency) and non-demographic characteristics (e.g., patients with organ dysfunction, comorbid conditions, and disabilities; those at weight range extremes; and populations with diseases or conditions with low prevalence). The final guidance issued today, “ ,” which was first issued as a draft in 2019, provides the agency’s current thinking on steps to broaden eligibility criteria in clinical trials through inclusive trial practices, trial designs, and methodological approaches. The guidance aims to provide recommendations for how sponsors can increase enrollment of underrepresented populations in their clinical trials. This guidance offers recommendations on how product sponsors can improve clinical trial diversity by accounting for logistical and other participant-related factors that could limit participation. For example, clinical trials requiring frequent visits to specific sites may place an added burden on participants. Sponsors are encouraged to think about reducing visit frequency, when appropriate, in addition to considering whether flexibility in visit windows is possible and whether electronic communications, such as phone, email, social media platforms, or other digital health technology tools can replace site visits and provide investigators with real-time data. Additionally, this guidance provides recommendations on broadening clinical trial eligibility criteria for clinical trials of investigational drugs intended to treat rare diseases and recommendations on improving enrollment and retention of participants with rare diseases. The guidance notes that sponsors should consider early engagement with patient advocacy groups and patients to elicit suggestions for designing trials that participants would be willing to enroll in and support. The guidance also includes other high-level considerations about inclusion of other important groups, including but not limited to: women, including pregnant women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, and older adults, and provides references to more specific guidances. Clinical trials, and the people who volunteer to participate in them, are essential to help develop safe and effective medical products to fight diseases and illnesses. The FDA remains committed to increasing enrollment of diverse populations in medical product development and will continue to engage with federal partners, medical product manufacturers, medical professionals, and health advocates to encourage this important goal."},

The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2020, there will have been more than 190,000 cases of prostate cancer in the U.S. One of the treatment options for advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy, which uses drugs to lower levels of the hormones that help prostate cancer cells grow. Current FDA-approved treatments of this type are injected or placed as small implants under the skin. Orgovyx is an orally administered treatment that works by blocking the pituitary gland from making hormones called luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, thereby reducing the amount of testosterone the testicles are able to make. The safety and efficacy of Orgovyx was evaluated in a randomized, open-label trial in men with advanced prostate cancer. The patients randomly received either Orgovyx once daily or injections of leuprolide, another hormone-targeting drug, every three months for 48 weeks. The objective was to determine if Orgovyx achieved and maintained low enough levels of testosterone (castrate levels), by day 29 through end of the treatment course. In the 622 patients who received Orgovyx, the castration rate was 96.7%. The most common side effects of Orgovyx include: hot flush, increased glucose, increased triglycerides, musculoskeletal pain, decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea and increased levels of certain liver enzymes. Androgen deprivation therapies such as Orgovyx may affect the heart’s electrical properties or cause electrolyte abnormalities, therefore healthcare providers should consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Based on findings in animals and the mechanism of action, Orgovyx can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female; it is advised that males with female partners of reproductive potential use effective contraception during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose of Orgovyx. Due to the drug’s suppression of the pituitary gonadal system, diagnostic test results of the pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after taking Orgovyx may be affected.

A conventional leg prosthesis uses a specially-fitted, cup-like shell called a socket that fits over the remaining portion of the patient’s leg (the residual limb remaining after amputation) to secure the device to the leg. Some patients may not have a long enough residual limb to properly fit a socket prosthesis or may have other conditions, such as scarring, pain, recurrent skin infections or fluctuations in the shape of the residual limb that prevent them from being able to use a prosthesis with a socket. The OPRA Implant System is surgically anchored and integrated into the patient’s remaining thigh bone to allow connection to an external prosthetic limb. The OPRA Implant System has been on the market under a since 2015. Humanitarian use devices are intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. Today’s approval expands the patient population eligible for this device. The OPRA Implant System is installed with two surgical procedures. In the first procedure, a cylinder-shaped fixture is implanted into the central canal of the remaining thigh bone. Approximately six months later, after tissue has grown to anchor the fixture and the skin tissue has healed, a second surgery is performed to attach additional device components of the OPRA Implant System to the fixture from the previous surgery. The OPRA Implant System extends through the skin at the bottom of the patient’s residual limb and connects to the prosthesis. After the second surgery, the patient works with a trained physical therapist to gradually place weight on the OPRA Implant System using a training prosthesis. Patients require about six months of training and rehabilitation after the second surgery, before being fitted with their own customized prosthesis by a trained prosthetist. The FDA evaluated the safety and effectiveness in a clinical study of 65 participants who received the OPRA Implant System. Effectiveness was assessed using the Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation, a patient reported outcome measure that reflects frequency of use, patient’s mobility, problems with the device and patient’s overall health. The average improvement in the prosthetic use score on a 100-point scale, was 35.1 points at two years and 39.6 points at five years as compared to their reported scores with a conventional socket prosthesis. Adverse events reported during the study included: infection, mechanical complications, pain, injury and loosening of the fixture. Patients should discuss with their health care providers the benefits and risks of all prosthetic options. The FDA reviewed the OPRA Implant System under the Premarket Approval (PMA) pathway. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA and is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).

{"title": "FDA Approves First Adjuvant Therapy for Most Common Type of Lung Cancer", "date": "December 18, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tagrisso (osimertinib) as the first adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a specific type of genetic mutation. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the U.S., approximately 229,000 adults will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020, of which 76% of cases will be non-small cell lung cancer. Approximately 20% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer will have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, which are mutations on a protein that causes rapid cell growth, and consequently, helps cancer spread. Although most patients who are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer have unremovable tumors, 30% have resectable disease; thus, more than 10,000 patients nationwide each year may be candidates for Tagrisso as adjuvant therapy after tumor removal. Tagrisso was in 2018 for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations. Tagrisso was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 682 patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive who had undergone complete tumor removal. A total of 339 patients received Tagrisso orally once daily and 343 received a placebo following recovery from surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy, if given. The main outcome measure was the amount of time it took for the cancer to come back or for death to occur from any cause (disease-free survival). In the overall trial population, patients who received Tagrisso had an 80% decrease in chance of disease recurrence compared with patients who received a placebo. The most common side effects of Tagrisso include diarrhea, rash, musculoskeletal pain, dry skin, skin inflammation around nails, sore mouth, fatigue and cough. Tagrisso should be withheld if patients develop symptoms of interstitial lung disease, and permanently discontinued if interstitial lung disease is confirmed. Tagrisso may affect the heart’s electrical system and can also cause issues such as heart failure so periodic monitoring should be conducted. Tagrisso may also cause inflammation of the cornea. Tagrisso can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; therefore, the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be confirmed before treatment with Tagrisso is started. Tagrisso should be withheld if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or erythema multiforme major is suspected. Tagrisso received for treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases. Additionally, the agency granted Tagrisso a for this indication.

{"title": "FDA Takes Additional Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for Second COVID-19 Vaccine", "date": "December 18, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the second vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergency use authorization allows the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. for use in individuals 18 years of age and older. The FDA has determined that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also show that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks—supporting the company’s request for the vaccine’s use in people 18 years of age and older. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality information. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. After a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, one month apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include an analysis of 30,351 participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in the U.S. These participants, 15,185 of whom received the vaccine and 15,166 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of more than two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. It is mandatory for ModernaTX, Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 28,207 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled U.S. study who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first dose of vaccine. Among these participants, 14,134 received the vaccine and 14,073 received placebo. The vaccine was 94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with 11 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group. At the time of the analysis of these 196 COVID-19 cases, none in the vaccine group and 30 in the placebo group were classified as severe. After the analysis of these 196 cases was completed, one severe case in the vaccine group was identified and is awaiting confirmation. At this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on Feb. 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and issued declarations that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine, in that a vaccine available under an EUA is not approved. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence to determine whether the product may be effective and also assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits. If the product meets the effectiveness standard and the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. ModernaTX, Inc. has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to the FDA to monitor the safety of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to ModernaTX, Inc. The authorization will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated. The EUA for Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance.

{"title": "FDA Marks Historic Public Health Milestone with Finalization of Two Key Rules for Companies Seeking to Market New Tobacco Products", "date": "January 19, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized two foundational rules for the premarket review of new tobacco products. These final rules provide additional information on the minimum requirements for the content, format and review of reports. PMTA and SE are two of the pathways through which a manufacturer can seek marketing authorization for a new tobacco product from the FDA. A PMTA is a type of application for any new tobacco product seeking an FDA marketing order. The FDA expects all premarket applications for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products will be submitted through the PMTA pathway. However, the FDA has also issued authorizations for combustible cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and non-combusted cigarettes through the PMTA pathway. , manufacturers or importers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product(s) would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That statutory standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. The agency’s evaluation includes such things as reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives, constituents, toxicological profile and health impact, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and labeled, findings from consumer perception research (if conducted), and the applicant’s description of marketing plans for the product. The PMTA final rule helps ensure these applications contain sufficient information for the FDA’s evaluation, including details on the physical aspects of a tobacco product and information on the product’s potential public health risks. The final rule describes the information an applicant must include in a PMTA for the FDA to complete a substantive review of an application. It also formalizes both the procedures the agency will follow when reviewing PMTAs and the postmarket reporting requirements for applicants that receive . The final rule also requires tobacco product manufacturers to keep records establishing that their tobacco products are legally marketed, such as documents showing that a tobacco product is not required to undergo premarket review or has received premarket authorization. In addition to content and format requirements, the final rule formalizes the general procedures the FDA follows when evaluating PMTAs, including application acceptance, application filing and inspections. The final rule also describes PMTA-related requirements for submitting application amendments, the time for review, withdrawal of applications, changes in ownership, post-market reporting, the maintenance of records, the FDA’s communications with an applicant and the FDA’s disclosure procedures and electronic submission requirements. The final rule also explains how applicants may submit a supplemental PMTA or a resubmission, which would improve efficiency in certain situations by not requiring the submission of a new PMTA. For example, a supplemental PMTA could be submitted when an applicant is seeking authorization for a modified version of a tobacco product for which they have already received a PMTA marketing granted order. A resubmission can be submitted to address application deficiencies following the issuance of a marketing denial order. The FDA has finalized this rule after receiving and reviewing comments during the public comment period for the , issued on Sept. 20, 2019. The final rule is based on the agency’s experience reviewing several types of premarket applications, including SE Reports, requests for exemptions from demonstrating SE, modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications, and PMTAs. The FDA has received and reviewed thousands of premarket applications for tobacco products, that range widely in the level of detail they contain. This experience has been helpful in developing the rule, which describes the information an applicant must include in a PMTA for the FDA to complete a substantive review of an application. The FDA will also withdraw its September 2011 draft guidance, because the topics described in the guidance are addressed in the final rule. The FDA expects SE to continue being the most commonly utilized pathway for applications for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, hookah tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco. In order for a new tobacco product to be , the FDA must determine either that it has the same characteristics as a , or that it has different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product but does not raise different questions of public health. As explained in the SE final rule, the SE Reports that the FDA has received range widely in the level of detail they include. Some of these reports include very little information on the comparison of the new tobacco product with a predicate tobacco product while other reports include much more. The SE final rule provides additional information on the minimum requirements for the content and format of SE Reports, allowing for greater predictability and efficiency for all stakeholders. The goal is for the final rule to bring greater uniformity to the consistency and completeness of SE Reports, and make the tobacco product review process more effective and efficient, providing applicants with a better understanding of the level of detail that an SE Report must contain. The SE final rule helps ensure SE Reports contain sufficient information for the FDA to evaluate the comparison of the new tobacco product to a predicate tobacco product. This rule will help ensure that an SE Report provides information necessary for the FDA to determine whether the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a tobacco product that is commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the U.S. as of Feb. 15, 2007, as required by law. The final rule also addresses the FDA’s communications with the applicant, the retention of records that support the SE Report, confidentiality of an SE Report, how an applicant can amend or withdraw an SE Report, how an applicant may transfer ownership of an SE Report to a new applicant, electronic submission of the SE Report and amendments. Both of these final rules are effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. The finalization of these rules helps ensure that all PMTAs and SE Reports that begin scientific review contain the basic information the agency needs to determine whether the new tobacco products meet the relevant premarket requirements to efficiently and effectively implement the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The FDA will continue to work on a separate rule for . That rule, when final, will provide details for those who seek to market a tobacco product as modified or lower risk, including how to organize and submit an MRTP application. The agency also will also continue efforts to assist industry in complying with federal tobacco regulations through meetings, webinars and guidance documents. By Sept. 9, 2020, manufacturers of deemed new tobacco products – including e-cigarette products – that were on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016 were required to submit a premarket application to the FDA. However, the agency is currently enjoined from enforcing premarket requirements for premium cigars. The agency continues to process the large number of submissions received and has already begun reviewing many applications. In the coming weeks, the FDA intends to provide a more detailed update on the agency’s progress since the Sept. 9, 2020 deadline.

{"title": "FDA Approves First Extended-Release, Injectable Drug Regimen for Adults Living with HIV", "date": "January 21, 2021", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Cabenuva (cabotegravir and rilpivirine, injectable formulation) as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. This is the first FDA-approved injectable, complete regimen for HIV-infected adults that is administered once a month. The FDA also approved Vocabria (cabotegravir, tablet formulation), which should be taken in combination with oral rilpivirine (Edurant) for one month prior to starting treatment with Cabenuva to ensure the medications are well-tolerated before switching to the extended-release injectable formulation. “Currently, the standard of care for patients with HIV includes patients taking daily pills to adequately manage their condition. This approval will allow some patients the option of receiving once-monthly injections in lieu of a daily oral treatment regimen,” said John Farley, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Having this treatment available for some patients provides an alternative for managing this chronic condition.” The safety and efficacy of Cabenuva were established through two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials in 1,182 HIV-infected adults who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/milliliter) before initiation of treatment with Cabenuva. Patients in both trials continued to show virologic suppression at the conclusion of each study, and no clinically relevant change from baseline in CD4+ cell counts was observed. The most common adverse reactions with Cabenuva were injection site reactions, fever (pyrexia), fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness and rash. Cabenuva should not be used if there is a known previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir or rilpivirine, or in patients who are not virally suppressed (HIV-1 RNA greater than 50 copies/milliliter). Cabenuva and Vocabria were granted designation by the FDA. The FDA granted the approval of Cabenuva and Vocabria to ViiV Healthcare.

The criminal investigation found that in a variety of online postings from as early as March 2020, the defendant, Johnny T. Stine, claimed to have a COVID-19 vaccine that he offered to inject in customers for $400-$1000 each. Stine’s company, North Coast Biologics, had previously received a from the agency for promoting an unapproved COVID-19 vaccine product. “Unproven injectable vaccines purported to prevent or treat COVID-19, made from unknown substances under unknown conditions, present significant health risks in and of themselves. They also can lead consumers to make lifestyle choices that increase their actual risk of infection with COVID-19, or to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment,” said Special Agent in Charge Lisa L. Malinowski, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. “The FDA will continue to investigate fraudulent COVID-19 treatments and bring to justice those who try to profit from the pandemic by offering unproven and illegally marketed coronavirus products.” The FDA is reissuing the for decontamination systems that are authorized to decontaminate compatible N95 respirators for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) to prevent exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates when there is an insufficient supply of new respirators resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Among other things, the reissued EUAs for certain decontamination systems are now only authorized to decontaminate each compatible N95 respirator a maximum of four or fewer times. Based on the FDA’s review of real-world use of these systems and evidence from adverse events and scientific literature, including studies regarding N95 respirator failures from simulated and real-world use, the FDA has determined that it is appropriate to protect the public health or safety to revise certain decontamination system EUAs to limit the number of decontamination cycles and respirator reuses permitted under each authorization.

{"title": "FDA authorizes marketing of new device designed to remove dead pancreatic tissue", "date": "December 23, 2020", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of the EndoRotor System to resect (cut out) and remove necrotic (dead) tissue for patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN), a potentially deadly condition which can occur several weeks after an episode of severe acute pancreatitis, often requiring tissue removal. Pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes and inflammation cause cellular damage or tissue death. Necrotizing pancreatitis occurs when part of the pancreas dies because of inflammation or injury. After several weeks, the area of necrosis may form a walled off cavity and become what is called walled-off pancreatic necrosis. It is necessary to remove the dead tissue if it becomes symptomatic, such as worsening pain, causing infection which can lead to sepsis, or resulting in an obstruction to the intestines. The EndoRotor System includes a power console, foot control, specimen trap and single-use catheter, and is used in a procedure called direct endoscopic necrosectomy that broadly consists of two steps. First, the user creates a portal, typically using a metallic stent, between the stomach and the necrotic cavity in the pancreas. This portal accommodates a standard endoscope—a flexible tube with a light and camera attached to aid in viewing the procedure. Second, the user places the EndoRotor through the working channel of the endoscope to cut and remove the necrotized tissue. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the EndoRotor System in a trial with 30 subjects (23 enrolled in the U.S.) with walled-off pancreatic necrosis who were indicated to undergo a direct endoscopic necrosectomy. Study subjects were treated using the EndoRotor System during the procedure. Subjects often required multiple procedures, for a total of 63 direct endoscopic necrosectomies with the EndoRotor System to remove necrotic debris from the pancreatic cavity. This averaged 2.1 procedures per subject. Clinicians determined how many treatments a subject had based on whether symptoms—such as infected necrosis, fever, sepsis or pain—persisted after each procedure. The device’s effectiveness was studied by how well it cleared necrotic tissue from the subject’s pancreas. The amount of necrotic tissue in each subject’s pancreas was measured during a computerized tomography scan with contrast before the procedure and compared to a follow up CT scan, endoscopy or MRI 14 to 28 days after the last procedure. For subjects undergoing procedures with the EndoRotor System, there was an average of 85% reduction in the amount of necrotic tissue, with half of the subjects having 98.5% clearance of their necrotic tissue. In the clinical trial, three subjects experienced procedure-related serious adverse events (a 10% complication rate). Two of these subjects experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. The third subject experienced a pneumoperitoneum (air leaking from the pancreatic cavity into the abdominal cavity) and later died after suffering from sepsis and multi-organ system failure caused by massive collections of infected pancreatic necrosis. Other serious adverse events recorded in the clinical trial, deemed to be due to the patient’s underlying condition and not related to the device or procedure, included hematemesis (vomiting of blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) and pancreatitis. The EndoRotor System should not be used in patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer per the assessment of the treating physician. The FDA is requiring a boxed warning to emphasize this important point. The FDA is aware of a patient death (outside of the U.S.) from pancreatic cancer three months after having necrotic pancreatic tissue removed with the EndoRotor System. This patient did not have a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer prior to treatment, although the patient’s outcome is believed to be unrelated to the device or procedure. The EndoRotor System should only be used in patients following other procedures to drain the walled-off pancreatic necrosis. The EndoRotor System should not be used in patients with walled-off necrosis who have a documented pseudoaneurysm (when a blood vessel wall is injured and the leaking blood collects in the surrounding tissue) greater than 1 cm within the cavity or with intervening gastric varices (swollen veins in stomach) or unavoidable blood vessels within the access tract; or in patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer. The FDA reviewed the EndoRotor System through the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no legally marketed predicate device to which the device can claim substantial equivalence. The FDA granted marketing authorization of the EndoRotor System to Interscope, Incorporated."},
{"title": "FDA Conditionally Approves First Oral Tablet to Treat Lymphoma in Dogs", "date": "January 11, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conditionally approved Laverdia-CA1 (verdinexor tablets) to treat dogs with lymphoma, a type of cancer of the lymph nodes and lymphatic system. Laverdia-CA1 works to prevent certain proteins from leaving the nucleus of cancer cells, thereby allowing these proteins to control the growth and prevent the spread of cancerous cells in dogs. Laverdia-CA1 is the first conditionally approved oral treatment for dogs with lymphoma. Because Laverdia-CA1 is orally administered, owners of dogs with a diagnosis of lymphoma, following a veterinarian prescription and safety directions detailed in a client information sheet, can administer this treatment at home. Laverdia-CA1 is given orally twice per week, with at least 72 hours between doses. Laverdia-CA1 is the second treatment for lymphoma in dogs that the FDA has conditionally approved. Tanovea-CA1, which received conditional approval in 2016, is an injectable drug. Conditional approval allows veterinarians to access needed treatments while the drug company collects additional effectiveness data, such as through trials with client-owned dogs. The company then has up to five years to complete effectiveness studies to support a full approval. The reasonable expectation of effectiveness of Laverdia-CA1 was established in a study with 58 client-owned dogs with B- or T-cell lymphoma who were followed for at least eight months. The dogs were either newly diagnosed with lymphoma (naïve) or were in their first relapse after completing a single or multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. The study included dogs of varying breeds, weights and both genders, with the majority of the dogs having lymphoma stage III (generalized lymph node enlargement). Seventeen of the 58 dogs (29%) did not show progression of lymphoma for at least 56 days after taking verdinexor. Three of these dogs did not show any progression for at least 182 days. The most common adverse reactions associated with verdinexor were anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy, increased water intake, increased urination, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. Laverdia-CA1 should be given to dogs immediately after eating, as this increases the amount of drug absorbed into the bloodstream. The package insert for prescribing veterinarians includes detailed user safety information and special instructions for handling and administering the drug. should always be worn when handling Laverdia-CA1 and cleaning up after a dog undergoing treatment and for three days following the last treatment. This includes handling the dog’s food and water bowls, as well as feces, urine, vomit or saliva from the dog. Laverdia-CA1 also comes with a client information sheet for prescribing veterinarians to give to their clients. This sheet is written specifically for dog owners and explains how to safely handle Laverdia-CA1, how to safely clean up after a dog undergoing treatment and other important safety information. Pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, and nursing women, should not handle or administer the drug or touch the feces, urine, vomit or saliva of treated dogs. Children also should not touch Laverdia-CA1 or the feces, urine, vomit or saliva of treated dogs. Laverdia-CA1 is available only by prescription due to the professional expertise required to diagnose canine lymphoma, provide adequate instructions for post-treatment care, and monitor the safe use of the product, including treatment of any adverse reactions. Laverdia-CA1 received conditional approval through the pathway, which is an option for drugs intended for minor uses in major species (dogs, cats, horses, cattle, pigs, turkeys and chickens) or for minor species. Canine lymphoma affects fewer than 70,000 dogs in the U.S. each year, and therefore, qualifies as a minor use in a major species. The FDA granted conditional approval of Laverdia-CA1 to Anivive Lifesciences Inc. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Takes Further Steps to Confront Opioid Crisis Through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Programs", "date": "December 23, 2020", "contents": " While our efforts to combat COVID-19 remain at the forefront of our day-to-day activities, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also continues its work on a number of important public health issues and, in particular, the opioid crisis. We remain committed to using all facets of our regulatory authority to lessen the impact of opioid addiction, misuse, and abuse while also striking a careful balance between patient access and safety to ensure that patients suffering from significant pain have access to appropriate medication. To that end, the FDA has been and continues to address this public health crisis on a number of fronts, including efforts to: Part of our regulatory authority efforts include requiring Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for various opioid analgesics to help mitigate the serious risks associated with their use. Today, we took further steps to strengthen the REMS program for transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) products to help ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks. TIRF medicines contain fentanyl, a powerful opioid, and are used to manage breakthrough pain in adults with cancer who are routinely taking other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock for pain. To use the TIRF medicines safely, these patients must be opioid tolerant based on concurrent regular use of another opioid medication. Despite the decline in the use of TIRF medicines in recent years, data have suggested that prescribing of TIRF medicines still occurs in patients who are not opioid tolerant. With this in mind, the FDA finalized modifications to the REMS program to address the persistence of these concerning prescribing practices. These changes will also improve our ability to monitor for adverse events and ensure safe use of these medicines. In particular, this program has been strengthened to: In addition to the modifications to fortify the TIRF REMS program, the FDA also continues efforts to evaluate the opioid analgesic (OA) REMS. Earlier this month, we hosted a workshop inviting scientific discussions about methods to evaluate the impact of the OA REMS on prescriber behavior and patient outcomes. The goal of the OA REMS is to educate prescribers and other health care providers (including pharmacists) on the treatment and monitoring of patients with pain. The public workshop served as a forum for public scientific discussion of innovative, multidisciplinary methods to consider when evaluating the OA REMS education program. The FDA will use these discussions to ensure that the methods ultimately used to evaluate the OA REMS are scientifically sound. Effectively addressing the opioid crisis requires continued focus and collaboration across many different stakeholders. The FDA’s REMS are an important tool, and it’s critical we ensure they are continuing to fulfill their purpose. Decrease unnecessary exposure to prescription opioids and prevent new addiction; Support the treatment of those with opioid use disorder; Foster the development of new and effective pain therapies; and Take action against those who contribute to the illegal importation and sale of opioid products. Require that prescribers document a patient’s opioid tolerance with each prescription of a TIRF medicine for outpatient use; Require outpatient pharmacies dispensing TIRF medicines to document and verify a patient’s opioid tolerance before dispensing; Require inpatient pharmacies to develop internal policies and procedures to verify opioid tolerance in patients who require TIRF medicines while hospitalized; and Require a new patient registry for use, along with other data sources, to monitor for accidental exposure, misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose."},

{"title": "FDA Issues Emergency Use Authorization for Third COVID-19 Vaccine", "date": "February 27, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the third vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The EUA allows the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S for use in individuals 18 years of age and older. The FDA has determined that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks, supporting the company’s request for the vaccine’s use in people 18 years of age and older. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is manufactured using a specific type of virus called adenovirus type 26 (Ad26). The vaccine uses Ad26 to deliver a piece of the DNA, or genetic material, that is used to make the distinctive “spike” protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While adenoviruses are a group of viruses that are relatively common, Ad26, which can cause cold symptoms and pink eye, has been modified for the vaccine so that it cannot replicate in the human body to cause illness. After a person receives this vaccine, the body can temporarily make the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a single dose. The available safety data to support the EUA include an analysis of 43,783 participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study being conducted in South Africa, certain countries in South America, Mexico, and the U.S. The participants, 21,895 of whom received the vaccine and 21,888 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of eight weeks after vaccination. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate in severity and lasted 1-2 days. As part of the authorization, the FDA notes that it is mandatory for Janssen Biotech Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine: serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Janssen Biotech Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports submitted to the FDA. The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 39,321 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study being conducted in South Africa, certain countries in South America, Mexico, and the U.S. who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to receiving the vaccine. Among these participants, 19,630 received the vaccine and 19,691 received saline placebo. Overall, the vaccine was approximately 67% effective in preventing moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination. Additionally, the vaccine was approximately 77% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 85% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination. There were 116 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group that occurred at least 14 days after vaccination, and 348 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group during this time period. There were 66 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination and 193 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group during this time period. Starting 14 days after vaccination, there were 14 severe/critical cases in the vaccinated group versus 60 in the placebo group, and starting 28 days after vaccination, there were 5 severe/critical in the vaccine group versus 34 cases in the placebo group. At this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on Feb. 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and issued declarations that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine, in that a vaccine available under an EUA is not approved. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence to determine whether the product may be effective and also assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits If the product meets the effectiveness standard and the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. Janssen Biotech Inc. has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to the FDA describing its commitment to monitor the safety of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Janssen Biotech Inc., a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson. The authorization will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated. The EUA for Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance."},

The Hominis Surgical System is intended for benign hysterectomy (removal of the uterus for non-cancerous conditions) with salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of one or both fallopian tubes and ovaries). RASD, sometimes referred to as robotic surgical devices or computer-assisted surgical devices, are not actually robots. The devices cannot perform surgery without direct human control. RASD enable a surgeon to use computer and software technology to control and move surgical instruments through one or more tiny ports (incisions or orifices) in the patient’s body and in a variety of surgical procedures or operations. RASD technology facilitates performing minimally-invasive surgery and complex tasks in confined areas inside the body. To remove the uterus, the Hominis Surgical System uses minimally-invasive surgical instruments inserted through the vagina (transvaginal approach) and a video camera inserted laparoscopically through a small incision on the abdomen for visualization of the instruments inside the patient. The transvaginal approach requires fewer incisions on the abdomen compared to conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, surgeons in the operating room control the instruments from the Hominis Surgical System console. The FDA will require the manufacturer to develop and provide a comprehensive training program for surgeons and operating room staff to complete before operation of the device. In addition to its assessment of performance and engineering testing, the FDA evaluated safety and effectiveness in a clinical study of 30 patients undergoing transvaginal total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy or salpingectomy for benign conditions, using the Hominis Surgical System. Patients had varying characteristics such as ages ranging from 37 to 79 years, body mass index from 17.6–40, and 63% of patients had different comorbidities, such as high cholesterol, osteoporosis or high blood pressure. All 30 procedures with the Hominis Surgical System were successfully completed and there were no conversions to an open or other laparoscopic surgical approach. Observed adverse events included minor blood loss, urinary tract infection and delayed healing of the closure made at the top of the vagina (vaginal cuff) that is done as part of a hysterectomy. The FDA reviewed the device through the premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type.

Today, Judge Edward R. Korman, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entered an order of permanent injunction against Confidence USA Inc., of Long Island, New York, and the company’s president Helen Chian and general manager and founder Jim Chao. The permanent injunction requires the defendants to cease manufacturing, holding, or distributing dietary supplements until the FDA notifies defendants that they may resume operations. Confidence USA Inc. has manufactured and distributed more than 50 dietary supplements under brand names that include Confidence USA, American Best, USA Natural, and The Herbal Store. Confidence USA Inc. currently manufactures and distributes the above-mentioned dietary supplement products through Amazon, Walmart, and its own online store at www.confidenceusa.com. The court found that defendants violated the FD&C Act because their products were prepared, packed, or held in violation of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements. Multiple FDA inspections showed that the defendants repeatedly failed to verify the identity of each dietary ingredient used in the manufacture of their supplements. The defendants also failed to verify that their products met specifications for purity, strength, composition, and contamination limits. The court order prohibits the defendants from receiving, processing, manufacturing, preparing, packing, holding and distributing any article of food, including dietary supplements, until they hire an independent expert to ensure that they are following the CGMP regulations, and, following an inspection, receive the FDA’s approval to resume operations. Following the court order, once defendants resume operations, they must retain an independent auditor to ensure that they continue to follow the CGMP regulations.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA takes steps to streamline path for COVID-19 screening tools, provides information to help groups establishing testing programs", "date": "March 16, 2021", "contents": " Testing remains an important cornerstone of our nation’s fight against COVID-19. This includes schools, workplaces, communities and other locations using testing to screen asymptomatic individuals who may still spread the virus. Screening involves testing asymptomatic individuals who do not have known or suspected exposure to COVID-19 in order to make individual decisions, such as whether an individual should participate in an activity, based on the test results. Today, we are providing information for test developers about a streamlined path to emergency use authorization for these important screening tools as well as information to help these groups as they set up testing programs. Our actions complement those taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are not intended to replace CDC’s testing or other public health guidance. First, the FDA issued a for test developers seeking emergency use authorization (EUA) of certain tests for screening with serial testing. Serial testing involves testing the same individual multiple times within a few days, and can increase chances of detecting asymptomatic infection that might not always show up with a single test. CDC recommends serial testing at least once per week, along with other mitigation measures, such as masking and social distancing, to reduce disease transmission. This template applies to developers of molecular and antigen tests, for use in serial testing programs, as well as at-home tests for use in a serial manner outside of a testing program, intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection. This includes tests conducted in any location, including in a laboratory, at the point-of-care (POC), or even places such as a person’s home or certain non-traditional sites such as offices, sporting venues, airports, schools, etc. We believe this effort will pave the way for further expanding the availability of tests authorized for screening asymptomatic individuals, help bolster existing and new testing programs and increase consumer access to testing. As part of this new template for test developers, the agency provided recommendations aimed to streamline the authorization of screening tests with serial testing. The recommendations apply to test developers who seek an EUA from the FDA for certain screening tests prior to conducting certain performance evaluations with asymptomatic individuals. For example, in certain circumstances, a POC test or an at-home test could be authorized for over-the-counter (OTC) use without the need for validating its use in asymptomatic individuals prior to authorization. The FDA believes that evidence of a test’s strong performance in symptomatic patients combined with serial testing can mitigate the risk of false results when testing asymptomatic individuals. Additionally, today the FDA that outlines considerations for selecting a test for use in a screening testing program. The fact sheet will help schools, workplaces, communities and other locations as they are selecting a test for screening and help them understand the difference between tests used for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 compared to those used for screening asymptomatic individuals. This information we’re providing will be helpful to groups as they set up testing programs. We believe these combined efforts will further expand the availability of tests authorized for screening asymptomatic individuals, including OTC use, help bolster existing and new testing programs and increase consumer access to testing.

{"title": "FDA Permits Marketing of First SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Test Using Traditional Premarket Review Process", "date": "March 17, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , a diagnostic test for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections. The diagnostic test, which had an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), was granted marketing authorization using the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. The grant of this De Novo request marks an important step in FDA’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic because it is the first SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test that will be permitted to be marketed beyond the public health emergency. The grant of the De Novo request for this test is based on additional data showing validation beyond what is needed for emergency use authorization. The FDA reviewed data from a clinical study of more than 500 test samples and a variety of analytical studies, which demonstrated a reasonable assurance that the BioFire RP2.1 was safe and effective at identification and differentiation of various respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens. With granting of the De Novo for the BioFire RP2.1 today, the FDA has also revoked the EUA for this device, which was initially authorized for emergency use in May 2020. This EUA revocation and De Novo authorization do not impact the availability other tests under EUA. The BioFire RP2.1 is for use only in individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19. This diagnostic test is for the detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of respiratory infection and aids in the diagnosis of respiratory infection if used along with other clinical and epidemiological information. Results of the test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Positive results of this test do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The agent(s) detected by the BioFire RP2.1 may not be the definite cause of disease. Negative BioFire RP2.1 results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by an NPS specimen. Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection. Along with this De Novo authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria called special controls that define the requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, in combination with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The FDA granted the marketing authorization to BioFire Diagnostics LLC.

In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered. Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given. CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution. This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot. Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare. COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government, and we take all reports of health problems following COVID-19 vaccination very seriously. People who have received the J&J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider. Health care providers are asked to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at CDC and FDA will provide additional information and answer questions later today at a media briefing. A of that media call is available on the FDA’s YouTube channel."},

The agency refers to its use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. This guidance describes how remote interactive evaluations will be requested by the FDA and conducted for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency at any facility where pharmaceutical products, including biological products, are manufactured, processed, packed or held; facilities covered under the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The agency will use existing risk management methods and related tools to determine when to request a facility’s participation in a remote interactive evaluation. The FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, including pre-approval and pre-license, post-approval, surveillance, for-cause and bioresearch monitoring programs. The agency will consider each of these inspectional program areas as possible candidates for remote interactive evaluations, recognizing that there will be instances where only an inspection will be appropriate. The FDA intends to use information from remote interactive evaluations to meet user-fee commitments and to update facilities information, when deemed appropriate based on risk and history of compliance with FDA regulations. Facilities can choose to decline the FDA’s request to perform a remote facility evaluation; however, this may delay the agency’s ability to evaluate the facility or product and make a regulatory decision. The FDA will not accept requests from applicants or facilities to perform a remote interactive evaluation, as decisions to offer a remote interactive evaluation will rest with FDA, based on risk and compliance history."},

{"title": "FDA Approves First Immunotherapy for Initial Treatment of Gastric Cancer ", "date": "April 16, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo (nivolumab), in combination with certain types of chemotherapy, for the initial treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma. This is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer. There are approximately 28,000 new diagnoses of gastric cancer each year in the U.S. With currently available therapy, overall survival is generally poor; the rate of cure with resection is very low and the survival rate for all stages is 32%. The 5-year survival rate for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is 5%. Opdivo is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor growth by enhancing T-cell function. Its efficacy was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of 1,581 patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The 789 patients who received Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy, on average, lived longer than the 792 patients who received chemotherapy alone. Median survival was 13.8 months for patients who received Opdivo plus chemotherapy compared to 11.6 months for patients who received chemotherapy alone. The most common side effects of Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy include peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord), nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, constipation and musculoskeletal pain. Opdivo can cause serious conditions known as immune-mediated side effects, including inflammation of healthy organs such as the lungs (pneumonitis), colon (colitis), liver (hepatitis), endocrine glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis). Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they have immune system problems, lung or breathing problems, liver problems, have had an organ transplant, or are pregnant or plan to become pregnant before starting treatment. Opdivo received Priority Review and Orphan Drug designations for this indication. Priority Review designation directs overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The FDA granted approval to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This review was conducted under , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab", "date": "April 16, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, , to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients. Based on its ongoing analysis of emerging scientific data, specifically the sustained increase of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure, the FDA has determined that the known and potential benefits of bamlanivimab, when administered alone, no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for its authorized use. Therefore, the agency determined that the criteria for issuance of an authorization are no longer met and has revoked the EUA. On Nov. 9, 2020, based on the totality of scientific evidence available at the time, the FDA issued an EUA to Eli Lilly and Co. authorizing the emergency use of bamlanivimab alone for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Importantly, although the FDA is now revoking this EUA, alternative monoclonal antibody therapies remain available under EUA, including , for the same uses as previously authorized for bamlanivimab alone. The FDA believes that these alternative monoclonal antibody therapies remain appropriate to treat patients with COVID-19 when used in accordance with the authorized labeling based on information available at this time. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses, like SARS-CoV-2. Like other infectious organisms, SARS-CoV-2 can mutate over time, resulting in genetic variation in the population of circulating viral strains. The FDA has a responsibility to regularly review the appropriateness of an EUA, and as such, the agency will review emerging information associated with the emergency uses for the authorized products. Recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) national genomic surveillance program show an increased frequency of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are expected to be resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone. As of mid-March 2021, approximately 20% of viruses sequenced in the U.S. were reported as variants expected to be resistant to bamlanivimab alone, increasing from approximately 5% in mid-January 2021. Additionally, there are currently no testing technologies available that enable health care providers to test individual patients for SARS-CoV-2 viral variants prior to start of treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, empiric treatment with monoclonal antibody therapies that are expected to work broadly against variants across the nation should be used to reduce the likelihood of treatment failure. The FDA will continue working closely with other federal governmental agencies, including the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, on the surveillance of variants that may impact the monoclonal antibody therapies authorized for emergency use. The agency remains committed to providing timely and transparent communication as additional information becomes available."},

Reprocessing these types of medical devices involves both cleaning and high-level disinfection or sterilization so the devices can be reused. Cystoscopes, cystourethroscopes and ureteroscopes are urological endoscopes that allow health care providers to see and access the urinary tract (e.g., urethra, bladder, ureters and kidneys) during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. From Jan. 1, 2017 through Feb. 20, 2021, the FDA received over 450 MDRs describing post-procedure patient infections or other possible contamination issues associated with reprocessing these devices. In those reports that provided the name of the device manufacturer, either Olympus Corporation or Karl Storz were cited. MDRs can be submitted by mandatory reporters, such as manufacturers, importers and device user facilities, or by voluntary reporters. Olympus submitted three reports citing patient death from a bacterial infection that occurred outside of the U.S. Two of those reports were associated with a forceps/irrigation plug, an accessory component used to control water flow and enable access to the working channel of the endoscope. Lab tests confirmed the same infectious bacteria was present in both the forceps/irrigation plug and in the patient with the infection. The third patient death report involved a cystoscope that did not pass a leak test, indicating possible damage to the device, which could have been an underlying factor in the infection. It is unknown whether or to what degree the reported infections or patient co-morbidities contributed to the patient deaths. It is important to note that MDRs are not, by themselves, definitive evidence of a faulty or defective medical device and cannot be used to establish or compare rates of event occurrence. The FDA is continuing to investigate these reports, but, at this time the agency has not concluded that any specific manufacturer or brand of these devices is associated with higher risks than others. The Letter to Health Care Providers issued today provides recommendations for reprocessing and using these devices, including following the reprocessing instructions, not using a device that has failed a leak test, developing schedules for routine device inspection and maintenance, and discussing the potential benefits and risks associated with procedures involving reprocessed urological endoscopes with patients. Ensuring the safety of reprocessed medical devices, which are used in multiple patients, is a shared responsibility among the FDA and other federal agencies, public health systems, state and local health departments, medical device manufacturers, health care facilities, professional societies and others. The FDA is actively engaged to better understand the causes and risk factors for transmission of infectious agents and develop solutions to minimize patient exposure. The actions the FDA is taking on urological endoscopes today were informed by the agency’s experience with duodenoscopes. Since 2015, the FDA has communicated about and taken action on , including requiring postmarket safety studies and updating sampling and culturing protocols. The agency also updated its 2015 to include more device types that need reprocessing validation data. The FDA has issued Warning Letters to manufacturers and safety communications to the public and health care providers and held a public Advisory Committee meeting seeking information on how to effectively reprocess medical devices. In addition, the FDA has encouraged manufacturers to transition to devices with features that eliminate the need for reprocessing and helped manufacturers modify and validate their reprocessing instructions. The problems the FDA has identified with urological endoscopes and duodenoscopes may apply to similar devices. Therefore, the agency is also reviewing information on other types of endoscopes. The FDA will continue to keep health care providers and the public informed if new or additional information becomes available on adverse events and other issues related to reprocessing urological endoscopes.

{"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Makes Two Revisions to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Emergency Use Authorization to Help Increase the Number of Vaccine Doses Available", "date": "April 01, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced two revisions regarding the number of doses per vial available for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The first revision clarifies the number of doses per vial for the vials that are currently available, in that the maximum number of extractable doses is 11, with a range of 10-11 doses. The second revision authorizes the availability of an additional multi-dose vial in which each vial contains a maximum of 15 doses, with a range of 13-15 doses that can potentially be extracted. Depending on the type of syringes and needles used to extract each dose, there may not be sufficient volume to extract more than 10 doses from the vial containing a maximum of 11 doses or more than 13 doses from the vial containing a maximum of 15 doses. To support these changes to the emergency use authorization, the FDA evaluated data showing the number of doses that could be extracted from the vials and on the fill volumes for both vials that were submitted by ModernaTX, Inc. have been revised to reflect the new information and are intended to help frontline workers administering COVID-19 vaccines understand the number of doses that can potentially be extracted per vial. Because the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain preservative, any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one full dose. If one vial becomes contaminated during use, pooling doses from multiple vials can spread contamination to other vials. Use of contaminated vials may cause serious bacterial infections in vaccinated individuals. The updated information in the revised Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers and Prescribing Information provides instructions to not pool vaccine from multiple vials. The dosing regimen remains unchanged; the vaccine is administered as a two-dose series, 0.5 mL each dose, one month apart. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
{"title": "FDA Approves First Targeted Therapy for Subset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "date": "May 21, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Rybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) as the first treatment for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have specific types of genetic mutations: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations. The FDA also approved the Guardant360 CDx (Guardant Health Inc.) as a companion diagnostic for Rybrevant today. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, according to the American Cancer Society. Approximately 2% to 3% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer will have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are a group of mutations on a protein that causes rapid cell growth, and consequently, helps cancer spread. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most common type of EGFR mutation. Researchers evaluated Rybrevant’s efficacy in a study of 81 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The main outcome measured was overall response rate (proportion of patients whose tumor is destroyed or reduced by a drug). In the trial population in which all patients received Rybrevant, the overall response rate was 40%. The median duration of response was 11.1 months, with 63% of patients having a duration of response of 6 months or more. The most common side effects of Rybrevant include rash, infusion-related reactions, skin infections around the fingernails or toenails, muscle and joint pain, shortness of breath, nausea, fatigue, swelling in the lower legs or hands or face, sores in the mouth, cough, constipation, vomiting and changes in certain blood tests. Rybrevant should be withheld if patients develop symptoms of interstitial lung disease and permanently discontinued if interstitial lung disease is confirmed. Patients taking Rybrevant should limit sun exposure during and for two months after treatment. Rybrevant may cause problems with vision. Rybrevant can also cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; therefore, the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be confirmed before treatment is started. Rybrevant received for this indication. Priority Review directs overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The FDA granted approval of Rybrevant to Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. This review was conducted under , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners.

Plasminogen deficiency leads to an accumulation of fibrin, causing the development of growths (lesions) that can impair normal tissue and organ function and may lead to blindness when these lesions affect the eyes. The active ingredient in Ryplazim is plasminogen, purified from human plasma. Treatment with Ryplazim helps to increase the plasma level of plasminogen - enabling a temporary correction of the plasminogen deficiency and reduction or resolution of the lesions. The effectiveness and safety of Ryplazim is primarily based on one single-arm, open-label (unblinded) clinical trial enrolling 15 adult and pediatric patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1. All patients received Ryplazim administered every two to four days for 48 weeks. The effectiveness of Ryplazim was demonstrated by at least 50% improvement of their lesions in all 11 patients who had lesions at baseline, and absence of recurrent or new lesions in any of the 15 patients through the 48 weeks of treatment. The most common side effects reported by patients who received Ryplazim were abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, bleeding, limb pain, fatigue, constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, joint pain, and back pain. The FDA granted Ryplazim designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases. The application also received . The FDA’s rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program is intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics to prevent and/or treat rare diseases in children. Patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1 may bleed from active disease-related lesions. The use of Ryplazim may prolong or worsen active bleeding. Tissue sloughing (peeling/shedding) has also been observed. Because Ryplazim is derived from human plasma, it carries a risk of transmitting infectious agents. Based on effective donor screening procedures and product manufacturing processes, the risk of infectious disease transmission is remote. The FDA granted approval to ProMetic Biotherapeutics Inc."},

{"title": "FDA Grants Accelerated Approval for Alzheimer’s Drug", "date": "June 07, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aduhelm (aducanumab) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, a debilitating disease affecting 6.2 million Americans. Aduhelm was approved using the , which can be used for a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. Accelerated approval can be based on the drug’s effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients, with a required post-approval trial to verify that the drug provides the expected clinical benefit. Alzheimer’s is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. While the specific causes of Alzheimer’s disease are not fully known, it is characterized by changes in the brain—including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles—that result in loss of neurons and their connections. These changes affect a person’s ability to remember and think. Aduhelm represents a first-of-its-kind treatment approved for Alzheimer’s disease. It is the first new treatment approved for Alzheimer’s since 2003 and is the first therapy that targets the fundamental pathophysiology of the disease. Researchers evaluated Aduhelm’s efficacy in three separate studies representing a total of 3,482 patients. The studies consisted of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging studies in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Patients receiving the treatment had significant dose-and time-dependent reduction of amyloid beta plaque, while patients in the control arm of the studies had no reduction of amyloid beta plaque. These results support the accelerated approval of Aduhelm, which is based on the surrogate endpoint of reduction of amyloid beta plaque in the brain—a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid beta plaque was quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to estimate the brain levels of amyloid beta plaque in a composite of brain regions expected to be widely affected by Alzheimer’s disease pathology compared to a brain region expected to be spared of such pathology. The prescribing information for Aduhelm includes a warning for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which most commonly presents as temporary swelling in areas of the brain that usually resolves over time and does not cause symptoms, though some people may have symptoms such as headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, or nausea. Another warning for Aduhelm is for a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria. The most common side effects of Aduhelm were ARIA, headache, fall, diarrhea, and confusion/delirium/altered mental status/disorientation. Under the accelerated approval provisions, which provide patients suffering from the disease earlier access to the treatment, the FDA is requiring the company, Biogen, to conduct a new randomized, controlled clinical trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA may initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. Aduhelm was granted designation, which seeks to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions where initial evidence showed the potential to address an unmet medical need. Aduhelm is made by Biogen of Cambridge, Massachusetts."},

PROWL-SS is designed to assess the presence, bother and impact of four visual symptoms (double images, glare, haloes and starbursts) and satisfaction with vision in patients undergoing LASIK surgery in support of both premarket and post-market medical device regulatory reviews. LASIK stands for Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis and is a procedure that permanently changes the shape of the cornea, the clear covering of the front of the eye, using an excimer laser device. An MDDT is scientifically validated for use in device evaluation and to support regulatory decision-making. Examples of MDDTs are clinical outcome assessments, assessments of biomarkers, and non-clinical assessment methods or models. Qualification means that the FDA has evaluated the tool and concurs with available supporting evidence that the tool produces scientifically plausible measurements and works as intended within the specified context of use. The use of a qualified MDDT by a product sponsor is voluntary. Patient-Reported Outcomes with LASIK (PROWL) is a self-administered, web-based questionnaire that was developed through the LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project, a partnership between the FDA, the National Eye Institute and the Department of Defense, that included two prospective, observational studies conducted from 2011-2014. The full PROWL questionnaire consists of up to 125 questions. The MDDT qualification submission for the PROWL-SS, proposed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, includes 32 items from the full PROWL questionnaire that assess four key visual symptoms: double images, glare, halos, and starbursts, as well as an additional item to assess patient satisfaction with vision. The PROWL-SS is an instrument that can be used to assess specific patient-reported vision symptoms and satisfaction with vision after LASIK surgery. In addition to providing device developers with important information on clinical outcomes, the PROWL-SS, administered prior to and following LASIK surgery, can help enhance understanding of the potential risks of severe visual symptoms that can result from LASIK. The FDA continues to encourage patients to discuss all of the possible benefits and risks related to LASIK surgery with their health provider to help determine if they are a good candidate for this procedure. Health care professionals and patients should report any adverse events related to LASIK to MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.

The FDA also approved Pradaxa oral pellets to prevent recurrent clots among patients 3 months to less than 12 years old who completed treatment for their first venous thromboembolism. In addition, Pradaxa was approved in capsule form to treat blood clots in patients eight years and older with venous thromboembolism directly after they have been treated with a blood thinner given by injection for at least five days, and to prevent recurrent clots in patients eight years and older who completed treatment for their first venous thromboembolism. Pradaxa is the first FDA-approved blood thinning medication that children can take by mouth; the only other approved blood thinning medication for children is given by injection. Pradaxa was originally approved in 2010 to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Blood clots can be a serious problem in children as well as adults. Children are most at risk for blood clots if they have cancer, congenital heart disease, a central venous catheter, or are admitted to an intensive care unit. Venous thromboembolism can lead to complications, including swelling and discomfort near the clot, chest pain, lung damage, and even death. The safety and efficacy of Pradaxa for treating blood clots in patients younger than 18 was evaluated in one study of 267 pediatric patients. In this open-label study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either Pradaxa or standard of care. The study compared the two groups for the number of patients who met the composite endpoint (a combination of multiple clinical endpoints), which meant that they had not died from a blood clot, their blood clots had completely resolved, and they had no additional blood clots. Results showed that 81 (45.8%) of the 177 people taking Pradaxa met the composite endpoint compared to 38 (42.2%) of the 90 patients who received standard of care. The safety of Pradaxa to prevent recurrent blood clots in the same pediatric population was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in 214 patients with a history of blood clots. The primary endpoints of the study were recurrence of blood clots, major and minor bleeding events, and death (both overall and related to blood clots). The safety of Pradaxa with long-term use was similar to the previously discussed study. Recurrence of blood clots occurred in three patients (1.4%), which was comparable to prior standard-of-care treatments. The most common side effects of Pradaxa include digestive system symptoms and bleeding. Pradaxa can cause serious and fatal bleeding. Pradaxa is not recommended for patients with bioprosthetic heart valves or triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Pradaxa has a boxed warning cautioning that early treatment discontinuation may increase the risk of blood clots and that blood accumulation within parts of the spinal cord (spinal or epidural hematomas) in patients undergoing spinal procedures may cause serious side effects. Pradaxa received a designation for this indication. The FDA granted the approval of Pradaxa to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},

This decision is based on clear science and evidence establishing the addictiveness and harm of these products and builds on important, previous actions that banned other flavored cigarettes in 2009. The agency is taking urgent action to reduce tobacco addiction and curb deaths. There is strong evidence that a menthol ban will help people quit. Studies show that menthol increases the appeal of tobacco and facilitates progression to regular smoking, particularly among youth and young adults. Menthol masks unpleasant flavors and harshness of tobacco products, making them easier to start using. Tobacco products with menthol can also be more addictive and harder to quit by enhancing the effects of nicotine. One suggests that banning menthol cigarettes in the U.S. would lead an additional 923,000 smokers to quit, including 230,000 African Americans in the first 13 to 17 months after a ban goes into effect. An earlier projected that about 633,000 deaths would be averted, including about 237,000 deaths averted for African Americans. If implemented, the FDA’s enforcement of any ban on menthol cigarettes and all flavored cigars will only address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers and retailers. The FDA cannot and will not enforce against individual consumer possession or use of menthol cigarettes or any tobacco product. The FDA will work to make sure that any unlawful tobacco products do not make their way onto the market. These actions are an important opportunity to achieve significant, meaningful public health gains and advance health equity. The FDA is working expeditiously on the two issues, and the next step will be for the agency to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register allowing an opportunity for public comment. The agency also recognizes the importance of ensuring broad and equitable access to all the tools and resources that can help currently addicted smokers seeking to quit, including those who smoke menthol cigarettes and would be impacted by these public health measures. The FDA will work with partners in other federal agencies to make sure the support is there for those who are trying to quit. Smokers interested in quitting today should visit or call 1-800-QUIT-NOW to learn about cessation services available in their state. The FDA also remains focused on its regulatory oversight of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). The Center for Tobacco Products recently on its ongoing work of conducting the premarket review of ENDS and other tobacco product applications, and has issued warning letters to ENDS product manufacturers and retailers who continue to sell products that are illegally on the market. The FDA has also made a significant investment in a multimedia e-cigarette public education campaign. The campaign targets nearly 10.7 million youth aged 12-17 who have ever used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them, and highlights information about the potential risks of e-cigarette use. Today, the FDA granted a citizen petition requesting that the agency pursue rulemaking to prohibit menthol in cigarettes, affirming its commitment to proposing such a product standard. The 2009 Tobacco Control Act (TCA) did not include menthol in its ban on characterizing flavors in cigarettes, leaving menthol cigarettes as the only flavored combusted cigarettes still marketed in the U.S. The law instructed the FDA to further consider the issue of menthol in cigarettes. Since then, the FDA sought input from an , and further demonstrated its interest by issuing , undertaking an and supporting broader research efforts—all to better understand the differences between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes and the impact of menthol on population health. In the U.S., it is estimated that there are nearly 18.6 million current smokers of menthol cigarettes. But use of menthol cigarettes among smokers is not uniform: out of all Black smokers, nearly 85% smoke menthol cigarettes, compared to 30% of White smokers who smoke menthols. In addition, among youth, from 2011 to 2018, declines in menthol cigarette use were observed among non-Hispanic White youth but not among non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic youth. After the 2009 statutory ban on flavors in cigarettes other than menthol, use of flavored cigars increased dramatically, suggesting that the public health goals of the flavored cigarette ban may have been undermined by continued availability of these flavored cigars. Flavored mass-produced cigars and cigarillos are combusted tobacco products that can closely resemble cigarettes, pose many of the same public health problems, and are disproportionately popular among youth and other populations. In 2020, non-Hispanic Black high school students reported past 30-day cigar smoking at levels twice as high as their White counterparts. Nearly 74% of youth aged 12-17 who use cigars say they smoke cigars because they come in flavors they enjoy. Among youth who have ever tried a cigar, 68% of cigarillo users and 56% of filtered cigar users report that their first cigar was a flavored product. Moreover, in 2020, more young people tried a cigar every day than tried a cigarette."},
{"title": "FDA Approves Higher Dosage of Naloxone Nasal Spray to Treat Opioid Overdose", "date": "April 30, 2021", "contents": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today the approval of a higher dose naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray product to treat opioid overdose. The newly approved product delivers 8 milligrams (mg) of naloxone into the nasal cavity. The FDA had previously approved 2 mg and 4 mg naloxone nasal spray products. Naloxone is a medicine that can be administered by individuals with or without medical training to help reduce opioid overdose deaths. If naloxone is administered quickly, it can counter the opioid overdose effects, usually within minutes. A higher dose of naloxone provides an additional option in the treatment of opioid overdoses. Over the last several years, the FDA has taken a number of steps to improve availability of naloxone products, including: encouraging manufacturers to pursue approval of over-the-counter naloxone products; requiring drug manufacturers for all opioid pain relievers and medicines to treat opioid use disorder to add new recommendations about naloxone to the prescribing information; and extending the shelf life of naloxone nasal spray from 24 months to 36 months. The FDA is committed to using its regulatory authority to address the opioid crisis with a focus on: decreasing exposure to opioids and preventing new addiction; fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies; supporting treatment of those with opioid use disorder; and improving enforcement and assessing benefit-risk. The use of naloxone in patients who are opioid-dependent may result in opioid withdrawal characterized by body aches, diarrhea, increased heart rate (tachycardia), fever, runny nose, sneezing, goose bumps (piloerection), sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness and increased blood pressure. The FDA granted approval of KLOXXADO to Hikma Pharmaceuticals through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A new drug application submitted through this pathway may rely on the FDA’s finding that a previously approved drug is safe and effective or on published literature to support the safety and/or effectiveness of the proposed product, if such reliance is scientifically justified. In this case, the manufacturer submitted a 505(b)(2) application that relied, in part, on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for naloxone hydrochloride (NARCAN injection) to support approval. The applicant demonstrated that reliance on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for Narcan was scientifically justified and provided KLOXXADO-specific pharmacokinetic data to establish the drug’s safety and efficacy for its approved use. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

{"title": "FDA Approves Treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease", "date": "April 30, 2021", "contents": " Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Farxiga (dapagliflozin) oral tablets to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression. Chronic kidney disease occurs when the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood normally. Due to this defective filtering, patients can have complications related to fluid, electrolytes (minerals required for many bodily processes), and waste build-up in the body. Chronic kidney disease sometimes can progress to kidney failure. Patients also are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke. The efficacy of Farxiga to improve kidney outcomes and reduce cardiovascular death in patients with chronic kidney disease was evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind study. In this study, 4,304 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Farxiga or a placebo. The study compared the two groups for the number of patients whose disease progressed to a composite (or combined) endpoint that included at least a 50% reduction in kidney function, progression to kidney failure, or cardiovascular or kidney death. Results showed that 197 of the 2,152 patients who received Farxiga had at least one of the composite endpoint events compared to 312 of the 2,152 patients who received a placebo. The study also compared the two groups for the number of patients who were hospitalized for heart failure or died from cardiovascular disease. A total of 100 patients who received Farxiga were hospitalized or died compared to 138 patients who received a placebo. Farxiga was not studied, nor is expected to be effective, in treating chronic kidney disease among patients with autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic (characterized by multiple cysts) kidney disease or among patients who require or have recently used immunosuppressive therapy to treat kidney disease. Patients should not use Farxiga if they have a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to the medication or if they are on dialysis treatment. Serious, life-threatening cases of Fournier’s Gangrene have occurred in patients with diabetes taking Farxiga. Patients should consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) if they are also taking Farxiga. Farxiga can cause dehydration, serious urinary tract infections, genital yeast infections, and metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis (acid build-up in the blood). Patients should be assessed for their volume status and kidney function before starting Farxiga. Farxiga was originally approved in 2014 to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in addition to diet and exercise. Farxiga received designations for the indication being approved today. Fast track is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Priority review directs overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The FDA granted the approval of Farxiga to AstraZeneca."},

The American public puts its trust in the agency to ensure that all medical products, including COVID-19 vaccines, meet the agency’s standards for quality, safety and effectiveness. As part of our regulatory processes for reviewing all manufacturing facilities, the FDA recently completed an inspection of Emergent BioSolutions, a proposed manufacturing facility for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine. As Johnson & Johnson last month, the FDA has not authorized this facility to manufacture or distribute any of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine or components and, to date, no COVID-19 vaccine manufactured at this plant has been distributed for use in the U.S. The FDA’s inspections are thorough, and these assessments review the quality of manufacturing procedures, including records, staff training, facility operations, drug production and testing and the systems in place to ensure product quality. During an inspection of Emergent BioSolutions that ended Tuesday, the FDA cited a number of observations concerning whether the facility’s processes met our requirements and standards. These observations are outlined in our inspection closeout report, also known as a “FDA Form 483.” The FDA’s observations are intended to identify certain conditions observed during an inspection that have the potential to lead to quality issues during the manufacturing of a product. Once we observe such conditions, we can then work with a company to help identify a path forward to remedy the issues. Indeed, it is often in the public’s best interest that the FDA work with firms to quickly resolve compliance matters to ensure that the public has access to medical products that meet the agency’s high standards for quality, safety and effectiveness. In the case of Emergent BioSolutions, we are working with the company to address the . At the agency’s request, Emergent BioSolutions has agreed to pause new production while it works with the FDA to resolve potential quality issues. For the vaccines already manufactured, the products will undergo additional testing and will be thoroughly evaluated to ensure their quality before any potential distribution. We will not allow the release of any product until we feel confident that it meets our expectations for quality. These actions are unrelated to an ongoing evaluation by the FDA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of extremely rare cases of a specific type of blood clot reported in a very small number of individuals after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine. We are doing everything we can to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccines that are given to the people of this nation have met the agency’s high standards for quality, safety and effectiveness.

The amendment applies only to pooling of anterior nasal respiratory specimens. To utilize this approach, EUA holders must submit a notification to FDA with specific required information, including validation data (if requesting to pool more than three specimens) and pooling procedures. After this notification is given, the test will be identified on the FDA website and updated labeling will be posted with the test’s EUA on the FDA website. The public, including organizations purchasing tests to use for testing pooled specimens in serial testing programs, will be able to see the full list of tests authorized for any additional indication under this amendment on the FDA website as well as search the main EUA list on the FDA website to quickly find tests authorized for “pooled serial screening” which will be added as an attribute for each test amended by this authorization. Last month, the FDA issued a for test developers seeking emergency use authorization of certain tests for screening with serial testing. This Pooling and Serial Testing Amendment builds upon that earlier action. All serial testing programs should include retesting individuals as needed. Additionally, testing does not replace the need for other public health measures such as getting vaccinated, social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks."},
{"title": "FDA Releases Investigation Report Following Fall 2020 Outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 Illnesses Linked to Leafy Greens", "date": "April 06, 2021", "contents": " As part of our ongoing efforts to combat foodborne illness, today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a report on the investigation into the linked to the consumption of leafy greens grown in the California Central Coast. The report describes findings from the investigation, as well as trends that are key to understanding leafy green outbreaks that are linked to the California Central Coast growing region, specifically encompassing the Salinas Valley and Santa Maria growing areas every fall since 2017. We released our earlier this year that noted this investigation found the outbreak strain in a sample of cattle feces collected on a roadside about a mile upslope from a produce farm. This finding drew our attention once again to the role that cattle grazing on agricultural lands near leafy greens fields could have on increasing the risk of produce contamination, where contamination could be spread by water, wind or other means. In fact, the findings of foodborne illness outbreak investigations since 2013 suggest that a likely contributing factor for contamination of leafy greens has been the proximity of cattle. Cattle have been repeatedly demonstrated to be a persistent source of pathogenic E. coli, including E. coli O157:H7. Considering this, we recommend that all growers be aware of and consider adjacent land use practices, especially as it relates to the presence of livestock, and the interface between farmland, rangeland and other agricultural areas, and conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement risk mitigation strategies, where appropriate. Increasing awareness around adjacent land use is one of the specific goals of the we released last March, which we’re also announcing is being updated today to include new activities for 2021. During our analysis of outbreaks that have occurred each fall since 2017, we have determined there are three key trends in the contamination of leafy greens by E. coli O157:H7 in recent years: a reoccurring strain, reoccurring region and reoccurring issues with activities on adjacent land. The 2020 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak associated with leafy greens represents the latest in a repeated series of outbreaks associated with leafy greens that originated in the Central Coast of California (encompassing Salinas Valley and Santa Maria) growing region. In the investigation, the FDA recommends that growers of leafy greens in the California Central Coast Growing Region consider this reoccurring E. coli strain a reasonably foreseeable hazard, and specifically of concern in the South Monterey County area of the Salinas Valley. It is important to note that farms covered by the are required to implement science and risk-based preventive measures in the rule, which includes practices that prevent the introduction of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards into or onto produce. The FDA also recommends that the agricultural community in the California Central Coast growing region work to identify where this reoccurring strain of pathogenic E. coli is persisting and the likely routes of leafy green contamination with STEC. Specifically, we have outlined specific recommendations in our investigation report for growers in the California Central Coast leafy greens region. Those recommendations include participation in the and the California Agricultural Neighbors workgroup. When pathogens are identified through microbiological surveys, pre-harvest or post-harvest testing, we recommend growers implement industry-led root cause analyses to determine how the contamination likely occurred and then implement appropriate prevention and verification measures. We issued the Leafy Green Action Plan last year to foster a more urgent and collaborative approach to preventing leafy greens outbreaks caused by STEC. We have updated our plan for 2021 to include a renewed emphasis on actions to help prevent contamination from adjacent land, to include new actions that build on the accomplishments and learnings from the 2020 plan, and to renew our commitment to actions that were difficult to accomplish in 2020 due to challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA has made significant progress on our Leafy Greens Action Plan this year by enhancing prevention strategies, improving response activities by the agency and other entities, and identifying and addressing the knowledge gaps that exist around STEC contamination of leafy greens. We launched the California Longitudinal Study, developed an efficacy protocol for the development and registration of antimicrobial treatments for pre-harvest agricultural water and took critical steps to advance traceability of leafy greens. We have also conducted several focused inspections, follow-up investigations and sampling assignments. Although the FDA is keenly focused on taking steps to help mitigate recurring leafy green contamination events, we alone cannot fix this issue. Industry leadership and collaboration among growers, processors, retailers, state partners and the broader agricultural community is critical to reducing foodborne illnesses. At the FDA, the safety of leafy greens remains a top priority, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to address this significant public health issue and further protect consumers.

This includes, for example, individuals who are 65 years of age and older or individuals who have certain medical conditions. The safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy continues to be evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Sotrovimab is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. This treatment has not shown benefit in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. The issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency determined that it is reasonable to believe that sotrovimab may be effective in treating adults and certain pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. And, when used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for the drug. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to sotrovimab. The data supporting this EUA for sotrovimab are based on an interim analysis from a phase 1/2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 583 non-hospitalized adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Of these patients, 291 received sotrovimab and 292 received a placebo within five days of onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The primary endpoint was progression of COVID-19 (defined as hospitalization for greater than 24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any cause) through day 29. Hospitalization or death occurred in 21 (7%) patients who received placebo compared to 3 (1%) patients treated with sotrovimab, an 85% reduction. The FDA is carefully monitoring circulating viral variants and their sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies authorized to treat COVID-19, including sotrovimab. Laboratory testing showed that sotrovimab retains activity against the current circulating variants first reported in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, California, New York and India. The EUA allows for sotrovimab to be distributed and administered as a 500 milligram single dose intravenously by health care providers. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using sotrovimab in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and to patients, parents and caregivers, including dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Potential side effects of sotrovimab include anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions, rash and diarrhea. The EUA was issued to GlaxoSmithKline."},

This is the first approved targeted therapy for tumors with any KRAS mutation, which accounts for approximately 25% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers. KRAS G12C mutations represent about 13% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers. Lung cancer, the most common cancer type with the highest mortality, can largely be categorized by the genetic mutations that cause it. KRAS is a type of mutation in a group of genes that help regulate cell growth and division. Researchers evaluated the efficacy of Lumakras in a study of 124 patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer with disease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. The major outcomes measured were objective response rate (proportion of patients whose tumor is destroyed or reduced) and duration of response. The objective response rate was 36% and 58% of those patients had a duration of response of six months or longer. The approved 960 milligram dose is based on available clinical data, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling that support the approved dose. As part of the evaluation for this accelerated approval, the agency is requiring a postmarketing trial to investigate whether a lower dose will have a similar clinical effect. The most common side effects of Lumakras include diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, liver damage and cough. Lumakras should be withheld if patients develop symptoms of interstitial lung disease and permanently discontinued if interstitial lung disease is confirmed. Health care professionals should monitor a patient’s liver function tests prior to starting and when taking Lumakras. If a patient develops liver damage, Lumakras should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued. Patients should avoid taking acid-reducing agents, drugs that induce or are substrates for certain enzymes in the liver and drugs that are substrates of the P-glycoprotein while taking Lumakras. Lumakras was approved using the pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Lumakras. The FDA granted this application designations. Lumakras also received designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.

The budget request also seeks increases to help address complex challenges facing the country such as the ongoing opioid crisis and promoting health equity among underserved communities,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to ensure the FDA has the resources it needs to carry out our vital mission to protect and promote public health.” The FY 2022 request, which covers the period from Oct. 1, 2021, through Sep. 30, 2022, includes the following budget authority increases: To complement the funding requests, the agency’s budget proposal also includes a package of legislative proposals designed to bolster the FDA’s authorities to further its mission to protect and promote public health. Notable proposals include efforts to: These funding and legislative proposals align with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ goals of Strengthening National and Global Readiness for the Next Public Health Crisis, Promoting Health Equity by Addressing Racial Disparities, Providing Funding to Reduce the Maternal Mortality Rate and End Race-Based Disparities in Maternal Mortality, Promoting Biomedical Research and Establishing the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health and Advancing the Goal of Ending the Opioid Crisis. The FDA’s budget includes funding to support critical public health infrastructure needs including enterprise-wide data modernization, improvements to its federal buildings and facilities, expanded laboratory safety efforts and increased internal capacity to support the agency’s growing workforce of over 18,000. This funding will provide vitally needed investments to modernize the FDA’s outdated data infrastructure, ensure labs and facilities are safe, functional and integrated with program needs and support fundamental FDA operations to keep pace with new requirements, legislation and regulatory responsibilities. The budget provides increases to core food and medical product safety programs that require significant investments to address unmet public health funding needs, as well as emerging issues of concern. Food safety investments include funding to support implementation of the New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint to reduce the number of illnesses attributed to FDA-regulated foods; bolstering the funding provided to programs which are responsible for maternal and infant health and nutrition; providing much needed additional funds to address numerous emerging food-related chemical and toxicological issues; and strengthening animal food safety oversight. Medical product safety investments include providing dedicated programmatic funding to strengthen and monitor the supply chain; increasing drug safety surveillance and oversight; and improving animal drug safety and predictive technologies. The budget provides increases to address public health needs and key investments to tackle complex challenges facing the country. Investments include increasing safe and secure inspections, promoting health equity and addressing the opioid crisis by supporting development of new therapies and smarter enforcement. Expand the FDA's authorities for device shortages to assure a more resilient domestic supply chain and help reduce dependence on foreign production; Expand the FDA’s authority to explicitly provide for the ability to request records or other information in advance of or in lieu of inspections to help ensure the availability of emerging and medically necessary products that mitigate, diagnose treat, prevent or cure disease when travel to or inspection of an establishment is inadvisable; Expand the agency’s authority to require any manufacturer of infant formula, essential medical food for patients with certain inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency) or other designated category of food to provide shortage notifications, at a reasonable time and manner during a declared public health emergency; Clarify the FDA’s authorities to improve the agency’s ability to assess human and animal pharmaceutical critical infrastructure as well as manufacturing quality and capacity, particularly around product discontinuances and manufacturing interruptions; Expand the FDA’s authorities to require, when likely to help prevent or mitigate a shortage, that a drug sponsor evaluate, submit studies to the FDA and label a product with the longest possible expiration date that the agency agrees is scientifically justified; and Extend current provisions related to counterfeit drugs to include medical devices to help keep counterfeit products out of the United States and facilitate enforcement actions against those that find their way into interstate commerce."},

The FDA is recommending health care personnel and facilities transition away from crisis capacity conservation strategies, such as decontaminating or bioburden reducing disposable respirators for reuse. Based on the increased domestic supply of new respirators approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) currently available to facilitate this transition, the FDA and CDC believe there is adequate supply of respirators to transition away from use of decontamination and bioburden reduction systems. As part of the FDA’s effort to protect consumers and animals, the agency issued warning letters jointly with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to two companies for selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims. The FDA requested the companies take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider. Testing updates: The first company, , sells products, including “Silver Soul Immune Support”, “Silver Soul Body Spray” and “Vitality C60,” and misleadingly represents that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19 in people and animals. The second company, , sells “Puriton” topical skin products, and misleadingly represents that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19 in people. As of today, 354 tests and sample collection devices are authorized by the FDA under emergency use authorizations (EUAs). These include 258 molecular tests and sample collection devices, 75 antibody and other immune response tests, and 21 antigen tests. There are 43 molecular authorizations and 1 antibody authorization that can be used with home-collected samples. There is one molecular prescription at-home test, two antigen prescription at-home test, four over-the-counter (OTC) at-home antigen test, and one OTC molecular test. The FDA has authorized 6 antigen tests and 1 molecular test for serial screening programs."},
{"title": "FDA Releases Action Plan for Reducing Exposure to Toxic Elements from Foods for Babies, Young Children", "date": "April 08, 2021", "contents": " Protecting one of our most vulnerable populations, babies and young children, is among the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s highest priorities. Today, we’re announcing a new action plan, , that sets forth our approach to reducing exposure to toxic elements in foods commonly eaten by babies and young children to the lowest possible levels. Although the shows that children are not at an immediate health risk from exposure to toxic elements at the levels found in foods, we are starting the plan’s work immediately, with both short- and long-term goals for achieving continued improvements in reducing levels of toxic elements in these foods over time. We recognize that Americans want zero toxic elements in the foods eaten by their babies and young children. In reality, because these elements occur in our air, water and soil, there are limits to how low these levels can be. The FDA’s goal, therefore, is to reduce the levels of , cadmium and in these foods to the greatest extent possible. We are also sensitive to the fact that requiring levels that are not currently feasible could result in significant reductions in the availability of nutritious, affordable foods that many families rely on for their children. Our plan, therefore, outlines a multi-phase, science-based, iterative approach to achieving our goal of getting levels of toxic elements in foods closer to zero over time. Closer to Zero includes research and evaluation of changes in dietary exposures to toxic elements, setting action levels (recommended limits of toxic elements in foods that can be achieved by industry and progressively lowered as appropriate), encouraging adoption of best practices by industry, and monitoring progress. Our action plan will occur in three phases. As part of the first phase, we’ll immediately begin our work setting action levels using a four-pronged approach: Once the FDA has published final action levels, the agency will establish a timeframe for assessing industry’s progress toward meeting the action levels and recommence the cycle to determine if the scientific data support efforts to further adjust the action levels downward. Our action plan will start with prioritizing our work on those elements for which we have the most data and information – arsenic and lead – while research continues on other elements, progressing through each element over time across various categories of foods consumed by babies and young children. During the plan’s first year (phase one), we will be proposing action levels for lead in categories of foods consumed by babies and young children, consulting with and gathering data from stakeholders and federal partners on issues such as the feasibility of meeting action levels for lead, and sharing resources with industry on best practices for reducing or preventing lead contamination. We will also complete updated sampling assignments testing toxic element levels in baby foods and evaluate the science related to arsenic exposure from foods beyond infant rice cereal. Phases two, three and beyond are outlined in our plan. Through this plan, we’ll also take measures to ensure that limiting exposure to toxic elements in foods does not have unintended consequences—like limiting access to foods that have significant nutritional benefits by making them unavailable or unaffordable for many families, or unintentionally increasing the presence of one toxic element when foods are reformulated to reduce the presence of another. In addition, our goal of moving closer to zero reflects the reality that fruits, vegetables, and grains do take up toxic elements in the environment as they grow. With a cycle of continual improvement and collaboration, we aim to push the levels of toxic elements in these foods closer and closer to zero over time. While our testing of toxic elements in foods has shown there have already been significant reductions of toxic elements found in foods, the FDA is confident that our new plan will help further advance our work in this area. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce exposure to toxic elements from foods, we’ll be continuing our research and collaborations on this topic, finalizing action levels for arsenic in apple juice and issuing draft action levels for lead in juices in the near future, evaluating the potential impact of new technologies, interventions, or mitigation controls to reduce exposure, and reevaluating risks based on declining levels of toxic elements in foods. We view this work and our Closer to Zero plan as part of a larger effort to improve maternal and infant nutrition and health. We plan to combine our efforts to reduce exposure to toxic elements in baby foods with other FDA initiatives to improve the health of mothers, infants, and children. Again, it’s important to note that the shows that children are not at an immediate health risk from exposure to toxic elements at the levels found in foods. However, we know that additional progress can be made and are confident that a science-driven, transparent and inclusive process will help lead to even further reductions in exposure to these toxic elements. We look forward to providing additional updates on our plan as new data, information, progress updates and additional material are made available. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."},
